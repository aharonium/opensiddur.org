  The life of Rabbi Meir Leibush ben Yeḥiel Michel (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malbim">MALBIM</a>, 1809-1879) as a wandering rabbi and brilliant intellect reflects the changing expectations of Jews and Jewish religious authorities during the period of emancipation in 19th century Eastern Europe. In his capacity as the chief rabbi of Bucharest, Romania, MALBIM composed a prayer for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandru_Ioan_Cuza">Prince Alexander Ioan I Cuza</a> (1820-1873), Domnitor. The prince had united the Danube principalities of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moldavia">Moldavia</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallachia">Wallachia</a> in 1862 to form the Kingdom of Romania. During his reign, he managed to bring about a series of important land reforms benefiting the peasantry of Romania, and he did try to improve the situation for Jews under his rule. The emancipation of the Jews of Romania, announced with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proclamation_of_Islaz">Proclamation of Islaz</a> during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallachian_Revolution_of_1848">Wallachian Revolution of 1848</a>, had never actually gone into effect. In 1865, the prince announced a project which would lead to the "gradual emancipation of the people of Mosaic faith" but this effort was never realized due to Alexandru Ioan's forced abdication and replacement by a Prussian King in 1866.

The life of Rabbi Meir Leibush ben Yeḥiel Michel (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malbim">MALBIM</a>, 1809-1879) as a wandering rabbi and brilliant intellect reflects the changing expectations of Jews and Jewish religious authorities during the period of emancipation in 19th century Eastern Europe.[foot][caption id="attachment_5981" align="alignnone" width="221"]<a href="http://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/On-the-Main-Line-Malbim-Sukkah-decoration-crop.png"><img src="http://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/On-the-Main-Line-Malbim-Sukkah-decoration-crop-221x300.png" alt="Rendering of the Malbim circa 1882,  (via On the Main Line Blog)" width="221" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-5981" /></a> Rendering of the Malbim circa 1882,  (via <a href="http://onthemainline.blogspot.com/2009/10/another-sukkah-decoration.html">On the Main Line Blog</a>)[/caption][/foot] His first published commentary was on Megillat Esther (1845). The Malbim's fame and popularity rests upon his commentary on the Tanakh (1876). His political life as a community rabbi, however, is a tragic one.

In his capacity as the chief rabbi of Bucharest, Romania, the Malbim composed the prayer above for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandru_Ioan_Cuza">Prince Alexander Ioan I Cuza</a> (1820-1873), Domnitor. The prince had united the Danube principalities of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moldavia">Moldavia</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallachia">Wallachia</a> in 1862 to form the Kingdom of Romania. During his reign, he managed to bring about a series of important land reforms benefiting the peasantry of Romania, and he did try to improve the situation for Jews under his rule. The emancipation of the Jews of Romania, announced with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proclamation_of_Islaz">Proclamation of Islaz</a> during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallachian_Revolution_of_1848">Wallachian Revolution of 1848</a>, had never actually gone into effect. In 1865, the prince announced a project which would lead to the "gradual emancipation of the people of Mosaic faith" but this effort was never realized due to Alexandru Ioan's forced abdication and replacement by a Prussian King in 1866.

Elayne Grossbard writes that the prayer was composed "to celebrate the Romanian national holiday on 24 January 1862, when it was read publicly by the chief rabbi and by the congregation."[foot]Grosbard continues, "Besides being printed on paper at the time, the words were also printed in Hebrew and Romanian on a silk banner decorated with the national coat of arms.[/foot]

Grosbard writes, "The MALBIM was a controversial figure because of his differences with the local community and he used this occasion to deliver a sermon bemoaning his ill treatment and appealing for support." <a href="http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Meir_Leib_ben_Yehiel_Mikhael">YIVO explains</a> the strained relationship between the Malbim and the Jewish community of Bucharest, which led to his arrest in 1862 sometime after the prayer above was composed:
<blockquote>
In the 1850s, a group of Jews led by Iuliu Barasch (“the Mendelssohn of Romanian Jewry”) had fought for Jewish emancipation and Jewish cultural advancement through secular schools and through the establishment of a choral temple with an organ and choir. Upon his arrival [in Bucharest in 1858], Malbim sought to bolster Orthodox observance (by setting kashrut standards, building an <em>‘eruv</em> [boundary permitting Jews to carry on the Sabbath], establishing a Hebrew press in Bucharest, popularizing Torah study, and preaching Sabbath observance) and took drastic steps to thwart the Reform movement by withdrawing funding from modern schools, halting the choral temple’s construction, and even prohibiting kosher butchers from selling to those who did not observe the Sabbath. The influential reformers attacked Malbim as a fanatic and, turning to the government, accused him of impeding Jewish assimilation into society, of being unpatriotic, and, most seriously, of blaspheming Christianity in his commentaries. The government responded in 1862 by banning Malbim from preaching, removing his title of chief rabbi, and withdrawing the Bucharest Jewish community’s authority to raise taxes and manage its own affairs.

Malbim’s family life during this period was unsettled, as Aharon, the only child from his second marriage, died in childhood, and Ḥayah [his wife], suffering from depression, behaved erratically, spent beyond the family’s means, and maligned her husband openly. In the public sphere, Malbim benefited from the support of Orthodox Bucharest Jews who petitioned the government to lift the ban on his preaching, an opportunity Malbim took to condemn his opponents publicly. Continuing battles ultimately led to his imprisonment and to his expulsion from Romania in 1864. Unwilling to capitulate, Malbim traveled to Constantinople to sue the Romanian government, demanding reinstatement and back wages; he received support from Sir Moses Montefiore and from the Prussian consulate, which protested his mistreatment as a Prussian national. He also traveled to Paris to enlist the help of Adolphe Crémieux (president of the Alliance Israélite Universelle), who sent a protest letter directly to the Romanian ruler, Alexandru Cuza. Malbim won reparations on condition that he officially resign as rabbi of Romania.
</blockquote>

What I find remarkable is how this prayer, composed by one man for another, is situated just at the intersection of both of their lives, each of which begins to strangely track each other, if not geographically then tragically. Each of their lives becomes terribly complicated by separate but related historical currents that soon remove both of them from their office and position, and ultimately, out of Romania entirely.
