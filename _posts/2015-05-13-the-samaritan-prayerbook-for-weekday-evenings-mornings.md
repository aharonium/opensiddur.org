  This is the beginning of an Israelite-Samaritan daily prayerbook. This work is still very much in progress. The file includes the title page, the Samaritan equivalent of "birkot hashahar" (the early morning blessings before prayer), and the first couple of pages of actual prayer. It is all in Samaritan script, an offshoot of paleo-Hebrew which developed after the Jews had already switched to today's square "ashurit" script.

This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritans">Israelite-Samaritan</a> weekday prayerbook includes blessings for washing before prayer, the text of the Samaritans' two daily prayers (evening and morning), and their <em>nusaḥ</em> for counting the ʿOmer between the first Sunday of Pesaḥ and the holiday of Shavuʿot.

This file is all in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritan_alphabet">Samaritan script</a>, an offshoot of paleo-Hebrew which developed after the Jews had already switched to today's square "Ashurit" script.[foot]Israelite Samaritan's call "Ashurit" script, Aramaic Hebrew script[/foot] At the end of the prayerbook, I've added a short pronunciation guide for those familiar with English or modern Hebrew.

<strong>NEW</strong>: You can now download the prayerbook transliterated into <strong>modern Hebrew characters</strong> ("Ashurit"). The text is completely vowelled according to the Samaritan pronunciation. The prayerbook is available either as an editable <a href="http://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/The-Israelite-Samaritan-Weekday-Prayerbook-Uri-DeYoung_Modern.odt">Open Document</a> file, or as a <a href="http://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/The-Israelite-Samaritan-Weekday-Prayerbook-Uri-DeYoung_Modern.pdf">PDF</a> file.
