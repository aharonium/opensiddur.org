post_excerpt: |
  We pray for those of us
  Who are so angry
  That we have lost compassion for the suffering
  Of anyone who is not a member of our group.
  And we pray for those of us
  Who cannot see the suffering
  Behind the loss of that compassion.
  
  We pray for the strength
  To resist the urge to inhumanity
  That we feel in times of fear and mourning.
  We pray for the courage
  To resist the calls to inhumanity
  That others may make upon us in times of crisis.
