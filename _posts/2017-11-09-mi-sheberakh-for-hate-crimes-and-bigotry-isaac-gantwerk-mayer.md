  מי שברך למיני פשעי
  שנאה | Mi Sheberakh for Hate Crimes
  and Bigotry, by Isaac Gantwerk-Mayer
author: Isaac Gantwerk Mayer
post_excerpt: >
  From resurgent neo-fascist movements to
  religious extremist attacks, hate crimes
  are on the rise all over the world right
  now. At times like this many people live
  in fear – fear of being attacked or
  maligned, physical, mental or emotional.
  Hatred is not new to the Jewish people,
  but traditionally it was considered
  "just the way it is." As Americans, we
  should believe better. The midrash
  (Devarim Rabbah 5:10) says that hateful
  speech kills three – the speaker, the
  listener, and the subject. This Mi
  Sheberakh was written as a prayer for
  all those of every people and nation
  that are affected by hatred and bigotry.

when You will fulfill the vision of Your prophet and servant, 
as it is written [Isaiah 44:8]: “Do not be afraid, and do not be shaken! 
Have I not from of old been heard to you? 
I told, and you were my witnesses, so is there any god but me? 
There is no other Rock I know of!” 
May it be in this year, speedily, and close in time, 
and let us say amen!

From resurgent neo-fascist movements to religious extremist attacks, hate crimes are on the rise all over the world right now. At times like this many people live in fear – fear of being attacked or maligned, physical, mental or emotional. Hatred is not new to the Jewish people, but traditionally it was considered "just the way it is." As Americans, we should believe better. The midrash (Devarim Rabbah 5:10) says that hateful speech kills three – the speaker, the listener, and the subject. This Mi Sheberakh was written as a prayer for all those of every people and nation that are affected by hatred and bigotry.

Through use of repeated threefold lists (three traditionally being a number reflecting completeness), this prayer reflects the universal hope of peace and tranquility. Jerusalem, as a city whose very name is peace, yet that has experienced far too much war, serves as a microcosm of the world (a continuation of the Biblical idea of praying for the peace of Jerusalem – see Psalm 122:6).
