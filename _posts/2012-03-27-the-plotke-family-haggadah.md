<strong>Update</strong>: I have extensively edited this free Haggadah since last year (2012). New to this version are hundreds of corrections, the inclusion of only fonts which can be legally redistributed, and a wider layout intended for legal size paper.

A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chabad">Chabad</a> Haggadah, based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menachem_Mendel_Schneerson">Rebbe</a>’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haggadah_of_Pesach">Haggadah</a>, made for my family. I began work on this Haggadah many years ago, when there wasn’t this glut of Chabad Haggadahs that currently saturates the market. Still, I think this is a valuable contribution in that it provides the complete Hebrew text and translation for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_content">free</a>, in every sense of the word.

If you want to work on the Haggadah, you should first install the fonts, then open the ODT file in <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/">LibreOffice</a> [or OpenOffice, or even MS Word --ed.]. This is the only method (almost) certain to work.
