<strong>Update</strong>: I have extensively edited this free Haggadah since last year (2012). New to this version are hundreds of corrections, the inclusion of only fonts which can be legally redistributed, and a wider layout intended for legal size paper.

A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chabad">Chabad</a> Haggadah, based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menachem_Mendel_Schneerson">Rebbe</a>’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haggadah_of_Pesach">Haggadah</a>, made for my family. I began work on this Haggadah many years ago, when there wasn’t this glut of Chabad Haggadahs that currently saturates the market. Still, I think this is a valuable contribution in that it provides the complete Hebrew text and translation for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_content">free</a>, in every sense of the word.

If you want to work on the Haggadah, you should first install the fonts, then open the ODT file in <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/">LibreOffice</a> [or OpenOffice, or even MS Word --ed.]. This is the only method (almost) certain to work.

Michael adds, "Be aware, it is forbidden to use any electronic copy of this haggadah in violation of the strictures of any Jewish holiday. Consult a <a href="http://www.hebcal.com/">Jewish Calendar</a> if you are unsure when holidays fall out or what the rules are."
