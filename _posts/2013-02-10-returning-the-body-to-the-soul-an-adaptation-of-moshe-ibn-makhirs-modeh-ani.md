post_excerpt: |
  Last year around this time, I was sitting with Ya'qub ibn Yusuf in  his bookstore, <em><a href="http://www.olamqatan.com">Olam Qatan</a></em> (54 Emek Refaim in South Jerusalem), asking if he might share some useful practice that I might share through the Open Siddur Project. He offered this thought which he had heard from someone else: <blockquote>
  I have difficulty with the idea of thanking G!d for "returning my soul to me" <em>sheheḥezarta bi nishmati</em> while I'm still endeavoring to remain in touch with my dreams. So I much prefer what someone else suggested, that instead of saying <em>nishmati</em> (my soul), to say instead <em>han'shamati</em> (the embodiment of my soul). I thank G!d for returning me to my body -- my soul was never missing. </blockquote>

If you know its origin, please share in the comments.[/foot] He said,

<blockquote>
I have difficulty with the idea of thanking God for "returning my soul to me" <em>sheheḥezarta bi nishmati</em> when I’m getting up with an awareness of trying to stay in touch with my dreams. It’s not my soul that’s been missing through the night; I’m returning to experience my body. So I much prefer what I heard someone suggest, that instead of saying <em>nishmati</em> (my soul), to say instead <em>han'shamati</em> (the embodiment of my soul). I thank God for returning me to my body -- my soul was never missing! In the words of my Sufi teacher Murat Yagan, “I am a soul, and I have a body."</blockquote>

<em>Modeh Ani</em> first appeared as an addendum in <em>Seder ha-Yom</em> (1599) by Rav Moshe ibn Makhir of Tzfat. Translation is mine. Read more on Modeh Ani from Shmueli at <a href="https://hardcoremesorah.wordpress.com/2011/08/20/modeh-ani-i-give-thanks-before-you/">Hardcore Mesorah</a>.
