post_excerpt: |
  Remember the blessings of those who no longer walk this earth.
  
  Remember each name, each life-story.
  
  Remember on behalf of those whose memory fails.
  
  Remember with love the sweet and the bittersweet.
  
  Remember with forgiveness the hurt and misunderstanding.
  
  Remember with insight so you might experience deeper meaning.
  
  Remember through the pain until you can touch the joy and find comfort.
  
  Remember through dreams left unfulfilled and choose one to fulfill.
  
  Remember through your heart.
  
  Remember through your actions.
