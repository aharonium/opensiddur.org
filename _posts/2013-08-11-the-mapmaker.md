  Cold facts.<br />
  Colder realities.<br />
  The preacher who lost his way<br />
  The librarian who empties the shelves<br />
  The cook without a spoon<br />
  The child masking as a king<br />
  The king masking as a child.<br />
  The mapmaker studies them all<br />
  Furrowing his brow tightly<br />
  Crafting lines delicately.<br />
  Charges<br />
  Nothing<br />
  And<br />
  Changes<br />
  Everything

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Cold facts.
Colder realities.
The preacher who lost his way
The librarian who empties the shelves
The cook without a spoon
The child masking as a king
The king masking as a child.
The mapmaker studies them all
Furrowing his brow tightly
Crafting lines delicately.
Charges
Nothing
And
Changes
Everything</p>
