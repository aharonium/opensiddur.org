  Garlic is typically the last crop
  planted on a farm, it is planted in the
  fall and harvested the following summer.
  So you are leaving a legacy for next
  years farmers (which might be you). We
  begin by separating the garlic bulbs
  from the cloves, similar to separating
  people from their community. Then, once
  the individual (garlic cloves) are
  planted, they form new communities in
  the ground. Similar to the process that
  we are all going through. Leaving our
  community here on the farm and going out
  into the world to create new
  communities.

Jewish farming has increasingly engaged intentional communities of Jewish farmers, farmer-educators, and environmental educators. This is exemplified in the experience of Jewish farmers at Isabella Freedman Retreat Center (the Adamah Fellowship), at Urban Adamah (in Berkeley, California), and at Eden Village Camp (in Putnam Valley, New York). These farmers have gone on to teach and grow what they've learned, the Torah of the Earth, in new communities and new farms, some of which they've founded. The pictures here are from the 2015 ADVA Reunion, a gathering of former Adamah Fellows and TEVA Learning Center educators.
