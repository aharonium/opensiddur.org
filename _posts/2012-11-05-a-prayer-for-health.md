  A Prayer for Health in Work by Rabbi
  Menachem Creditor
author: Menachem Creditor
post_excerpt: |
  God, may my work feel redemptive even when an ocean of need feels like it will pull me down.
  May I feel the supported when I feel alone in my work.
  O God, remind me when I fail that I can learn, and that my life is more than my work.
  O God, remind me when I succeed that I can learn, and that deep success requires the efforts of many.
  May I remember that going home is a crucial part of the dream.
  God, help me to remember that I am one of the people I am called by You to serve.
  May I feel undivided as I transition from sphere to sphere, a whole person within Your world.
