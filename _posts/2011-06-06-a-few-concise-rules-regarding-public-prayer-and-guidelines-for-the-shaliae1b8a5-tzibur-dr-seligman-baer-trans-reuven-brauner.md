  Rules of Etiquette for Public Prayer by
  Isaac Seligman Baer (1868)
author: Isaac Seligman Baer
post_excerpt: 'The impetus for writing this monograph came from a long-time observation that most worshipers and, by extension <em>Shalechei Tzibur</em> [prayer leaders], are either generally unaware of certain basic Laws regarding Public Prayer and Conduct in the Synagogue or simply lax in their proper observance. As such, I felt that there is a need to refresh in the minds of the general public certain fundamental regulations in these areas. I have chosen to translate the prefatory pages relating to these matters from the classic <em>Siddur Avodas Yisroel</em> by Dr. Seligmann Baer, published in Rödelheim in 1868. His summary is terse, yet comprehensive, and very closely aligned with the accepted <em>Halochoh</em>. Although, in those instances where there is a difference from commonly accepted practice and custom, I have tried to augment his text with instructions found in the popular <em>Siddur Tefilas Kol Peh</em> (TKP, Shaliach Tzibur edition, published by Eshkol, Jerusalem, and which was prepared in accordance with the <em>Mishne Berura</em>) and other sources.'

The impetus for writing this monograph came from a long-time observation that most worshipers and, by extension <em>Shalechei Tzibur</em> [prayer leaders], are either generally unaware of certain basic Laws regarding Public Prayer and Conduct in the Synagogue or simply lax in their proper observance. As such, I felt that there is a need to refresh in the minds of the general public certain fundamental regulations in these areas.

I have chosen to translate the prefatory pages relating to these matters from the classic <em>Siddur Avodas Yisroel</em> by Dr. Seligmann Baer, published in Rödelheim in 1868. His summary is terse, yet comprehensive, and very closely aligned with the accepted <em>Halochoh</em>.
