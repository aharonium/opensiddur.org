<strong>Intention for Ḥanukah Candle-Lighting</strong>

Holy One who blessed our People Israel with the foundation of a Jewish homeland in our time.

Privilege us to sanctify and fulfill our longing without further violence, conquest, or covetousness.

Strengthen us to comfort the mourners and help heal the injured.

May Israel be worthy to tend the land, to reap the harvest,
and nurture each other with dignity and respect for the earth and all inhabitants.

May we shed blood, our life fluid, only in monthly renewal and birth, in covenant, the cycle of life-giving.

May the olives grown and harvested in Israel lubricate collaboration among partners who struggle.

May we merit to use olive oil, juice of the fruit of peace, with honor and delight with one another.

May we kindle the flame of others and usher in a more redeemed state.

May our light "flow free and burn steady" during the dark hours in our hearts and minds, and in our world.
