post_excerpt: '"Does joy come in the morning, where weeping has not tarried for the night? Can we dance together, if we have not yet joined in lament?" This prayer is a kavanah for the morning blessings, using language and images from the prayer "Mah Tovu" [how lovely are your tents] commonly recited in the early morning blessings. Offered with special intention for the healing of Congress Heights, Capitol View, and other neighborhoods in Washington, DC, rocked by persistent violence.'
