  A Prayer for Justice, Blessing, and
  Praise on Shabbat Shoftim by Virginia
  Spatz
author: Virginia Spatz
post_excerpt: '"Does joy come in the morning, where weeping has not tarried for the night? Can we dance together, if we have not yet joined in lament?" This prayer is a kavanah for the morning blessings, using language and images from the prayer "Mah Tovu" [how lovely are your tents] commonly recited in the early morning blessings. Offered with special intention for the healing of Congress Heights, Capitol View, and other neighborhoods in Washington, DC, rocked by persistent violence.'

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">How lovely are these tents![foot]Numbers 24:5[/foot] </span>
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">not far from housing that has seen better days</span>
<span style="font-size: 14pt;"> and housing that has seen too many awful ones.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">I love the place of Your house, reached through streets</span>
<span style="font-size: 14pt;"> collecting cigarette butts, the odd chicken wing, echoes of homicide.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Through Your abundant love, I enter Your house,</span>
<span style="font-size: 14pt;"> where these peaceful walls remind us: “If I am for myself alone, what am I?”[foot]Hillel the Elder, Pirkei Avot 1:14[/foot] </span>
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">while a few miles away homes reel from gunshots and mourning,</span>
<span style="font-size: 14pt;"> makeshift memorials of teddy bears and candles pooled with tears and rain.</span>
<span style="font-size: 14pt;"> Meetings and vigils and “let this be the last.”</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">My prayer seeks a favorable time –</span>
<span style="font-size: 14pt;"> Does joy come in the morning, where weeping has not tarried for the night?</span>
<span style="font-size: 14pt;"> Can we dance together, if we have not yet joined in lament?</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">You answer with your saving truth:</span>
<span style="font-size: 14pt;"> Your glory's dwelling-place spans mountain top and pit.</span>
<span style="font-size: 14pt;"> We are shaken and we stand firm.</span>
<span style="font-size: 14pt;"> Remove our sackcloth and dress us to praise You, Source of Healing and Help.</span>

This prayer is a kavanah for the morning blessings, using language and images from the prayer "Mah Tovu" [how lovely are your tents], commonly recited in the early morning blessings, and Psalms 30. Offered with special intention for the healing of Congress Heights, Capitol View, and other neighborhoods in Washington, DC, rocked by persistent violence.
