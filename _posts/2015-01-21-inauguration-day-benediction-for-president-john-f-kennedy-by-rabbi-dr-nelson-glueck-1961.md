<div class="english">
We turn to Thee, O God, in deepest gratitude on this exalting day of reaffirmation of our Nation's ideals and unity, and of personal avowal of sacred obligation by our President, in Thy name.

Mayest Thou, O God, to whom alone belong the dominion and the power, be his stay and support in the fulfillment of his awesome trust, to insure the unfettered implementation of the spirit and letter of our Constitution for all the inhabitants of our land, to provide them in law and in fact equal opportunities of learning and labor and well-being, to safeguard the physical and moral integrity of our beloved Commonwealth, founded on faith in Thee.

O Thou, who art the source of all life, quicken his heart always with the awareness of Thy presence, and especially in the lonely moments of fateful decisions which may be his to make for us and our world.

Guard and guide him in Thy loving kindness, that through his leadership hunger may be stilled, hurts healed, hope sustained, the weak and the worn assisted, human dignity and decency up-held, the blight of war and the specter of annihilation banished, and peace in freedom prevail among all Thy children everywhere, with none to make them afraid.

In profound humility, O God, we pray that Thy blessing may rest upon our President and all associated with him in our Government, which we the people have set in authority, upon everyone and everything dear and precious to him and us, as we repeat the ever new words of the ancient prayer in sacred writ:
