  חד גדיא | Ḥad Gadya (ca. 1526
  CE)
post_name: had-gadya

post_excerpt: "Making sense of Ḥad Gadya beyond its explicit meaning has long inspired commentary. For me, Ḥad Gadya expresses in its own beautiful and macabre way a particularly important idea in Judaism that has become obscure if not esoteric. While an animal's life may today be purchased, ultimately, the forces of exploitation, predation, and destruction that dominate our world will be overturned. Singing Ḥad Gadya is thus particularly apropos for the night of Passover since, in the Jewish calendar, this one night, <em>different from all other nights</em>, is considered the most dangerous night of the year -- it is the time in which the forces of darkness in the world are strongest. Why? It is on this night that the divine aspect of Mashḥit, the executioner, is explicitly invoked (albeit, only in the context of the divine acting as midwife and guardian/protector of her people), as explained in the <em>midrash</em> for Exodus 12:12"

Ḥad Gadya here is sung by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr4LSdALxpI">Moishe Oysher with the Abraham Nadel Chorus</a> (circa 1955?), in Aramaic and Hebrew. This stop-motion animation was created by Nina Paley (animator, director) with the help of Theodore Gray (stitchcoder, embroiderer) and Nick Mann (lights, camera). This short film is part of a larger project, <a href="http://sedermasochism.com">Seder Masochism</a>, Nina's animated retelling of the story of the exodus. Over on vimeo, Nina Paley writes:

<blockquote>Our most ridiculously labor-intensive animation ever! The traditional Passover folk song rendered in embroidermation by Nina Paley and Theodore Gray.
These very same embroidered matzoh covers are available for purchase here: <a href="http://palegraylabs.com/chad-gadya/">palegraylabs.com/chad-gadya/</a></blockquote>

Making sense of Ḥad Gadya beyond its explicit meaning has long inspired commentary. For me, Ḥad Gadya expresses in its own terrifying and macabre way a particularly important idea in Judaism that has become obscure if not esoteric. While an animal's life may today be purchased, ultimately, the forces of exploitation, predation, and destruction that dominate our world will be overturned and a new age will dawn. Singing Ḥad Gadya is thus particularly apropos for the night of Passover since, in the Jewish calendar, this one night, <em>different from all other nights</em>, is considered the most dangerous night of the year -- it is the time in which the forces of darkness in the world are strongest. Why? It is on this night that the divine aspect of <em>mashḥit</em>, the executioner, is explicitly invoked, as explained in the <em>midrash</em> for Exodus 12:12 read in the <em>maggid</em> section of the Haggadah for Passover:

In Jewish belief, there is one and only one divine concept that is responsible for light and dark, suffering and joy. The invocation of the most dangerous and harmful aspect is limited to the one day dedicated to telling of the birth of the people and in which the divine acts as midwife and guardian/protector of her people. This aspect, however, is destructive, and so is related to predation, the <em>yetzer hara</em> <a href="http://ejmmm2007.blogspot.com/2006/12/necessary-evil-yetzer-ha-ra.html">as described in Yoma 69b</a>, a crucial mechanism by which the nature of our world, <em>Olam Hazeh</em>, is sustained. The significance of our founding as a people, however, is to study the Torah so as to circumscribe our predatory inclination with kindness and consideration, ethics and laws, so as to realize what Isaiah articulated in his vision -- "They will neither harm nor destroy on all my holy mountain, for the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the YHVH as the waters cover the sea."[foot]Isaiah 11:9[/foot] Our world may be a bloody nightmare sustained through violent predation, but we hope for a new age in which the divinity suffusing all of creation is apparent to all and that even nature itself may be sustained in peace, kindness, and consideration.</blockquote>
