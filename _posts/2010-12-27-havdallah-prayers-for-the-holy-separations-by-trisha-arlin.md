<strong>HAVDALLAH:  Prayers for the Holy Separations</strong>[foot]Originally written for Yom Kippur Havdallah, 5771 [September 18, 2010]. Three short havdallah <em>divrei tefillah</em> that culminate in a havdallah prayer/blessing.[/foot]
by <a href="http://triganza.blogspot.com">Trisha Arlin</a>[foot]Trisha Arlin is a writer/performer and a student of Torah and prayer.  She received a BA in Theater from Antioch College in 1975 and a MFA in Film (Screenwriting) in 1997 from Columbia University School of the Arts.  Trisha works as a freelance writer and editor. In 1997, Trisha joined <a href="http://kolotchayeinu.org">Kolot Chayeinu</a>/<a href="http://kolotchayeinu.org">Voices of our Lives</a>, a progressive unaffiliated congregation in Brooklyn NY, where she recently shared a cycle of High Holyday prayers. She edits their journal, <a href="http://kolotchayeinu.org/Our_Voices">VOICES</a>.  From 2003 to 2005, she wrote and performed her one-woman show, THINGS I HAVE BELIEVED IN, directed by Arthur Strimling.  In 2009/2010, Trisha was an Arts Fellow at the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20131118114316/http://www.drisha.org:80/artsfellows09-10.php">Drisha Institute</a>.  Trisha now writes and performs her <em>divrei tefillah</em>, words of prayer. This year she became a member of the sixth cohort of the <a href="http://www.davvenenleadership.com/">Davennen Leadership Training Institute</a> (DLTI), studying prayer leadership with Rabbi Marcia Prager and Rabbi Shawn Zevit.  Trisha also teaches a workshop, Story On Fire, that teaches participants how to pull out the verbal and physical essence of a parsha, prayer or drash in order to present it to an audience or Kehillah.  Her essay, We Eat First, co-written with Rabbi Ellen Lippmann, has just been published in the book, The sacred Table, CCAR Press.  Trisha Arlin blogs at triganza.blogspot.com where many of her other prayers and divrei torah can be seen.[/foot]

I.
Praise the Before
Praise the After
Praise the Time In Between

Praise <em>Kadosh</em>, the holy
Praise <em>Khol</em>, the mundane
Praise <em>Ha Mavdil Bein Kodesh L’khol</em>, the one who differentiates between them

Praise <em>Kabbalah</em>, welcome the Bride
Praise <em>Shabbat</em>, the deepest rest.
Praise <em>Havdallah</em>, farewell to the departing soul

II.
I construct four walls and a roof and no windows
I put in only one door, open it once a year, and never go in.
Inside the walls, Holy of Holies
Outside the walls, everything else.
All I did was build a temple.

I buy some fabric.
I put fringes on the corners and cover myself with the cloth.
Inside the cloth, I am “kadosh” and I can pray.
Outside the cloth, I am “khol” and I gossip.
But all I did was cover myself with a piece of fabric.

I have a rimless cap.
I put it on my head and call it a <em>kippah</em>.
Inside my kippah, I’m alone but in conversation with God and my <em>kehillah</em>.
Outside my kippah, I’m by myself
All I did was put on a cap.

I have a candle, wine, and sweet smelling spices
I light the candle and dip it in the wine, I smell the spices and call it <em>havdallah</em>.
Before sunset, guilt and sin and begging for forgiveness
After sundown, onto a year of new mistakes and hope.
All I did was wait for it to get dark.

I make a flimsy hut with branches overhead and fruit within.
I call it a <em>sukkah</em> and sit down for a meal.
From inside the hut, I see three stars appear.
Outside the hut, I see the same three stars.
Inside outside, same thing?
All I did was build a hut.

III.
Wine
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Growth, harvest, creation, sexuality, body, love.
Purged of guilt, at least until tomorrow</p>
Spice
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Sweetness, Fragrance, art, luxury, flavor, comedy.
It is good to live well if you can.</p>
Fire
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Sacrifice, spirit, usefulness, justice, inspiration
Clear thinking at last and the work begins.</p>
IV.
Blessed Was•Is•Will Be, that brings the harvest in its due time,
And wine to drink, fire to light our way and spices to make us happy

Blessed <em>HaMavdeel</em>, that which Divides,
And separates the whole into increments that we may comprehend it.

Blessed <em>Echad</em>, that which Unites,
And connects us all that we may be one.

Amen.
