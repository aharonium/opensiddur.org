  Exalted are you Lincoln. Who is like you!
  You were highly respected among Kings and Princes.
  All that you accomplished you did with a humble spirit.
  You are singular and cannot be compared to anyone else.
  Who among the great are like Lincoln? Who can be praised like you?

You have earned a name among the Great.

Your right hand exhibited its prowess.

Against your enemies, you extended a sword of death;

Your bow you directed night and day.

You declared that Our Father in Heaven created all men equally.

Therefore you and you followers fought for freedom in your land.

Through your efforts the <em>Kushim</em>[foot]<em>The Jewish Messenger</em> translates the Kushim (<span class="hebrew">הכושים</span>) as "the blacks." Abe Katz translates to "African Americans." We have kept the original.[--Aharon Varady][/foot] were led to freedom.

They will praise and bless your name forever.

Who among princes is equal to you, Lincoln, and who can be praised like you?[foot]The translation as it <a href="http://www.stevens-tech.edu/golem/llevine/history/lincoln_jews.pdf">originally appears</a> in The Jewish Messenger is as follows:

My heart overflows with a good speech. I address my work unto a king. Psalms, 45:2.[sic]

I.

Happy art thou, Lincoln, Who is like unto thee!
Among kings and princes thou art exalted.
Much thou did'st with an humble spirit.
Thou art like a unique person in the land.
Who among princes is like Lincoln?
Who shall be praised like him?

II.
Thou hast also a name among heroes!
Thy right hand has achieved prowess against them.
Thou hast girded on the sword of the slain.
Thou hast drawn the bow by night and by day.
One Father has created us, thou hast said;
Therefore thou hast proclaimed Freedom in thy land.
The black people thou hast redeemed into Freedom:
Forever they will praise and bless thy name.[/foot]
