  We lift Miriam’s cup,
  Dancing prophet celebrating the world that is now.
  And we tell God we are grateful
  For the water from the earth that was Miriam’s gift,
  Welcome necessity,
  On God’s behalf.
  Miriam announces joy!
  And teaches us to save ourselves.
  Miriam, the bringer of mercy,
  There’s no prayer for her in the <em>haggadah</em>--
  So make one up!

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A <em>Kavannah</em> and Prayer</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">What was the <em>seder</em> table when we only had Elijah’s cup? Incomplete.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We open the door for Elijah,
Angry prophet of the world to come.
And we ask God to pay attention
To the fire from the sky that was Elijah’s gift.
Regretted necessity.
Elijah announces the Moshiaḥ
Who then saves the Jews!
Elijah, the bringer of justice.
When you open the door don’t just say the prayer
Read the translation,
It’s a little scary
So invite that in.
Bring down the anger, bring down the plagues
Sometimes we need them,
It’s part of the story.
We were slaves in Egypt and it was horrible.
But
If there is a child at the table
Let her open the door for Uncle Elijah
And hope that there’s some wind tonight
And when it blows
Tell her that’s Elijah as he comes inside
Visiting each Jewish home on Pesaḥ
To have his cup of wine.
And when the child sits back down
Jiggle the table just a little
And tell her to watch the wine shake in the cup
So the kid thinks Elijah is there, taking a sip.
The anger will wait.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We lift Miriam’s cup,
Dancing prophet celebrating the world that is now.
And we tell God we are grateful
For the water from the earth that was Miriam’s gift,
Welcome necessity,
On God’s behalf.
Miriam announces joy!
And teaches us to save ourselves.
Miriam, the bringer of mercy,
There’s no prayer for her in the <em>haggadah</em>--
So make one up!
It’s a little scary
But what the heck.
Bring up the water, start the party
Sometimes we need it
And it’s part of the story:
We were slaves in Egypt and now we are free.
But
If there is a child at the table
Let him take a sip from Miriam’s cup,
If all the talking makes him thirsty,
And while he drinks
Tell him about Miriam the artist
Singing <em>Mi Ḳhamoḳhah</em> on the Red Sea Shore
Making sure we have fun at the table.
And when the child is finished
Remember that Miriam was a truth teller
And for that the prophet paid a heavy price
Make sure the kid respects Miriam, and values her water.
The fun will wait.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">So together on the seder table
Fire and Water, Justice and Mercy
<em>Tzedek v’ Raḥameem</em>,
The cup of wine to stir the flame
The cup of water to quench it.
Only with both cups are we complete.
So for all this,
<em>Baruḳh Atah Adonai, Bruḳha At Sheḥinah</em>
Elijah and Miriam
We are blessed this Pesaḥ night.
Amen.</p>
