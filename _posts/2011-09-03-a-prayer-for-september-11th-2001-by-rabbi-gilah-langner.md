post_excerpt: |
  <em>Avinu she-ba-shamayim</em>, our Parent in heaven,
  <em>v’Ruaḥ kol basar</em>, the Spirit of all that lives,
  We turn toward You as we recall today with sorrow and honor
  those who lost their lives ten years ago, and those who gave their lives
  -– as passengers, firemen, and rescuers –- so that others might live.
  Grant their souls continuing rest in the shelter of eternity.
  And grant to us peace and fortitude in the years ahead,
  that we may restore a sense of trust and security to this great land,
  that we may be guided not by fear or terror,
  but by strength and understanding, holding fast to our ideals
  and upholding our highest values.
  Guard our comings and our goings in peace, now and always, <em>Amen</em>.
