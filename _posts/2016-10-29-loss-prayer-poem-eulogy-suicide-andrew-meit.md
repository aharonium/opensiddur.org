<div class="english">
For Ben, a bright soul

<strong>Loss of what could be; but is.</strong>
<em>(loosely based on the poem "Praying for what is lost" by Rabbi David Wolpe)</em>

Ein Sof:

How can I seek comfort 
for a potentiality lost? 
Or is it?

I cannot pray for deliverance 
from their choice for peace, 
only to be given memories 
filled with their miracles.

For what could be, now not
is burned into my soul, my time.

A child’s gift giftless;
A child grown parentless.
Long bereaved we living must.
Memories past are prayers cherished.

Only constant constructed love daily
lives out the powerful promise
to wrestle evil and wield goodness;
to prevent pain and helpless hope —

Let faith shine through crushing clouds;
let not tragedy engulf tenderness growing.

There is no victim,
There is no victimizer;
There is only the sustaining potential 
to keep trust in the potential to love.
</div>
