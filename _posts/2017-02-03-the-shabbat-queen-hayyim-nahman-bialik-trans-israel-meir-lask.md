  This translation of Ḥayyim Naḥman Bialik’s Shabbat Ha-Malkah by Israel Meir Lask can be found on pages 280-281 in the  <a href="https://archive.org/stream/SabbathPrayerBookJewishReconstructionistFoundation1945/Sabbath%20Prayer%20Book%20%28Jewish%20Reconstructionist%20Foundation%2C%201945%29#page/n312/mode/2up">Sabbath Prayer Book</a> (Jewish Reconstructionist Foundation, 1945) where it appears as “Greeting to Queen Sabbath.” The poem is based on the shabbat song, Shalom Aleikhem and first published in the poetry collection, Hazamir, in 1903. [I have made a faithful transcription of the Hebrew and its English translation as it appears in this siddur. –Aharon N. Varady]
