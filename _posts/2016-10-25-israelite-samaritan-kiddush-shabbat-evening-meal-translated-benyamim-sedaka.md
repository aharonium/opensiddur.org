<h3>Poem To be read on Friday evening, before the Sabbath meal, by all those seated at the table</h3>
<em>by Abraham ben Marchiv Tsedaka Hassafari, 1852-1928</em>
 
Our Eloowwem,
You shared Your charity among those You have created
And with Your permission You gave unto us
From the food and the drink
Your Might, with its favour and holiness and benefit.
They are temporal, the food and the drink
Good for the sanctification of our souls
And for the purity of our hearts and souls.
From the varieties of breads and meats
From the plants and the grains
From the splendid vegetables and the dry food, from the pure refreshing drinks
From the blood of the grapes that adorn the table:
To every person his due
To prevent the loss of our souls.
As You said in your Book:
His praise will neither sleep, nor be withdrawn.
His words: Man does not live by bread alone
But by everything that issues from the Mouth of Shehmaa does Man live.
And now with Your help and Your ability
At Your command
We are gathered and we have laid this table
And we baked and we cooked.
We hope with Your charity we will enjoy the food and the drinks
Because our healing is in Your Hands.
</div></td>

<h3>The Blessing on the Food</h3>
<em>(Then the eldest one at the dinner table will bless the others)</em>
 
Shehmaa our Eloowwem
You are blessed and there is no Eloowwem but the One
And praise to Him
And your Sabbaths are blessed by Eloowem.
Be blessed who has said (Genesis 1:31 – 2:3):
And Eloowwem saw all that He had made
And behold, it was very good.
And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.
Thus the heavens and the earth were completed
And all the host of them.
And on the sixth day Eloowwem completed the work that He had done.
And He rested on the seventh day from all the work that He had done.
And Eloowwem blessed the seventh day and sanctified it
Because on it He rested from all the work of creation
That He had done.
Be blessed who has said (Exodus 31:16-17):
And the Children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath
To observe the Sabbath throughout their generations
As a perpetual covenant.
It is a sign between Me and the Children of Israel forever.
For in six days Shehmaa made the heavens and the earth
But on the seventh day He ceased from labour
And was refreshed.
Be blessed who has said (Deuteronomy 8:3, 10):
That man does not live by bread alone
But by every word that issues from the Mouth of Shehmaa man lives.
And when you have eaten and are satisfied
You will bless Shehmaa your Eloowwem for the good land that He has given you.
Shehmaa our Eloowwem, You are blessed
And there is no Eloowwem but the One
And the praise is to Him
And your Sabbaths are blessed by Eloowwem.
<em>(The reader will hold his glass of wine and say:)</em>
‘Happiness all your days for one hundred years’.  
<em>(Then the food may be eaten)</em>
