"Sandalphon" was written by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807 – 1882) and completed January 18, 1858, and first published in <em>Birds of Passage</em> (1858), section "Flight the First," page 62. As an introduction, Longfellow writes: 

<blockquote>November 2, 1857. In the evening, Scherb[foot]Emmanuel Vitalis Scherb, a German-speaking poet and critic from Basel, Switzerland, befriended by Longfellow.[/foot] read to me some curious Talmudic legends from Corrodi's <em>Chiliasmus</em>,[foot]This would be <a href="http://archive.org/stream/kritischegeschi01corrgoog#page/n404/mode/2up"><em>Kritische Geschichte des Chiliasmus</em></a> (1781, p. 336) by Heinrich Corrodi (1752-1793), professor of ethics at the Gymnasium in Zurich.

<strong>Sandalphon</strong>

Have you read in the Talmud of old,
In the Legends the Rabbins have told
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the limitless realms of the air,--
Have you read it,--the marvellous story
Of Sandalphon, the Angel of Glory,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandalphon, the Angel of Prayer? 

How, erect, at the outermost gates
Of the City Celestial he waits,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his feet on the ladder of light,
That, crowded with angels unnumbered,
By Jacob was seen, as he slumbered
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone in the desert at night? 

The Angels of Wind and of Fire
Chant only one hymn, and expire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the song's irresistible stress;
Expire in their rapture and wonder,
As harp-strings are broken asunder
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By music they throb to express. 

But serene in the rapturous throng,
Unmoved by the rush of the song,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With eyes unimpassioned and slow,
Among the dead angels, the deathless
Sandalphon stands listening breathless
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sounds that ascend from below;-- 

From the spirits on earth that adore,
From the souls that entreat and implore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fervor and passion of prayer;
From the hearts that are broken with losses,
And weary with dragging the crosses
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too heavy for mortals to bear. 

And he gathers the prayers as he stands,
And they change into flowers in his hands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into garlands of purple and red;
And beneath the great arch of the portal,
Through the streets of the City Immortal
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is wafted the fragrance they shed. 

It is but a legend, I know,--
A fable, a phantom, a show,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the ancient Rabbinical lore;
Yet the old mediaeval tradition,
The beautiful, strange superstition,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But haunts me and holds me the more. 

When I look from my window at night,
And the welkin above is all white,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All throbbing and panting with stars,
Among them majestic is standing
Sandalphon the angel, expanding
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His pinions in nebulous bars. 

And the legend, I feel, is a part
Of the hunger and thirst of the heart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frenzy and fire of the brain,
That grasps at the fruitage forbidden,
The golden pomegranates of Eden,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To quiet its fever and pain.
