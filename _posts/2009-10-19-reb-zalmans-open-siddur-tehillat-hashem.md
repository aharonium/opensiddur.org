post_excerpt: |
  If you are not used to reading Hebrew with comprehension and with the ability to dilate the Hebrew from the literal meaning, or if you cannot read Hebrew and need a resource for daily davvenen, I offer you this set of texts, which I, too, use frequently for myself.
  
  I translated the Psalms and the liturgy in the way in which I experience them in my <strong>feeling consciousness</strong>. This does not offer the 'pshat', the literal meaning of the words, but the devotional interpretation that can make it a prayer of the heart.
