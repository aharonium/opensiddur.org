  על חטא | Al Ḥayt by Stew Albert
  and Judy Gumbo
author: Judy Gumbo
post_excerpt: |
  <em>We have sinned</em>
  By yielding to confusion and falling into passivity
  By indulging in fear
  By giving in to anger
  By not standing up for ourselves
  By thinking about Jewish values only on holy days
  By tolerating global warming, global disease and global poverty
  By being cynical about repairing the world
  By not defending Israel
  By not defending Palestine
  
  <em>For all our sins, may the force that makes forgiveness possible,
  forgive us, pardon us and grant us atonement</em>

By not standing up to fanaticism, terrorism, rape and torture – no matter who the perpetrators are

By not opposing laws that promise false security and deprive us of our freedoms and civil liberties
By not opposing ballot measures that deprive us of basic rights
