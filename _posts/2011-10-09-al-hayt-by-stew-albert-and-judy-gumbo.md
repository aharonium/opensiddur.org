  <em>We have sinned</em>
  By yielding to confusion and falling into passivity
  By indulging in fear
  By giving in to anger
  By not standing up for ourselves
  By thinking about Jewish values only on holy days
  By tolerating global warming, global disease and global poverty
  By being cynical about repairing the world
  By not defending Israel
  By not defending Palestine
  
  <em>For all our sins, may the force that makes forgiveness possible,
  forgive us, pardon us and grant us atonement</em>

<em>We have sinned</em>
By yielding to confusion and falling into passivity
By indulging in fear
By giving in to anger
By not standing up for ourselves
By thinking about Jewish values only on holy days
By tolerating global warming, global disease and global poverty
By being cynical about repairing the world
By not defending Israel
By not defending Palestine

<em>For all our sins, may the force that makes forgiveness possible, 
forgive us, pardon us and grant us atonement</em>

By not standing up to fanaticism, terrorism, rape and torture – no matter who the perpetrators are
By not rocking the boat
By not being grateful for our blessings
By not loving enough
By being indifferent to the rich getting richer and the poor staying miserable
By allowing greed, in others and in ourselves, to go unchecked
By not opposing laws that promise false security and deprive us of our freedoms and civil liberties
By not opposing ballot measures that deprive us of basic rights

<em>For all our sins, may the force that makes forgiveness possible, 
forgive us, pardon us and grant us atonement</em>

By building fences on our borders
By not actively opposing war and invasion of sovereign nations
By being paralyzed by paranoia and hatred
By living in the past and the future but not in the present
By forgetting that we are co-creators of the Universe
By not visiting the sick and the dying
By not making the most of the limited time we have
By speaking <em>loshen hara</em>[foot]Misrepresenting, harmful speech[/foot]
By forgetting how to smile

<em>For all our sins, may the force that makes forgiveness possible,
forgive us, pardon us and grant us atonement</em>

By hiding from our wrongdoings
By putting a stumbling block before the blind
By not searching for the truth, wherever it lies
By not recognizing the divine spark that dwells at the center of our being
By not forgiving and asking God for forgiveness

<em>For all our sins, may the force that makes forgiveness possible,
forgive us, pardon us and grant us atonement</em>
