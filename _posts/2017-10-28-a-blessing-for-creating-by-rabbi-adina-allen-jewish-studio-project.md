  ברכת יוצר יצירים | A
  Blessing for Creating, by Rabbi Adina
  Allen (Jewish Studio Project)
author: Adina Allen
post_excerpt: |
  "A Blessing for Creating" comes by way of David A.M. Wilensky (with approval by the blessing's author, Rabbi Adina Allen) who shared a photo on Facebook of a posterboard <a href="https://www.facebook.com/davidamwilensky/posts/10156770736904863">on which the blessing was written</a>. The poster was made for the first ever Kabbalat Shabbat organized by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/jewishstudioproject/about/">the Jewish Studio Project</a>, whose mission is "to activate creativity in individuals and communities to reclaim Jewish values, make meaning in our lives and restore hope to the world." Vocalization added by Aharon Varady.
