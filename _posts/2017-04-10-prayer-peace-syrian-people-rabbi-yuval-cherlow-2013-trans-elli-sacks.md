post_excerpt: |
  This prayer for the peace of the Syrian people was composed in 2013 by Rabbi Yuval Cherlow and translated by Elli Sacks of Modi’in. Our Hebrew source of the text was first published in this <a href="http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4423488,00.html">YNet article</a>. Our source for Elli Sacks's translation is <a href="https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2013/08/29/rav-yuval-cherlow-composes-prayer-for-the-situation-in-syria/">this post</a> in Alan Brill's blog. Rabbi Cherlow suggests that Psalms 37 and Psalms 120 are particularly appropriate for praying for peace in Syria. Both psalms speak of the plight of the innocent righteous when evil men plot against them. Thank you to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency for informing us of this prayer, and to YNet, and Alan Brill for providing the source text.
