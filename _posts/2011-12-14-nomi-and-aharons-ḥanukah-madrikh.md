post_excerpt: "Nomi Lerman and I were co-teacher's this past season at Kolot Ḥayeinu's religious school in Park Slope Brooklyn this past season, and as a Ḥanukah present we made a <em>Ḥanukah Madrikh</em> for our Kittah Gimmel class. I'm certain there are Jewish educators all over the world preparing curricular resources for Ḥanukah right about now and hope that by sharing this they can take it and improve on it, or else we'll save them some energy so they'll be able to do even more mitzvot."
