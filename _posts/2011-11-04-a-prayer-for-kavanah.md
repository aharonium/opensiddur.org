post_excerpt: >
  Hashem, as I open my Siddur, let me pray
  with proper kavanah. Let me pray with
  sincerity, paying careful attention to
  every word I utter. Hashem, let me
  concentrate with my whole being on the
  meaning of each and every word, sentence
  and prayer. Keep my mind from wandering
  to other subjects, and keep me from
  neglecting to put my heart and soul in
  to each and every prayer, praise and
  blessing. May my prayer come before You,
  O Hashem, at a time of grace, and may it
  be accepted favorably by You. Amen.
