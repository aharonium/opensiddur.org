  Culture hacking either respects
  copyright or ignores it. One of the
  pillars of the Open Siddur is its
  respect of copyright and its attempt to
  make available a digitized repository of
  Siddur content that is available for
  editing, mashups, and remixing, i.e.,
  "derivative works" that may be
  redistributed without restriction. For
  example, we want you to have the freedom
  to take the nusaḥ Ashkenaz, borrow
  kavanot from the nusaḥ sfard, and
  piyyutim (liturgical poetry) from the
  nusaḥ Romaniote; add and edit existing
  translations of familiar psalms and
  contribute and share your own
  translation of obscure piyyutim; share
  the pdf you build at Open Siddur and
  give it to an artist to apply an even
  more beautiful layout than the one we
  provide; and even redistribute the
  siddur commercially.
