W00t! First post!

Over the course of the summer I will be in Jerusalem attending the <a href="http://www.presentense.org/">PresenTense Institute</a>'s <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160331171421/http://presentense.org/institute/about">summer workshop</a>. Before I arrived I set in mind an intention, (or <em>kavanah</em>, as it were) to achieve the following goals:
<ol>
	<li>gaining expert understanding of the licensing and technical challenges for developing partnerships between creative projects founded on works in the public domain</li>
	<li> learning about how to manage and sustain non-commercial open source projects, and</li>
	<li>cultivating relationships with future partners and users of the Open Siddur and its affiliate projects.</li>
</ol>
