<h3>UPDATE APRIL 2013: SECOND-PASS PROOFREAD COMPLETE!</h3>

We've transcribed and proofread <a href="http://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Stunden_der_Andacht">our first collection of Jewish prayers</a>!

<hr />

If you can read German, we need your help.

We've transcribed Fanny Neuda's <em>Stunden Der Andacht</em>, an important Jewish women's book of prayers (<em>tkhines</em>) first published in 1855, and we need proofreaders who can read German, and who can read German in the gothic Fraktur script, to help proofread our transcription.

This project began on September 2011 when <a href="http://www.sprachkasse.de/blog/2011/09/04/stunden-der-andacht/">Chajm Guski</a> helped me <a href="http://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Stunden_der_Andacht">upload a scan of an 1858 edition of <em>Stunden Der Andacht</em></a> to the German Wikisource site. We've had some help from the German Wikisource community, but we need more help from proofreaders in the Open Siddur community to complete the proofread.

Visit the <em>Stunder Der Andacht</em>'s <a href="http://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Index:Neuda-Stunden_der_Andacht-1858.pdf">index page for proofreaders</a> and you'll see page links marked green, yellow, or violet. All of those green pages are fully proofread. The yellow pages have been proofread once over and just need another pass. The violet pages need two sets of eyes to look them over and make any corrections if necessary.

We believe this is an important project. Fanny Neuda's <em>Stunden Der Andacht</em> is a work in the Public Domain. It's been republished with new translations but the original text has never been available in a freely-licensed digital edition. We'd like to make this text more accessible. We'd like to make the prayers in Fanny Neuda's <em>Stunden Der Andacht</em> accessible in a way that modern readers can easily incorporate them into siddurim for themselves or for their communities.

A grave problem with most publications of collections of Jewish women's prayers is that these editions are rarely digitized and often only published as translations distributed under an "All Rights Reserved" copyright, thereby restricting their use for many many years after their publication.[foot]In many countries including the United States and Israel, the term of copyright before a creative work enters the Public Domain is the lifetime of the author/translator/artist plus an additional seventy years. In the U.S., if a copyright is sold to a company or publisher of a work, the term of coypright is 95 years. See this article on Wikipedia, "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries%27_copyright_length">List of Countries' Copyright Lengths</a>" for detail on the copyright term for your country.[/foot] We're building a more direct channel for these prayer to find their way back into new siddurim and we need your help to do this.

Won't you help? If you can't read German yourself, please pass along this invitation to friends of yours who do. Thank you.
