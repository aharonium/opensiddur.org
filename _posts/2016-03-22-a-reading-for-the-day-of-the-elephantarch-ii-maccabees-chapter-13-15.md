  It is challenging to think of how to
  mark Nicanor Day, as it remains at a
  disadvantage, not only on years when it
  conflicts with Ta’anit Esther but on
  all years since it has no mitzvot. This
  is probably the main reason that, unlike
  Chanukah and Purim, it was lost to
  Jewish practice for more than a thousand
  years. Nevertheless, we do have its
  megillah, which has been translated into
  Hebrew and English. Perhaps, if we start
  reading chapters 13-15 of 2 Maccabees,
  even just to ourselves, on the 13 of
  Adar, we can begin to resurrect a
  holiday that was celebrated and
  instituted by Judah Maccabee and his
  followers over two millennia ago, and
  which they envisioned would continue
  throughout Jewish History. With the
  return of Jews to Israel and Jewish
  sovereignty to Jerusalem, I believe it
  is about time.
