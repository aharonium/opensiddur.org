  Prayer for Those Going to University
author: Isaac Gantwerk Mayer
post_excerpt: |
  A prayer for the safety and success of those leaving home to go off to college and university. When children go off to college, parents can feel worried about the future of their children. Empty-nest syndrome can set in and spiritual guidance is often needed. This prayer uses the idioms of Biblical and siddur language to create a text for parents who worry about their children's future as they head off on their own. It could be said 49 days after Tekufat Tammuz in the diaspora (August 28 or 29 after a leap year – approximately the time when college terms begin in the US) or on the first Saturday after Shmini Atzeret ba'aretz (approximately when college terms begin in Israel)

May it be Your will, Adonai our God and God of our ancestors, that You guard all the people Israel’s students who shall go to universities and houses of study, to yeshivas and to to schools in all four corners of the earth, a hundred and twenty-seven lands. Enlighten their hearts with Your Torah, and open their souls with Your lovingkindness. O Guardian of Israel, guard them on the way, and shepherd them while they reside there, and return them home, so that they fulfill the mitzvah of honoring their parents, as it is written in Your Torah, “Honor your father and your mother,”[foot]Deuteronomy 5:15[/foot] and also in the words of Your messenger the prophet: “And He will turn the hearts of the fathers upon the children, and the hearts of the children upon the fathers,”[foot]Malachi 3:23[/foot] And we say: amen.
