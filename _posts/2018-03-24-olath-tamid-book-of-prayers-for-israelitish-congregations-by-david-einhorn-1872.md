It reflected what is now called “classical Reform,” eliminating prayers for the restoration of Zion, mentions of the messiah, and bodily resurrection of the dead, while diminishing mentions of Jewish chosenness and the like.'

This is עלת תמיד <em>Olath Tamid</em> by Rev. Dr. David Einhorn (1809-1878), in its first English/Hebrew edition (1872), after its initial publication in three German/Hebrew editions (1856, enlarged 1858/1862). Rabbi Dr. Dalia Marx writes:

<blockquote>Rabbi David Einhorn’s prayer book <em>`Olat Tamid</em> (lit. the perpetual sacrifice)...first penned in Germany, served as the model for the Union Prayer Book,....the prayer book of the American Reform movement for almost eight decades. It reflected what is now called “classical Reform,” eliminating prayers for the restoration of Zion, mentions of the messiah, and bodily resurrection of the dead, while diminishing mentions of Jewish chosenness and the like.</blockquote>

<h3>PREFACE.</h3>

THE favorable reception which my Olath Tamid has met with, going through three editions, encourages me to issue it in English translation, with some emendations, suggested mainly by Dr. FELSENTHAL of Chicago.

May it contribute, in its new garb, to the edification of my English-speaking brethren in faith, and meet with as friendly a reception as was accorded it in the old!

Dr. D. Einhorn, July 1872
