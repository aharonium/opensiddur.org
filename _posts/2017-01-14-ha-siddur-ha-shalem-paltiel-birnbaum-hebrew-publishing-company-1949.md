<em>Ha-Siddur Ha-Shalem</em> (The [Complete] Daily Prayer Book), translated and arranged by Paltiel Birnbaum, was widely used in Orthodox and Conservative synagogues until the late 1980s and remains a favorite prayerbook for many who grew up using it. First published by the Hebrew Publishing Company in 1949 under their copyright, this siddur is in the Public Domain in the United States due to the lack of copyright renewal required for works published in the US between 1923 and 1963.

The Cantors Assembly of America had the segment of the siddur containing the Birkat Hamazon (Blessing after Eating the Meal) published by itself as the <em>benscher</em>, <em>Rabbotai Nevareḥ</em> (1954). The benscher included notes to the popular Ashkenazi tune of the birkat hamazon provided by Moshe Nathanson. This benscher is also in the Public Domain in the United States due to the lack of copyright renewal required for works published in the US between 1923 and 1963.

Making digital images of these works available is the first step in our process of making the entire prayerbook, both Hebrew liturgy and English translation, machine-readable (copy-pastable and searchable).
