  תפילה לבאסטאן | Prayer After
  the Bombing in Boston by Rabbi Rachel
  Barenblat
author: Rachel Barenblat
post_excerpt: >
  I wrote this a few days after the Boston
  Marathon bombing. It arose out of a
  meditation service which I led at my
  synagogue. The doors to our sanctuary
  were open, so we had the sounds of the
  nearby wetland in our ears, and I
  invited the meditators to join me in
  cultivating compassion and sending it
  toward Boston. The line "My heart is in
  the east and I am in the west" is
  adapted from the medieval Spanish poet
  Judah haLevi.

I wrote this a few days after the Boston Marathon bombing. It arose out of a meditation service which I led at my synagogue. The doors to our sanctuary were open, so we had the sounds of the nearby wetland in our ears, and I invited the meditators to join me in cultivating compassion and sending it toward Boston.

The line "My heart is in the east and I am in the west" is adapted from the medieval Spanish poet Judah haLevi.

Alternating stanzas of the poem are italicized to facilitate reading the poem as a responsive reading. Please feel free to use this however is meaningful to you, and to share it with others.

To those for whom it is meaningful, I wish a Shabbat shalom, a Shabbat of peace and healing.
