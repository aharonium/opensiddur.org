  תפילה לבאסטאן | Prayer After
  the Bombing in Boston by Rabbi Rachel

post_excerpt: >
  I wrote this a few days after the Boston
  Marathon bombing. It arose out of a
  meditation service which I led at my
  synagogue. The doors to our sanctuary
  were open, so we had the sounds of the
  nearby wetland in our ears, and I
  invited the meditators to join me in
  cultivating compassion and sending it
  toward Boston. The line "My heart is in
  the east and I am in the west" is
  adapted from the medieval Spanish poet
  Judah haLevi.

Plant your feet firmly on the ground, your head
held high as though by a string.

<em>Listen to the red-winged blackbirds, the spring frogs.
There is an aquifer in your heart: send a dipper down.</em>

What have you drawn forth? Send it
out of this room like waves of song.

<em>Float it around the Hairpin Turn, along
the old Mohawk Trail. Direct it toward the rising sun.</em>

Our hearts are in the east though we are in the west.
Blanket the wounded city with melody.

<em>Sing to the runners with aching hamstrings
to the bewildered families who lined the marathon route</em>

to the children who are trying to make sense
to the adults who are trying to make sense

<em>to the EMTs and policemen who ran
not away from the suffering, but into the fire</em>

sing to the grieving families, here and everywhere.
Inhale again, reach into your well:

<em>is there light even for the twisted soul of the bomber?
Now sing to yourself, sluice your own wounds.</em>

We are loved by an unending love.
Listen to the birds again, and remember.
