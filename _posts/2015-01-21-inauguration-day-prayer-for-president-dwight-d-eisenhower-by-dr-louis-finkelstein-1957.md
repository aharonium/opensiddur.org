<div class="english">
God of our fathers, grant Dwight David Eisenhower and Richard Milhous Nixon the blessings sought of Thee for all mankind by the saint Rab 16 centuries ago in Babylonia. Give them long life, life of peace, life of happiness, above all life which may prove a blessing to mankind. Do Thou fulfill in their days and in ours Thy promise to the prophets, that Thou wilt cause fear of Thee to enter the hearts of all Thy creatures, so that mankind may become one society, dedicated with a complete heart to performance of Thy will. May wickedness be silenced, may the rule of arrogance vanish, and Thou alone reign over all. Our Father and our King, may our time be ripe for Thine own intervention as of yore, to inspire us to obey Thee, that all mankind may Join us in Thy service, for their own sake, and for the sake of Thy holy name. Amen.
