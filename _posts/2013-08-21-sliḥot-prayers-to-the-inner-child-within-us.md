  For all the times that I've judged you, and you shut down.<br />
  For the times when I've cast eyes of displeasure on your creative and luminous works,<br />
  For the times when I secretly whisper nasty things about you, that I would never say out loud,<br />
  For the times when I've asphyxiated you, and you felt cut off from your sacred life force...

i wrote this, the night of <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selichot">Sliḥot</a></em>, the night of "Forgiveness", when ancient prayers for forgiveness are sung and each person asks humbly to be pardoned from any misguided actions we have partaken in.

In the cycle of the Jewish Calendar, this is the period just before the New Year, when we take account of our actions, and ask for forgiveness and grace, so that we might be granted the opportunities to remake ourselves and grow in more resonant ways with our deeper calling...

may it inspire...
