  לאומיים | Al Hanissim supplement
  for the Birkat Hamazon and Amidah on all
  Secular/National Days of Gratitude, by
  Aharon Varady
author: Aharon N. Varady (translation)
post_excerpt: "Opportunities to express gratitude on secular, nationalist days of thanksgiving demand acknowledgement of an almost unfathomably deep history of trauma -- not only the suffering and striving of my immigrant ancestors, but the sacrifice of all those who endured suffering dealt by their struggle to survive, and often failure to survive, the oppressions dealt by colonization, conquest, hegemony, natural disaster. Only the Earth (from which we, earthlings were born, <em>Bnei Adam</em> from <em>Adamah</em>) has witnessed the constancy of the violent deprivations we inflict upon each other. The privilege I've inherited from these sacrifices has come at a cost, and it must be honestly acknowledged, especially on secular/national days of thanksgiving, independence, and freedom.  I insert this prayer after <em>Al Hanissim</em> in the <em>Amidah</em> and in the <em>Birkat Hamazon</em> on national days of independence and thanksgiving."

This <em>al hanissim</em> prayer was written for insertion into the <em>Modim</em> (we are thankful) blessing of the weekday Amidah and of the <em><a href="http://opensiddur.org/fixed-prayers/birkat-hamazon/blessing-the-spirit-of-life-after-eating-and-feeling-satiated/">Birkat Hamazon</a></em> after the festive meal on any other secular/national day of Thanksgiving.

"I am YHVH, I make all, I stretch out the heavens alone, the Earth is spread out before me."[foot]Isaiah 44:24, pronounced, <em>roka ha'arets may-iti</em> (the earth is spread out before me), but written <em>roka ha'arets mi-iti</em> <span class="scribe">מי אתי</span>? (the earth is spread out. Who was with me?)[/foot]&nbsp;
I am the one who planted this Tree [of Life] in order that all the world should delight in it. 
And in it, I spread all (<em>kōl</em>). I called it "all" because all depend on it, all emanate from it, and all need it. 
To it they look, for it they wait, and from it, souls fly in joy.
 Alone was I when I made it. Let no angel rise above it and say, "I was before you."[foot]Each nation of the Earth has its respective angel called a Sar, literally "prince." Let no national pride or spirit assume predominance.[/foot]&nbsp;
I was also alone in the time when I spread out my Earth, in which I planted and rooted this Tree [of Life]. 
I made them rejoice together, and I rejoiced in them.[foot]Sefer HaBahir §22. Per §21, this exposition is from Rebbi Yoḥanan.[/foot]&nbsp;

As immigrants in a foreign land,
we saw ourselves 
as grasshoppers in the eyes of predatory overlords.[foot]Numbers 13:33. Seeing oneself as an underling should not validate excuses for conquest or privilege. By grasshoppers, the verse suggests that the <em>Bnei Anak</em>, the giant children of the <em>Nephilim</em>, see newcomers as fast food, i.e., easy pickings. The <em>Nephilim</em> first referenced in Genesis ch. 6, are the <em>bnei elohim</em> -- children of G‽D -- who descend to Earth, take what they wish, and with their children, introduce predation into nature. Thematically, the <em>Nephilim</em> and their children are archetypal of any group or person who makes themselves into an oppressive bigshot.[/foot]&nbsp;
However, "not by their own sword did they seize land and possess it, 
nor did their own arm save them."[foot]Psalms 44:4 (partial).[/foot]&nbsp;
Rather, "through your own hand, HaShem, were the nations driven out and planted in; 
you separated the peoples and spread them abroad."[foot]Psalms 44:3. My central point here is that a humanity that is not acting as a proper steward of the Earth (as the Garden of Hashem) cedes the role of "gardener" to G‽Δ who, as the one god of both suffering and joy, drives out, spreads, and plants humanity in a manner that might seem just as arbitrary and capricious to us as a human farmer ploughing and planting might seem to the wild creatures of the fields and forests.[/foot]&nbsp;
Consequently, the Earth screams silently
from the blood of humanity which it cannot help but soak up,[foot]from Genesis 4:10. Either the <em>dahm</em> (blood) of Kayin's brother Abel cries out from <em>Adamah</em> (the earth) or the <em>Adamah</em> itself cries out. HaShem loves the Earth, and the Earth is ever burdened with the sins that humans cannot bear -- and HaShem takes note.[/foot]&nbsp;
while we cry with gratitude
 for the bounty and sanctuary we have found in her.[foot]cf. Psalms 126. As we should, but we need to reciprocate for our gratefulness by taking responsibility for our actions and the errors of the generations who came before us that acted with callous ignorance and neglect of the systems supporting life on earth and the welfare of the creatures we share this world with.[/foot]

Opportunities to express gratitude on secular, nationalist days of thanksgiving demand acknowledgement of an almost unfathomably deep history of trauma -- not only the suffering and striving of my immigrant ancestors, but the sacrifice of all those who endured suffering dealt by their struggle to survive, and often failure to survive, the oppression dealt by colonization, conquest, hegemony, natural disaster, etc. Only the Earth (from which we, earthlings,  were born <em>Bnei Adam</em> from <em>Adamah</em>) has witnessed the constancy of the violent traumas we inflict upon each other. The privilege bequeathed to me from this suffering is inherited along with a responsibility to be aware at just what cost this privilege was attained. This must be honestly acknowledged, especially on secular/national days of thanksgiving, independence, and freedom.

This prayer places the Earth at the center of a relationship usually subverted by nationalist aspirations and chauvinist ethnic pride. I want moments like those enshrined by secular/national holidays to reaffirm my commitment to building a world with fairness and compassion for all living creatures, and for establishing a universal, human identity that makes this commitment its central project. Even if (or especially when) my life necessitates my settlement upon the historic lands of indigenous peoples and all those who came before me, the least I can do is honor and recognize this history, and respect this land as it sustains me and the communities I rely upon. There is no land on Earth that doesn't have such a history, and there is no person whose genealogy spanning thousands and millions of years isn't ultimately interwoven with the complications of the conquests and survival of their progenitors.

I wrote the prayer above in English and translated it into Hebrew. The latter was subsequently corrected thanks to Rabbi Simcha Daniel Burstyn at Kibbutz Lotan. I insert this prayer after <em>Al Hanissim</em> in the <em>Amidah</em> and in the <em>Birkat Hamazon</em> on national days of independence and thanksgiving. Although it is intentionally written with a diasporic and universalist frame of reference, I hope it may apply just as well for <em>Yom HaAtzmaut</em> in <em>Medinat Yisrael</em> as it does in the United States, Canada, and other countries on their special days. In 2015, I revised this prayer, adding several verses in order to better emphasize my key points. In 2016, I switched the order of the two sections and polished the Hebrew grammar with the help of Tom Pessah.
