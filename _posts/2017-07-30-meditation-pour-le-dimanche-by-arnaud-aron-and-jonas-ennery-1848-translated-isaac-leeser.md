  This is a faithful transcription of a teḥinah (supplicatory prayer) composed in parallel to the prayer for Sunday, following in the paraliturgical tradition of Yiddish tkhines, albeit written in French. (This particular paraliturgical prayer may be original or it may be based on an earlier work in German or Yiddish. Please <a href="http://opensiddur.org/contact/">contact us</a> or comment below if you can identify it.) The prayer was included by Rabbi Arnaud Aron and Jonas Ennery in their opus, <a href="https://archive.org/details/Jonas-Ennery-Prieres-Dun-Coeur-Israelite">אמרי לב <em>Prières d’un Coeur Israelite</em></a> published in 1848 by the Société Consistoriale de Bons Livres. In 1855, an abridged English translation of <em>Prières d’un Coeur Israelite</em> was authorized by Nathan Marcus Adler, chief rabbi of the British Empire and published as <a href="https://archive.org/details/HesterRothschildPrayersAndMeditations"><em>Prayers and Meditations</em></a>, translated by Hester Rothschild. In 1863, Isaac Leeser <a href="http://opensiddur.org/prayers-for/tkhines/imrei-lev-meditations-and-prayers-for-every-situation-and-occasion-in-life-1866/">published his own translation</a>. This is the first time that Leeser's translation and its source have been set next to each other. Commenting on Rothschild's translation, Leeser wrote:
