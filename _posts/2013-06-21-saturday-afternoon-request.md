  Help me to silence<br />
  my mind's aggravation alarm,<br />
  to quiet the voice which says<br />
  the to-do list matters,<br />
  to temporarily eschew<br />
  continuous partial attention.

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Help me to silence
my mind's aggravation alarm,
to quiet the voice which says
the to-do list matters,
to temporarily eschew
continuous partial attention.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Open me to long slow conversations
on the sunlit grass, to the beat
of the hand-drummers who accompany
the singing of psalms, to a boat
lazily drifting on the glassy surface
of my heart's own pond.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">You're waiting for me
like a lover, eager
to embrace me again.
Remind me: this is the way
back to Eden, the bloom
on the thirteen-petaled rose.</p>
