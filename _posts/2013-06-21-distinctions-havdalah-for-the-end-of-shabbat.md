  Wax drips from the braided candle.<br />
  Cinnamon tingles the nose<br />
  to keep us from fainting<br />
  as the extra soul departs.<br />
  Stop now. Notice this hinge<br />
  between Shabbat<br />
  and what's next.

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In the end we're like children:
we thrive on distinctions
between me and you, us and them.
Made in Your image
we separate light from darkness,
family from stranger, weekday
from that fleeting taste of Paradise.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Wax drips from the braided candle.
Cinnamon tingles the nose
to keep us from fainting
as the extra soul departs.
Stop now. Notice this hinge
between Shabbat
and what's next.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Plunge the candle into the wine
but don't cry: even without a flame
our light still shines. This
is our inheritance, better than rubies.
And now it's Saturday night, the cusp
of a new beginning, another day.
This week, may our hearts be whole.</p>
