<tr>
<td>
<p style="padding: 0pt 25pt 0pt 4pt;"><span class="font0">The (Grateful) Dead frequently took the stage without greeting and began such extensive set up that the uninitiated might assume that A) they were watching roadies or that B) the concert would consist of endless sound checks. Sometimes the final chords of one song flowed directly into the next; other times, stretches of equipment fiddling and/or improvisation separated songs.</span></p>
</td>
<td>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding: 0pt 0pt 0pt 3pt;"><span class="font0">Sanhedrin 2a:</span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 7pt; padding: 0pt 7pt 0pt 3pt;"><span class="font0">“...But how do we know that a congregation consists of not less than ten? It is written, how long shall I bear with this evil </span><span class="font0" style="font-style: italic;">'edah. </span><span class="font0">Excluding Joshua and Caleb, we have ten....” Bible verses appear without quotation marks, discussion seems always to be already in progress. Related points follow in places; apparently endless digressions separate other points in an argument or exposition.</span></p>
</td>
<td>
<p style="padding: 0pt 7pt 0pt 3pt;"><span class="font0">In some Jewish traditions, individuals participate in prayer largely on their own, expecting to join in unison prayer only for the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style: italic;">barchu, kaddish,</span><span class="font0"> repetition of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style: italic;">Amidah</span><span class="font0"> and a few other spots. A visitor unfamiliar with this worship style might find it hard to participate.</span></p>
</td>
<td>
<p style="padding: 0pt 6pt 0pt 3pt;"><span class="font0">If a prayer leader - or the person in the next seat -announces the service progression with care and someone regularly tells you “what page we're on,” is that a sufficient clue as to what others are doing and/or how you might experience anything in the service?</span></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p style="padding: 0pt 25pt 0pt 4pt;"><span class="font0">Long sound checks, tendency to drift into individual or collective equipment adjustment, and habit (at least in older days) of barely acknowledging the audience were not irrelevant to the band's purpose (cf. acid test history). The Dead interact with one another, relating to an audience without addressing music TO it.</span></p>
</td>
<td>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding: 0pt 18pt 0pt 3pt;"><span class="font0">Elements of style visible in San 2a above -weaving together of biblical sources, use of narrative Torah to explain a practicality, like the minimum size of a “congregation” - are not irrelevant to understanding either the Talmud or the passage from Numbers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding: 0pt 18pt 0pt 3pt;"><span class="font0">The ancient rabbis and the texts are in a conversation with one another, relating to future generations but not speaking TO us.</span></p>
</td>
<td>
<p style="padding: 0pt 7pt 0pt 3pt;"><span class="font0">Worship style is not irrelevant to how participants view what is happening in the service: With few exceptions - Humanist prayer, e.g. - the main siddur text is part of an ancient, on-going conversation between Jews and God, not written TO users.</span></p>
</td>
<td>
<p style="padding: 0pt 6pt 0pt 3pt;"><span class="font0">How do we - as individuals and as a congregation - view the service? How much is internally directed? focused on wider concerns? relating to others present? to “Israel”? to/for God, however defined? Do these elements vary by person? gathering? moment?</span></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p style="padding: 0pt 6pt 0pt 4pt;"><span class="font0">Are extended improvs and long drumming sessions time for a break or the point of a concert? Is melody just a launching point for the “real,” improvisational music? Or are instrumentals sometimes just pauses, perhaps unduly long, in the melody? Which is “digression” and which is essential?</span></p>
</td>
<td>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding: 0pt 0pt 0pt 3pt;"><span class="font0">(Sanhedrin 2a continued)</span></p>
<p style="padding: 0pt 7pt 0pt 10pt;"><span class="font0">“...excluding Joshua and Caleb, we have ten, and whence do we derive the additional three?... ”</span></p>
<p style="padding: 0pt 7pt 0pt 3pt;"><span class="font0">The passage returns to what is ostensibly the “main discussion,” of how it is known that 23 men are needed for a small Sanhedrin.</span></p>
</td>
<td>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding: 0pt 7pt 0pt 3pt;"><span class="font0">It's the “digression” here that proves relevant to this week's portion and the definition of a minyan. Similarly, moments after a chant and spaces between words are as crucial as carefully crafted </span><span class="font0" style="font-style: italic;">siddur</span><span class="font0"> text.</span></p>
</td>
<td>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding: 0pt 13pt 0pt 3pt;"><span class="font0">We can sing prayers, chant, dance; re-order or re-focus the prayers; write new ones; share intentions. Sit silently. What is essential - for each of us and for us as a group -for prayer to “work”?</span></p>

<td>
<p style="padding: 0pt 25pt 0pt 4pt;"><span class="font0">At ticket time, many best seats for a (Grateful) Dead concert were empty while true Deadheads stayed outside, doing business and partying, until the concert began in earnest, and/or the Dead did not really get going until the seats filled. So, one might ask: How did anyone - band or fans - ever know when it “was time”?</span></p>

<td>
<p style="padding: 0pt 7pt 0pt 3pt;"><span class="font0">In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style: italic;">Shelach-lecha,</span><span class="font0"> the People believe the spies' “evil reports” about the Land and refuse to “go up.” This ends in death and disaster. Then, after being told that they will now die in the desert for failure to take the Land immediately, some make a last ditch effort to “go up” (14:40ff). This ends in disaster and death. How did the People (and God) learn the right time? Did they? Were 40 years enough? Too much?</span></p>
</td>
<td colspan="2">
<p style="text-align: right; padding: 0pt 10pt 0pt 3pt;"><span class="font0">Sefat Emet (R. Yehuda Aryeh Leib Alter, 1847-1905) identifies the last-ditch aliyah attempt with yearning for a kind of ungrounded, self-serving spirituality. In comparison, he urges: Before doing anything, you have to offer up your soul as an emissary, gathering together all of your desires, in order to negate them, so that you can fulfill only the will of God.</span></p>

<p style="padding: 0pt 17pt 0pt 4pt;"><span class="font0">Despite lack of introductions on stage and absence of album liners, many fans could identify current and past band members, knew each's musical history, and often referred to band members by first name as though speaking of near neighbors or cousins...</span></p>

<p style="padding: 0pt 17pt 0pt 4pt;"><span class="font0">Some histories of the band long known as “the Grateful Dead” might begin with the first concert in 1965, but many would say you have to start with the Warlocks or Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions or when band members met in 1962 or first learned music...</span></p>
</td>
<td>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding: 0pt 11pt 0pt 3pt;"><span class="font0">Like San. above, all Talmud tractates begin on page 2a. The first words of the first tractate -“From what time may one recite the evening Shema?” - assume so much that it's clear the conversation is already in progress. “2a” is a printer's convention, yes, but also a reminder that no amount of learning brings us to page 1.</span></p>
</td>
<td>
<p style="padding: 0pt 3pt 0pt 3pt;"><span class="font0">Taking as a given that we're, none of us, yet on page 1 can be freeing, an invitation to jump in and experience Jewish learning or prayer -or even a (Grateful) Dead recording - wherever we are.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; padding: 0pt 9pt 0pt 3pt;"><span class="font0">On the other hand, failing to recognize that we're jumping into an on-going enterprise, extending beyond our own lives and times, can narrow the experience into nonsense and noise.</span></p>

Well, I wasn’t at Woodstock and I’ve never been in a hangman’s noose waiting for the trap door to fall out, so I can’t sing that song? No, we just jump in because it touches us.
