post_title: 'Motzi &#8212; a kavanah before eating challah'
author: Trisha Arlin
post_excerpt: |
  Trisha Arlin shares "Motzi", a  <em>kavanah</em> (intention) for the blessing, <em>Hamotzi Lehem Min Ha'aretz</em>, over challah. Describing the kavanah she writes that it's, "based on <a href="http://www.kolotchayeinu.org/rabbi/">Rabbi Ellen Lippmann</a>’s tradition on having us create a chain of touch around room that leads to and from the challah, which she then explains as both exemplifying the connection created when people eat together and the chain of work that went to creating the challah itself."

Trisha Arlin shares "Motzi", a  <em>kavanah</em> (intention) for the blessing, <em>Hamotzi Lehem Min Ha'aretz</em>, over challah. Describing the kavanah she writes that it's

<blockquote>based on <a href="http://www.kolotchayeinu.org/rabbi_voice">Rabbi Ellen Lippmann</a>’s tradition on having us create a chain of touch around room that leads to and from the challah, which she then explains as both exemplifying the connection created when people eat together and the chain of work that went to creating the challah itself. A less generic version of this <em>motzi</em> was written for the service recently held in honor of the ordination of Cantor Lisa B. Segal and Rabbi Molly Kane.</blockquote>
