<div class="english">
Hashem, please do kiss warmly my mother/father hello 
as we struggle to kiss her/him good-bye.

Hashem, please favor me, to inhale smoothly her/him into your heart
as we exhale our rough grief from our entangled hearts.

Hashem, please with grace, lift quickly and wholly her/him into your embrace 
as we endure slowly her/him leaving this world’s firm grip.

Hashem, please grant me for you to slide quickly her/his body from her/his meritorious soul,
a soul providing sustaining milk/support to many for many years in many ways.

Hashem, please with compassion place her/his soul among her/his loved ones and friends
as we place her/his body among beloved flowers and fertile earth.

Hashem please, always show and remind me the many, blessed memories of her/him
till the day I too die, 

Amen
