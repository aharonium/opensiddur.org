post_excerpt: 'This is a transcription made by Gabriel Wasserman of <em>Seder Avodat Yisrael</em>, a critical text of the Ashkenaz nusaḥ by Isaac Seligman Baer published in 1868. Gabriel prepared this text for a maḥzor for Ḥanukah. At his request we have included all the liturgy aside from the piyyutim for Ḥanukah. This transcription does not include the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteg">meteg</a>, a punctuation mark used in Hebrew for denoting stress.'
