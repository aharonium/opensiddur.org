I designed a High Holy Days greeting card that is a <em>yad</em> (pointer) for all readers to use in their <em>siddurim</em> during services. It also functions as a place holder when one wishes to take a rest from following along.

Other Jewish ritual graphics (e.g. <em>omer</em> chart, pomegranate <em>pushka</em>) may be found on my Facebook page, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Jewish-and-Solar-Holiday-Graphics-by-Lieba-B-Ruth-aka-Lauren-Deutsch/261427247267722">Jewish-and-Solar-Holiday-Graphics-by-Lieba-B-Ruth</a>. Commissions gladly accepted. Please <a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/10062322375647990568">contact me</a> via e mail.

The place holder reads:
<blockquote>We're always trying to find where we are in the machzor and supplemental readers for the High Holy Days. Please allow this <em>YAD</em> (finger) to help you <em>find your place</em> this year.</blockquote>
