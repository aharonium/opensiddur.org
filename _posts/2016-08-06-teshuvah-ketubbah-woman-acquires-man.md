This teshuva provides the proper wording of a traditional ketubbah and reference to the enactment of marriage by the wife’s purchasing of the husband. The text includes the “Lieberman clause,” wherein it is agreed upon that the force of the Rabbinical Assembly’s and the Jewish Theological Seminary’s Joint Bet Din is sufficient for the nullification of the engagement and marriage of a couple wherein one partner is preventing the other from undergoing desired divorce proceedings. While the wording declaring the purchase of the wife is familiar since mishnaic times, the purchase of the husband is rarely written and unknown on the Internet (until today).
