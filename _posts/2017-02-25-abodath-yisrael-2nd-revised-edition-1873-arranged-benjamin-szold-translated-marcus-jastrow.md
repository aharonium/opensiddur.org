post_excerpt: |
  The siddur, <em>Aḅodath Yisrael</em> was first prepared for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Oheb_Shalom_(Baltimore,_Maryland)">Temple Oheb Shalom</a> (Baltimore, Maryland) by Rabbi Benjamin Szold (1829-1902). Before Szold's arrival in 1859, the congregation had adopted for use in its Shabbat service the <em>Minhag America</em> by the Reform rabbi, Isaac Meyer Wise. After much discussion with his congregation Szold introduced <em>Aḅodath Yisrael</em>, which hewed more closely to traditional Ashkenazi custom. The first edition of this prayer-book appeared in 1863 with German translation, and was widely adopted by congregations in the United States. New editions were published in 1864 and 1865 (the latter with English translation), and another, revised edition in 1871, by Rabbis Marcus Jastrow of Philadelphia (1829-1903) and Henry Hochheimer of Baltimore (1818-1912).
