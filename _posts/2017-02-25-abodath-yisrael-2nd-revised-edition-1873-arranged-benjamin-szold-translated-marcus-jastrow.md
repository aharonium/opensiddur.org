post_title: 'סידור עבודת ישראל | Siddur Aḅodath Yisrael, 2nd revised edition (1873) arranged by R&#8217; Benjamin Szold and translated by R&#8217; Marcus Jastrow'
author: Aharon N. Varady (transcription)
post_excerpt: |
  The siddur, <em>Aḅodath Yisrael</em> was first prepared for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Oheb_Shalom_(Baltimore,_Maryland)">Temple Oheb Shalom</a> (Baltimore, Maryland) by Rabbi Benjamin Szold (1829-1902). Before Szold's arrival in 1859, the congregation had adopted for use in its Shabbat service the <em>Minhag America</em> by the Reform rabbi, Isaac Meyer Wise. After much discussion with his congregation Szold introduced <em>Aḅodath Yisrael</em>, which hewed more closely to traditional Ashkenazi custom. The first edition of this prayer-book appeared in 1863 with German translation, and was widely adopted by congregations in the United States. New editions were published in 1864 and 1865 (the latter with English translation), and another, revised edition in 1871, by Rabbis Marcus Jastrow of Philadelphia (1829-1903) and Henry Hochheimer of Baltimore (1818-1912).

The siddur, <em>Aḅodath Yisrael</em> was first prepared for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Oheb_Shalom_(Baltimore,_Maryland)">Temple Oheb Shalom</a> (Baltimore, Maryland) by Rabbi Benjamin Szold (1829-1902). Before Szold's arrival in 1859, the congregation had adopted for use in its Shabbat service the <em>Minhag America</em> by the Reform rabbi, Isaac Meyer Wise. After much discussion with his congregation Szold introduced <em>Aḅodath Yisrael</em>, which hewed more closely to traditional Ashkenazi custom. The first edition of this prayer-book appeared in 1863 with German translation, and was widely adopted by congregations in the United States. New editions were published in 1864 and 1865 (the latter with English translation), and another, revised edition in 1871, by Rabbis Marcus Jastrow of Philadelphia (1829-1903) and Henry Hochheimer of Baltimore (1818-1912).

The edition we have imaged and made available here is the 2nd revised edition from 1873 which Marcus Jastrow prepared for his Philadelphia congregation, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregation_Rodeph_Shalom_(Philadelphia)">Rodef-Shalom</a>. The siddur was first published in one volume. The 1885 printing of the 2nd revised edition of 1873 separates the contents of <em>Aḅodath Yisrael</em> into two volumes, the first containing Sabbath, Festival, and Weekday prayers, and the second volume containing the High Holiday services. A supplemental section, <em>Songs and Prayers and Meditations</em> appended to the first volume. Appearing at the end of the first volume, in the Appendix, there is a chart providing <a href="https://archive.org/stream/AvodathYisraelVol1BenjaminSzoldTrans.MarcusJastrow18732ndEd.Rev.1885/AvodathYisraelbenjaminSzoldTrans.MarcusJastrow18732ndEd.Rev.1885#page/n198/mode/2up">the Torah portions according to the Tri-Annual cycle</a>.

Making digital images of these works available is the first step in our process of making the entire prayerbook, both Hebrew liturgy and English translation, machine-readable (copy-pastable and searchable).
