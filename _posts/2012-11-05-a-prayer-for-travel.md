  <em>Yehi Ratzon Milfanecha</em> - May it be Your will,
  Eternal One, God of our ancestors, that we journey toward peace, that our footsteps be guided towards peace, and that we reach our desired destinations for life, gladness, and peace. May we be protected from every obstacle along the way, and from all manner of challenge the world endures. May there be blessing in the works of our hands, and may we be granted peace, kindness, and mercy in the eyes of all who see us. May our prayer be heard, for You are the One who hears and holds all prayer. <em>Baruch Atah Adonai, Shomei'ah Tefilah</em>. Blessed are You, Eternal One, who hears prayer.
