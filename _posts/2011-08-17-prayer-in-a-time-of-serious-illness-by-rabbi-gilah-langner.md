post_excerpt: 'Traditional Judaism offers a confessional prayer, or vidui, to be recited during a time of serious illness or near death.  If the patient is unable to recite the prayer, others may do so on his or her behalf.  This modern adaptation [of vidui] places less emphasis on atonement for sins, and more on the bonds connecting the patient to his or her loved ones.  It can be recited by a friend, family member, or chaplain on behalf of a person who is very ill, especially when life and death are hanging in the balance. '

Traditional Judaism offers a confessional prayer, or <code>vidui</code>, to be recited during a time of serious illness or near death.  If the patient is unable to recite the prayer, others may do so on his or her behalf.  This modern adaptation [of vidui] places less emphasis on atonement for sins, and more on the bonds connecting the patient to his or her loved ones.  It can be recited by a friend, family member, or chaplain on behalf of a person who is very ill, especially when life and death are hanging in the balance.  
    –In memory of Dr. Paul Woolf z”l</em>

Our God and God of our ancestors, we acknowledge that all of life is in Your hands.

We pray for healing for this beloved (woman/man).  
May (she/he) be filled and embraced by a complete and healing love and forgiveness.  
May (she/he) always know how precious his life is to those who love (her/him).

Protect ___________’s beloved family: ___________________________.
Their souls are woven together for all time.

Grant hope and strength to _____________’s family and caregivers, guiding their hands and hearts and decisions with wisdom, loving care, and skill.
