post_excerpt: >
  Many of our best times are spent eating.
  Jewish liturgy, however, is very stingy
  on blessings before eating (focusing
  much of its energy on blessings after
  eating). The blessings before food are
  generic, and except for very specific
  foods and drinks (such as wine, bread,
  and matzah), all foods lump into three
  or four categories (fruit, vegetables,
  grains, and everything else). As a
  foodie, I’d like to celebrate each and
  every distinct taste through the prism
  of Jewish experience, and thus have
  tried to compose as many short poems as
  possible in their honor.

I am a humanist. I am a feminist. I am an environmentalist. I am a libertarian. I am a pacifist. I believe in democracy. I am an agnostic. Traditional Jewish prayer is not any of these “ists” or “ics”; it reflects the worldview of the rabbis 1500 years ago, who may have been quite sagacious but did not share many of my values. The minor and major edits, deletions, and additions to which liberal Jews of this day and age have treated their prayers have inserted some of these sentiments, but for the most part the macro structure of prayers has been preserved, making it difficult for people to engage with the prayer in a straightforward way. The composers of liberal prayer books understand this, and thus we find the phenomenon of alternative or additional English readings and/or very creative translations that bear little relationship to the original prayer. There is another way forward, though. We can compose new prayers and poetry in the original Hebrew that reflect our values and revitalize our canon. This is the way I chose.
