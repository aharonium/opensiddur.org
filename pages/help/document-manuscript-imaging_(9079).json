The title, hierophant, originated in Ancient Greece and combines the words <span lang=\"el\">φαίνω</span> (<em>phainein</em>, \"to show\") and <span lang=\"el\">‏τα ειρα</span> (<em>ta hiera</em>, \"the holy\"); hierophants served as interpreters of sacred mysteries and arcane principles. For the Open Siddur Project, the Hierophant welcomes new contributors and explains <a href=\"http://opensiddur.org/development/mission\">our mission</a>: ensuring creatively inspired work intended for communal use is shared freely for creative reuse and redistribution.",

(If you would like to begin looking for a book to image, please see our wishlist.)</p>\n<p>Imaging is critical in providing a source image by which collaborative transcription and proofreading may be performed. Maintaining links between the document image and the digital text in our database is also important in order for the authority of the text to be available to future researchers.<br />\n<span class=\"\" style=\"display:block;clear:both;height: 0px;margin-top: ;border-top-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;\"></span></p>\n<h2>A Short Imaging Tutorial</h2>\n<h3>What to image</h3>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Please image the whole book including the title page and, if available, the copyright page.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Sometimes, the content desired makes up only shot segments, sections, or pages of the books.

With too low a resolution and it is nearly impossible to make out the many diacritical marks that form vowels and other significant distinctions in words and letters.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">A good image is made at a resolution where the characters in the smallest text on the page can be resolved into a unique character when the image is displayed at 100% zoom.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">For these reasons, images should be made at a high resolution: at least 300dpi (dots per inch). For our purposes, images can be JPG or PNG files.</p>\n<h3>Naming files</h3>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">It is best to name files in a sequence where each page is contained in one file, and the filename is the page number followed by the extension. For example, 5.jpg for page 5, or 10.jpg for page 10.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Do not be concerned whether your numbering of images remains consistent with the page numbers. Simply treat each page with its own number from the first leaf to the back leaf.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">If page numbers repeat across two sides of the same folio (for instance, between a recto and its verso), it is not necessary to indicate which is side a or b.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">If, for some reason, you cannot follow these conventions, then send us the scans with each file numbered in sequence (1.jpg, 2.jpg, 3.jpg, etc.).</p>\n<h3>Image Processing</h3>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><a href=\"http://scantailor.org/downloads/\">ScanTailor</a> is open-source software that processes your images into page images suitable for compiling into a reasonably sized PDF that we can upload to the Internet Archive. If you&#8217;d prefer not to do this step. That is fine. The main thing is to take high quality images of all the pages of the book or manuscript.</p>\n<span class=\"\" style=\"display:block;clear:both;height: 0px;margin-top: ;border-top-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;\"></span>\n<h3>Temporary Storage for Uploading Images</h3>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">After you&#8217;ve imaged a book, you&#8217;re left with hundreds of image files. The size of an entire collection can easily be more than 250mb &#8212; far larger than can be distributed via email. Free services like <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://dropbox.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">dropbox.com</a> offer temporary storage and dissemination of compressed batches of scanned images.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">After you&#8217;ve scanned the book,</p>\n<ol>\n<li>compress the collection in your preferred compression format (zip, tar.gz, rar),</li>\n<li>upload it to an account at dropbox.com, Google Drive, box.net (or other similar service), and</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/contact/\">contact us</a> with a link where we can download the file.</li>\n</ol>\n<span class=\"\" style=\"display:block;clear:both;height: 0px;margin-top: ;border-top-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;\"></span>\n<h3>Credit for Imaging</h3>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">The Open Siddur Project will credit all contributors of high quality imaging for their scanning or photography.</p>\n</div>\n",
