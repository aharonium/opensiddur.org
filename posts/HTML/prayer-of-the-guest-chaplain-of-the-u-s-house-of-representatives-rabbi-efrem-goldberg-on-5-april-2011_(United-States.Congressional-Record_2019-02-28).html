<blockquote>
<h3>One Minute Speech Given in Recognition of the Guest Chaplain:</h3>

Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to welcome Rabbi Efrem Goldberg to our Nation's Capitol and thank him for delivering such an insightful opening invocation.

Rabbi Goldberg's presence here today is especially significant to me, for I regularly study under his guidance. Since entering public life, I have become all the more grateful to have him as a spiritual mentor. His insights help me serve my constituents and work to better our world in a way that honors our Jewish tradition.

As Senior Rabbi of Boca Raton Synagogue, Rabbi Goldberg leads a wonderful congregation of over 700 families and 1,200 children. This February, after an extraordinary first 5 years as Senior Rabbi, it was announced that he will continue to lead the congregation for the next decade.

His energy, vision, and wisdom touch everyone he meets, just as it did for us here this morning when he provided us with his compelling and thoughtful invocation.
