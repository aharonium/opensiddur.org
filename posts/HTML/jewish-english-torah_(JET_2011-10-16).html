This week on the holiday of Simḥat Torah, the Jewish people will begin to read the Torah anew, starting with <a href="http://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1/en/Jewish_English_Torah?lang=en&amp;layout=block&amp;sidebarLang=all"><em>Parashat Bereshit</em></a>. The JET is a new English translation of <a href="http://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1/en/Jewish_English_Torah?lang=en&amp;layout=block&amp;sidebarLang=all"><em>Parashat Bereshit</em></a> that is meant to be readable (and enjoyable to read), useful to people who want to study the parashah, and faithful to the Hebrew text of the Torah.

JET stands for the “Jewish English Torah” (or for the “Jewish English Tanakh” if we want to be very ambitious).

<h3>An initial example</h3>

This translation of <a href="http://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1/en/Jewish_English_Torah?lang=en&amp;layout=block&amp;sidebarLang=all"><em>Parashat Bereshit</em></a> is meant as a sample and as an example. I do not plan to translate the entire Torah myself (let alone the whole Tanakh). Rather, this translation of the first portion of the Torah is meant to serve as a model in order to encourage others to create their own modern translations of the Torah/Tanakh (parts of it or all of it), so that the Open Siddur Project can become the host for a collaborative effort to create new Tanakh translations under free licenses that anyone can use freely.

In order to further that goal, I would like to describe how I did this translation of <a href="http://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1/en/Jewish_English_Torah?lang=en&amp;layout=block&amp;sidebarLang=all"><em>Parashat Bereshit</em></a>, and why I did it that way. Then others can either adopt the same method or change it according to their personal needs and tastes. There is no one particular style of translation that is right for everyone, but in a collaborative Open Content environment such as the Open Siddur Project there is also no problem creating alternatives and adaptations. My translation of <a href="http://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1/en/Jewish_English_Torah?lang=en&amp;layout=block&amp;sidebarLang=all"><em>Parashat Bereshit</em></a> is just one example of a particular way it can be done.

<h3>Other translations as sources</h3>

First I must begin by saying that I didn't write this translation from scratch. I wanted a translation that, while in modern English, was still firmly within the literary tradition of high-quality English Bible translations, specifically the tradition that began with King James Version (KJV), and continued to be adapted in the 19th and 20th centuries with the American Standard Version (ASV), the Revised Standard Version (RSV), and the New Revised Standard Version (NRSV).

For Jews whose healthy instinct is to react negatively to the names of all these mostly Christian “versions” (though the NRSV also included some Jewish scholars), I ask you to consider two points: First, “accept the truth no matter who it comes from” (Maimonides, preface to the <em>Eight Chapters</em>). We are not talking about the truth of Torah here, but about how to render that truth tastefully in English. The English-speaking Christian world has accumulated vast expertise in this area over the course of centuries. We should make use of that expertise.

Second, it is important to realize how dependent Jewish translations have always been on this English literary tradition. The JPS 1917 version, which is currently being edited and made freely available here at the Open Siddur Project, was based heavily on the KJV. The new JPS version, while far more original, still fits squarely into the same literary genre and openly draws upon its style. And even Orthodox translations such as Artscroll draw heavily on these classic Jewish and non-Jewish translations (though they rarely acknowledge it).

So as raw material, I used an existing translation into modern English rather than starting from scratch, one that is itself based upon this literary tradition and has been released into the public domain. The translation I used, called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_English_Bible">World English Bible</a> (WEB), is a basically good one (though very far from perfect). Even though it is mostly the work of a single person, it still competes surprisingly well with other similar translations that were prepared by accredited committees. It is very much a Christian translation in its style, in its frequent Christological interpretations, and in its preference for the Greek text in certain places (though it usually reflects the Hebrew), and as such it is unsuitable for Jewish use in its current form. However, as raw material for a new translation it is quite useful. I will post more about this translation and its author later <a href="http://opensiddur.org/by/JET">on my user page</a>.

<h3>Revising the base text</h3>

As I went over the <a href="http://www.ebible.org/web/">raw text</a> of the WEB, I first and foremost compared it with the Hebrew throughout, and also made numerous stylistic changes. I often consulted the classic Jewish commentaries for their insights on the <em>peshat</em> level (the “plain sense” of the text). In many places I also compared it with my own favorite translations, namely the NJPS translation, the NRSV, and Robert Alter's new translation of the Torah. Often, when it seemed both feasible and tasteful, I adopted Alter's method keeping the keeping the English word order in line with that of the Hebrew, but not always in the same way Alter did nor to the same extent.

In terms of copyright, I followed the reasonable approach of the WEB that any new translation offered freely to the public should be “different enough to avoid copyright infringement,” which means that “the wording is about as different from any one Modern English translation as the current translations differ from each other.”

There is a great deal of “theological translation” in the WEB, not all of it overtly Christological. For instance, the word “soul” is often used, even though that concept is difficult to justify as <em>peshat</em> in the Torah. It goes without saying that I have modified the translation in such places, as well as for all of the blatant Christological translations. One special example is in the translation of Genesis 4:1 in which I followed Rashi (“Now the man had known Eve his wife...”), though not too many people know that controversy about the meaning of the form of this verb was a major example of Jewish-Christian polemics in the Middle Ages. The Jewish interpretation, influenced by the <em>midrash</em> and by the form of the verb, was that Eve conceived while still in Eden, i.e. that marriage and parenthood are a part of an ideal world. (Cf. the similar verb form in 3:1; the serpent did not just then become the shrewdest of the wild beasts, but already was!)

Besides larger matters of style and interpretation, specific technical changes made throughout to the raw base text include the following: The divine name pronounced “<em>Adonai</em>” is rendered as “the Lord” and pronouns referring to God are capitalized. In both cases this means returning to the KJV tradition, as opposed to the ASV and the WEB which abandoned it in these two cases. (In terms of the divine name, the ASV proudly announced in 1901 that it would reject a “Jewish superstition” by no longer rendering that name as “Lord.”) The use of contractions (which the author of the WEB justified based on the informal Greek language of the Christian New Testament) has also been abandoned (since the Hebrew Bible is normally in elevated language).

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

To conclude, I would like to emphasize that <a href="http://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1/en/Jewish_English_Torah?lang=en&amp;layout=block&amp;sidebarLang=all"><em>Parashat Bereshit</em></a> is only an example. I do not plan to personally translate the Torah (much less the Tanakh), but in the future I will probably contribute various sections that I re-translate on my own for teaching purposes. More importantly, <strong>I would like to invite others to contribute further Open Content translations for parts of the Torah or Tanakh to the Open Siddur Project, whether by following my method or in any other style.</strong> In time, together we could create a rich resource full of translations of all parts of the Tanakh in a variety of useful forms. That would be a wonderful thing to start on Simḥat Torah.

{P} <span id="1:24" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>1:24 </sup></small></span>God said, "Let the earth produce living creatures after their kind, livestock, creeping things, and beasts of the earth after their kind"; and it was so. <span id="1:25" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>1:25 </sup></small></span>God made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the livestock after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind, and God saw that it was good. <span id="1:26" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>1:26 </sup></small></span>God said, "Let Us make man in Our image, after Our likeness.

{P} <span id="2:4" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>2:4 </sup></small></span>This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, on the day the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span> God made Earth and Heaven. <span id="2:5" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>2:5 </sup></small></span>No plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span> God had not caused it to rain on the earth, and there was no man to till the ground. <span id="2:6" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>2:6 </sup></small></span>But a mist went up from the earth, and watered the whole surface of the ground. <span id="2:7" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>2:7 </sup></small></span>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord </span>God formed the man from the dust of the ground, and blew into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living creature. <span id="2:8" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>2:8 </sup></small></span>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span> God planted a garden in Eden in the east, and there He put the man whom He had formed. <span id="2:9" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>2:9 </sup></small></span>Out of the ground the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord </span>God made every tree grow that is pleasant to the sight and good for food, with the tree of life in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. <span id="2:10" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>2:10 </sup></small></span>A river goes out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it parts and becomes four heads. <span id="2:11" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>2:11 </sup></small></span>The name of the first is Pishon, that is the one which flows through the whole land of Havilah where there is gold. <span id="2:12" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>2:12 </sup></small></span>The gold of that land is good, bdellium is there and lapis lazuli. <span id="2:13" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>2:13 </sup></small></span>The name of the second river is Gihon, the one that winds through the whole land of Cush. <span id="2:14" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>2:14 </sup></small></span>The name of the third river is Hiddekel, the one which flows east of Assyria, and the fourth river is the Euphrates. <span id="2:15" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>2:15 </sup></small></span>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span> God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to work it and to keep it. <span id="2:16" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>2:16 </sup></small></span>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span> God commanded the man, saying, "Of every tree of the garden you may surely eat. <span id="2:17" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>2:17 </sup></small></span>But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat of it; for in the day that you eat of it you will surely die."

<span id="2:18" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>2:18 </sup></small></span>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span> God said, "It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make him a fitting helper." <span id="2:19" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>2:19 </sup></small></span>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord </span>God formed out of the ground every beast of the field and every bird of the heavens, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them. Whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name. <span id="2:20" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>2:20 </sup></small></span>The man gave names to all livestock, and to the birds of the heavens, and to every beast of the field, but for the man there was not found a fitting helper. <span id="2:21" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>2:21 </sup></small></span>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span> God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man and he slept; and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place. <span id="2:22" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>2:22 </sup></small></span>He made the rib, which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span> God had taken from the man, into a woman, and He brought her to the man. <span id="2:23" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>2:23 </sup></small></span>The
man said, "This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. She will be called Woman ['ishah] for from man ['ish] was she taken." <span id="2:24" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>2:24 </sup></small></span>Therefore a man will leave his father and his mother, and will join with his wife, and they will become one flesh. <span id="2:25" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>2:25 </sup></small></span>They were both naked, the man and his wife, yet they were not ashamed.

<span id="3:1" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>3:1 </sup></small></span>Now the serpent was the shrewdest of all the wild beasts which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span> God had made. He said to the woman, "Has God really said, 'You shall not eat of any tree of the garden?'"

<span id="3:2" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>3:2 </sup></small></span>The woman said to the serpent, "Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may surely eat. <span id="3:3" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>3:3 </sup></small></span>But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, 'You shall not eat of it, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.'"

<span id="3:4" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>3:4 </sup></small></span>The serpent said to the woman, "You will surely not die, <span id="3:5" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>3:5 </sup></small></span>for God knows that on the day you eat it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."

<span id="3:6" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>3:6 </sup></small></span>The woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one wise. She took of its fruit and ate, and she gave some to her husband beside her and he ate. <span id="3:7" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>3:7 </sup></small></span>The eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked. They sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves loinclothes. <span id="3:8" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>3:8 </sup></small></span>They heard the sound of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span> God walking in the garden in the breeze of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span> God among the trees of the garden.

<span id="3:9" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>3:9 </sup></small></span>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span> God called to the man, and said to him, "Where are you?" <span id="3:10" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>3:10 </sup></small></span>The man said, "I heard Your sound in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked and hid myself."

<span id="3:11" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>3:11 </sup></small></span>God said, "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten of the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?" <span id="3:12" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>3:12 </sup></small></span>The man said, "The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree and I ate."

<span id="3:13" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>3:13 </sup></small></span>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span> God said to the woman, "What is this you have done?" The woman said, "The serpent deceived me and I ate."

<span id="3:14" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>3:14 </sup></small></span>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord </span>God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, you are more cursed that all livestock, and above every beast of the field. On your belly you shall go, and you shall eat dust all the days of your life. <span id="3:15" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>3:15 </sup></small></span>I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring. He will bruise your head, and you will bruise his heel."

{S} <span id="3:16" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>3:16 </sup></small></span>To the woman he said, "I will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth, in pain will you bear children. Your longing will be for your husband and he will rule you."

{S} <span id="3:17" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>3:17 </sup></small></span>To the man he said, "Because you heeded the voice of your wife, and ate from the tree of which I commanded you, saying, 'You shall not eat of it,' cursed is the ground because of you, in toil you will eat from it all the days of your life. <span id="3:18" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>3:18 </sup></small></span>It will yield thorns and thistles to you, and you will eat the herb of the field. <span id="3:19" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>3:19 </sup></small></span>By the sweat of your face will you eat bread, until you return to the ground, for from it you were taken. For you are dust, and to dust you shall return."

<span id="3:20" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>3:20 </sup></small></span>The man called his wife Eve, because she was the mother of all that lives. <span id="3:21" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>3:21 </sup></small></span>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span> God made coats of skins for Adam and for his wife and clothed them.

{P} <span id="3:22" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>3:22 </sup></small></span>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord </span>God said, "See, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil, now what if he should reach out his hand, and take as well of the tree of life, and eat and live forever?" <span id="3:23" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>3:23 </sup></small></span>Therefore the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span> God sent him out of the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken. <span id="3:24" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>3:24 </sup></small></span>So He drove out the man, and He placed the Cherubs at the east of the garden of Eden, and the flame of the revolving sword, to guard the way to the tree of life.

<span id="4:16" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>4:16 </sup></small></span>Cain left the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span>'s presence, and dwelt in the land of Nod, east of Eden. <span id="4:17" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>4:17 </sup></small></span>Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and gave birth to Enoch.

<span id="4:19" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>4:19 </sup></small></span>Lamech took himself two wives, the name of the one was Adah and the name of the other was Zillah. <span id="4:20" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>4:20 </sup></small></span>Adah bore Jabal, who was the father of those who dwell in tents with livestock. <span id="4:21" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>4:21 </sup></small></span>His brother's name was Jubal, who was the father of all who play the lyre and pipe. <span id="4:22" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>4:22 </sup></small></span>As for Zillah, she bore Tubal-Cain, who forged every instrument of brass and iron.

<span id="4:25" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>4:25 </sup></small></span>Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and called him Seth: "For God has given me other seed instead of Abel, for Cain killed him." <span id="4:26" style="color: gray;"><small><sup>4:26 </sup></small></span>There was also born a son to Seth, and he named him Enosh.
