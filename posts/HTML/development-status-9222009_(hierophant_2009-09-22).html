<strong>Open Siddur Project Development Status as of 9/22/2009</strong>

Our  second development status covers progress on the Open Siddur made since  our last update 8/23/09. Email <a href="mailto:aharon@opensiddur.org">aharon@opensiddur.org</a> if you  want to include something we haven't covered. For now we'll be  sending these out once a month but if  you'd like to get news of Open Siddur as it happens, make sure to  follow <a href="http://twitter.com/opensiddur">@opensiddur</a> at Twitter.
<strong>Contributions</strong>

A beautiful scan of the Routledge Mahzor was contributed to the <a href="https://archive.org">Internet Archive</a> by the  Princeton Theological Seminary Library (see <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/jewishliturgy-discuss/t/433a218e6f5a130b">http://groups.google.com/group/jewishliturgy-discuss/t/433a218e6f5a130b</a>).  Other important scans of siddurim in the public domain have been uploaded by the University  of Toronto and the YIVO Institute. Scans contributed through the  Internet Archive provide the Open Siddur project with a well of texts  for digital transcription.

We are looking for a copy of Siddur Torah Ohr to correct and proof a  digital transcription of the siddur already available CC-BY-SA at  wikisource. Do you have one we could use? Please let us know.

The <a href="http://www.law.tulane.edu/tlscenters/iplc/"> Tulane Center for Intellectual Property Law and Culture</a> is consulting  with Open Siddur on the copyright status of extant works that may be in  the public domain. Thanks Ben and Justin!

<strong>Documentation</strong>

How can folk contribute material to  the Open Siddur Project <em>right now</em>? See our new <a href="https://opensiddur.org/contribute/upload/">https://opensiddur.org/contribute/upload/</a> for more information.

We are looking for volunteers to just look over our documentation  and help us know how it reads and where we can make improvements. Anyone  can freely register to edit on our <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100507124255/http://wiki.jewishliturgy.org:80/Conditionals">conditional  inclusion feature</a>.

<strong>Volunteer Management</strong>

Open Siddur is looking for  someone to gradually step into the role of <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/jewishliturgy-discuss/t/8fd0ce2299825b1b">volunteer manager</a>. If folks want to step up, then Efraim and Aharon are ready to apprentice  them :)

<strong>Organization/Structure</strong>

How can we best  describe the principles which inspire a project that seeks to be both a  repository of traditional historical texts and a resource for folks  sharing new translations, t'fillot, commentary, and other content? We  now have a draft <a href="https://opensiddur.org/development/mission/">Mission Statement</a>.  We've had some feedback  on the discussion list and would like some more.

We also have a  list of <a href="https://github.com/opensiddur/opensiddur/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22Server+v1.0%22">milestones</a> to  help track our progress and note where we are falling behind.

<strong>Communication and Promotion</strong>

JT Waldman at the  Jewish Publication Society posted a lovely article with some choice  quotes from Aharon Varady on "Judaism, Free Culture, and the Open Siddur  Project." (Thanks to JT and JPS! Check out http://jpsinteractive.org/blog/jt/sneak-peek-tagged-tanakh for a sneak peek at JPS' innovative interactive TaNaKh project.)

Rabbi Saul Berman had some thoughts on why new siddurim cannot  mitigate against the influence of modernity. Aharon responds <a href="https://opensiddur.org/2009/09/spiritual-alienation-and-the-siddur/">here</a>,  and also on our discussion list <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/jewishliturgy-discuss/msg/939de5bf7e7ba48c">here</a>.

The Lookstein Institute has been helping to inform educators about  the work of the Open Siddur in their newsletter.  (Thank you!)

The Lookstein Institute and JESNA also helped us disseminate our  invitation to educators who might know of students that might be  interested in developing theirs skills with a compelling software  project such as ours: <a href="../2009/08/invitation-to-young-technologists/">https://opensiddur.org/2009/08/invitation-to-young-technologists/</a> (Thank you!)

We had our second ever Open Siddur Open Chat at irc://irc.freenode.net/jewisliturgy on September 13th. The summary and logs of the chat are available on our wiki.

<strong>Software Development</strong>

Efraim is working on a  partial implementation of XPointer to be used in our XSLT transforms and  XQuery.  In the process, he developed a generic parser generator for  XSLT (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20111014021609/http://wiki.jewishliturgy.org:80/XSLT_Grammar_Parser">http://wiki.jewishliturgy.org/XSLT_Grammar_Parser</a>).   This is a prerequisite to the continued development of (1) toolkit  APIs that grab ordered text segments from JLPTEI documents and (2)  transforms to convert JLPTEI to other forms. The code is currently under  testing.

Azriel has been developing OSNAT, the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/jewishliturgy-discuss/browse_thread/thread/0ece3140bcf90f6b#">Open Siddur Network  Application for Transcription</a>.  It's still in rough alpha, but includes a fly in-browser Hebrew Unicode  5.0 standard keyboard.

We are always looking for more software developers! Interested?  Please contact us with your skills.

<strong>System Administration</strong>

Azriel  writes, "We have begun nightly backups of the MySQL database." If  anyone would like to give us a hand with administration of the wiki or  the *nix system it lives on, please email him, <a href="mailto:azriel@opensiddur.org">azriel@opensiddur.org</a>

Efraim writes, "I've upgraded the eXist installation to a version  closer to the 1.4 release candidate (eXist subversion revision 10000),  and set up the versioning filter in the /db/base collection. This should  give us revision tracking for newly stored XML data.   Revision  tracking on the code and schemas will still be done using Google Code  subversion."

<strong>Team Member Updates</strong>

Dan Sieradski's Jew It  Yourself and Eileen Levinson's <a href="http://haggadot.com/">Haggadot.com</a> recently got seed funding from Lynn Schusterman's ROI. Congrats!

Aharon Varady began a fellowship for Judaic Studies at North  America's first egalitarian yeshiva, <a href="http://www.mechonhadar.org/yeshivat-hadar1">Yeshivat Hadar</a>.  Huzzah!

<strong>On behalf of the entire Open Siddur Project team, Happy New Year  5770! Here's wishing you all a productive year of inspired learning,  compassionate living, and loving-kindness nourished by creativity and  wonder.</strong></div>
