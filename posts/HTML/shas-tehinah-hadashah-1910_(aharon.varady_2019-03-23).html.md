This collection of teḥinot includes Ben-Tsiyon's <em>Maase Alfes</em> (Tales of Alfes) and contains additional insights drawn from a handful of other sources collectively referred to as "Rav Peninim" (A Multitude of Pearls). These other sources include: Binyan Tsiyon, Shaarei Tsiyon, P'ri Hagafen, Peninim Yeqarim (Rabbi Shimon Betzalel Neuman), Rishon L'tsiyon, and Tiferet Tsiyon.

Dr. Chava Weissler <a href="http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Tkhines">writes</a>:

<blockquote>By the mid-nineteenth century, different forms of tkhines appeared. As East European Jewish family structure changed, and the age of marriage rose, tkhines were composed that expressed an entirely new sensibility, influenced by the rising ideal of the bourgeois family, with its stress on sentiment and emotional family ties and its new definition of gender roles.

Moreover, tkhines themselves became vehicles for various reformist programs. Ben-Tsiyon Alfes (1850–1940), an Orthodox author and activist, composed Shas tkhine khadoshe (A New Tkhine of Six Orders) as an integral part of his project to spread love for traditional Jewish life, hoping thereby to counteract the influence of secularism. His tkhines repeatedly point to the critical role of women in maintaining a Jewish home and raising Jewish children. Further, his view of the family was influenced by the image of the ideal bourgeois family of his day.</blockquote>

Shas Teḥinah Ḥadashah was published by Rosenkranz & Schriftsetzer, Abraham Z. Rosenkranz (1815-1901) in partnership with a younger brother and Samuel Joseph Finn. (Schriftsetzer means typesetter in Yiddish.)
