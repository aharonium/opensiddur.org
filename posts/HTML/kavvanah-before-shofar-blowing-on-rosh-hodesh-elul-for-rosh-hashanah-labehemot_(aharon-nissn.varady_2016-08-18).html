<div class="english">
On the day intended to <em>count</em> one's animals for sacrificial temple offerings, <em>take into account</em> and consider how domesticated animals
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">rely on humankind for their health and well-being
and in what ways our lives rely upon those of domesticated animals.</p>
On Rosh Ḥodesh Elul, the first day of the new moon of Elul, we begin an <em>accounting</em> for all the souls with whom we are in a relationship.

On a day dedicated to <em>counting</em>, this is an <em>accounting</em> (a <em>ḥeshbon nefesh</em>) for all of our souls.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Before we can expect to be forgiven our transgressions,
we must examine them thoroughly, and wherever possible, correct and heal them.</p>
On Rosh Hashanah La'Behemot, the New Years Day for Domesticated Animals, we specifically take into account 
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">all those souls which we depend upon for our diet and lifestyle choices 
and which, in turn, depend upon us for their well-being --
all the creatures that we (our society, and our ancestors before us) have brought 
from the category of <em>ḥayot</em> (wild animals that can make their own living) 
into the category of <em>behemot</em> (domesticated animals which depend upon us for their living).</p>
Just as we depend on the Compassionate One (<em>haRaḥaman</em>) for our sustenance,
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">so too has humankind made many creatures dependent upon our welfare,
directly through our need for them,
and indirectly through our disruption of their ecosystem.</p>
On the first day of Rosh Ḥodesh Elul when the shofar is blown to remind us to begin our preparation for <em>Yamim Noraim</em>, the Days of Awe,
<ul>
    <li>consider all the animals that were once domesticated and now live as homeless scavengers in our communities,</li>
    <li>all the animals being used for experiments intended to improve human life,</li>
    <li>all the animals kept captive to satisfy appetites for flesh and clothing made from their bodies.</li>
</ul>
The <em>mitsvah</em> in the Torah that demands our mindful awareness of the suffering of all living creatures is called <em>tsa'ar baalei ḥayim</em>.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We are forbidden to cause other creatures unnecessary suffering,
and we are obligated not to turn away from, pass by, or neglect other creatures
that have fallen under the burden our fellow human beings have placed upon them.</p>
Before we ask the blessed Holy One, our Shepherd,
to take responsibility with care and compassion for their flock,
we must show that we are taking care and responsibility
for the flock that depends on us.

For Elohim gave us dominion -- the power to domesticate other creatures -- to cultivate and preserve the Garden of Eden with them. We are liable for their care and we are liable for our impact together on Adamah, which Elohim loves.

<strong>Take a census of all the creatures you are directly and indirectly in relationship with.
In what way can you take responsibility for the animals on whom your lifestyle and diet depends?</strong>

Take a moment, consider, and share your your thoughts with a friend or someone next to you, then pause and <em>"<strong>listen for the voice of the animals in the sound of the shofar.</strong>"</em>

<em>Take a moment for people to coalesce, share thoughts. </em>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>On the first day of the month of Elul,
on the New Year's Day for all animals that depend on us for their welfare,
when our thoughts turn inwards towards correcting and healing all of our relationships,
listen for the voice of the animals in the sound of the shofar.</strong></p>
<em>(The shofar is blown once, a single tekiyah/blast.)</em>

<em>Open the gates to the animal pen and let any shepherded animals (e.g. goats) run free.</em>

We have become as the <em>Nefilim</em> and the Giants in the Generation of the Flood: tyrants on this planet, using its resources for ourselves and driving animals into the corners of the earth.

As our energy, food, settlement, and other land use choices impact and disrupt the capability of <em>ḥayot</em> (wild animals) to make their own living, the more we incur liability for their lives as animals that depend on us for their welfare.

Before we can make amends to one another this <em>Elul Zman</em>, we must first make amends to the vulnerable creatures who live among us.

As we hear the cry of the shofar for the first time, may we hear in it the cry of all animals, <em>behemot</em> and <em>ḥayot</em>, together with all our interconnected ecosystems supporting life on earth.

May the One who is the breath of life guide us to protect the earth and make room in it for other creatures to thrive.

<em>(The shofar is blown a second time.)</em>

We are grateful for all the good we receive from <em>behemot</em>, from domesticated animals.
<ul>
    <li>Some of us eat them,</li>
    <li>some wear their skins,</li>
    <li>some eat eggs and cheese,</li>
    <li>some use medicines and even organs that come from animals,</li>
    <li>some wear wool and silk,</li>
    <li>some write on Torah scrolls, wear <em>tefillin</em>, and blow <em>shofarot</em> that come from animal’s bodies.</li>
    <li>Some of us do none of these things, but we benefit from the bee that pollinates the flowers and the worm that softens the earth.</li>
</ul>
May the One who is the breath of life cause us to be mindful of these gifts and never to waste them or take them for granted.

<em>(The shofar is blown a third time.)</em>

We bless all the creatures, <em>behemot</em> and <em>ḥayot</em> we are privileged to live with on the earth:
<ul>
    <li>the loving companion animals who live in our houses,</li>
    <li>the birds at our windows and in the forests,</li>
    <li>the burrowing creatures under our feet,</li>
    <li>the fish in the waters of our streams and oceans.</li>
</ul>
May the One who is the breath of life bless all living things that we love and strengthen them.

We bless all the spirits, all the <em>nefashot</em> we are privileged to live with on the earth, the known and the unknown.</div>

For the Leader. [A Psalm] of David the servant of YHVH.

Transgression speaks to the wicked, methinks—
There is no fear of God before their eyes.

For it flatters them in their eyes,
Until their iniquity is found, and they be hated.

The words of their mouth are iniquity and deceit;
They have left off to be wise, to do good.

They devise iniquity upon their bed;
They set themselves in a way that is not good;
They abhor not evil.

Your lovingkindness, YHVH, is in the heavens;
Your faithfulness reaches unto the skies.

Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains;
Your judgments are like the great deep;
<strong>Human (<em>adam</em>) and domesticated animal (<em>beheima</em>) you preserve, YHVH.</strong>

How precious is your lovingkindness, <em>Elohim</em>!
And the children of <em>Adam</em>
take refuge in the shadow of your wings.

They are abundantly satisfied with the fatness of your house;
And you make them drink of the river of your pleasures.

For with you is the fountain of life;
In your light do we see light.

O continue your lovingkindness unto them that know you;
And your righteousness to the upright in heart.

Let not the foot of pride overtake me,
And let not the hand of the wicked drive me away.

There are the workers of iniquity fallen;
They are thrust down, and are not able to rise.

For the Leader. A Psalm. A Song of David. 

Praise waits for you, Elohim, in Tsiyon; 
and unto you the vow is performed. 

You who hears prayer; unto you does all flesh come. 

The tale of iniquities is too heavy for me; 
as for our transgressions, you will pardon them. 

Happy is the one whom you choose and bring near, that they may dwell in your courts; 
may we be satisfied with the goodness of your house, the holy place of your temple! 

With wondrous works do you answer us in righteousness, elo'ah of our salvation; 
You are the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of the far distant seas; 

Who by your strength sets fast the mountains, who are girded about with might; 

Who stills the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves, and the tumult of the peoples; 

So that they that dwell in the uttermost parts stand in awe of your signs; 
You make the outgoings of the morning and evening rejoice. 

You have remembered the earth, and watered her, 
greatly enriching her, with the river of Elohim that is full of water; 
You prepare them corn, for so prepare you her. 

Watering her ridges abundantly, settling down the furrows thereof, 
You makest her soft with showers; 
You bless the growth thereof. 

You crown the year with your goodness; 
and your paths drop fatness. 

The pastures of the wilderness do drop; 
and the hills are girded with joy. 

The meadows are clothed with flocks; 
the valleys also are covered over with corn; 
they shout for joy, yea, they sing.

In rabbinic Judaism, the law of <em>tsaar baalei ḥayyim</em> is derived from Genesis 9:4, as interpreted in the Talmud (<em>Sanhedrin</em> 59a). Compassion for animals is declared to have been the merit of Moshe which made him the <em>shepherd</em> of his people (<em>Exodus Rabbah</em> 2), while Yehudah ha-Nasi saw in his own ailment the punishment for having once failed to show compassion for a frightened calf (<em>Bava Metzia</em> 85a). The <em>aggadic</em> (mythic) tradition concerned with the origin of predatory nature in <em>Olam Hazeh</em> (this world) can be found in the Jewish deutero-canonical works of <em>Sefer Ḥanokh</em> (1 Enoch) and <em>Sefer Yubalim</em> (Jubilees) as well as in<em> Midrash Abkir</em> and the collection of rabbinic midrash and midrash aggadah, <em>Yalkut Shimoni</em>.

In Sefer Yubalim (circa 3rd century BCE), the need for circumscribing the predatory nature of humankind after the <em>Dor Hamabul</em> (depraved generation of the Flood) is given as the <em>raison d'etre</em> for the giving of the Torah. As required by the covenant of the Rainbow made to Noaḥ and his descendants after the flood, a representative people was needed who might abide by the general commandment of <em>ever min haḥai</em> (forbidding eating living creatures). In this tradition, Avraham was the first to prove worthy since his actions epitomized <em>ḥesed</em>, lovingkindness (an innovation in Judaism's mytho-historic chronicle of humanity in Genesis). As noted in Rav Shlomo Kluger's HaElef L’cha Shlomo in Yoreh Deah 322, dairy foods, the product of living creatures, were prohibited after the Flood, but this prohibition was relaxed upon the giving of the Torah at Sinai just as the prohibition against eating flesh was relaxed after the covenant at Ararat. For this reason, dairy is a symbolic food eaten on the festival of Shavuot (Pentecost) and remains a symbolic food representing the subversion of predatory nature as reflected in Megillat Yehudith and the dairy food traditions of the festival of Ḥanukkah. (More <a href="http://aharon.varady.net/omphalos/2010/05/happy-vegetarian-shavuot">here</a>.)

<hr />

The text of this ritual shofar blowing for Rosh Ḥodesh Elul and Rosh Hashanah La'behemot developed as part of the annual ceremony taking place at the dairy barn on the campus of the Isabella Freedman Retreat Center beginning in 2009 under the auspices of Elat Chayyim and the Adamah Jewish Farming Fellowship. The ceremony was co-developed by Rabbi Jill Hammer and Sarah Chandler in 2009, with elements added by Aharon Varady beginning in 2012.
