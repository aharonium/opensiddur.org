<hr />

This is an English translation of the Torah reading for Parashat Bereshit (Genesis 1:1-6:8), transtropilized. (Transtropilation is the term coined by Len Fellman to describe the process of translating from cantillized Hebrew, as closely as possible, “word for word and trope for trope”, with the main purpose being to aid a person with minimal Hebrew training in following the Hebrew leyning word for word.) This translation is based on Everett Fox's Five Books of Moses (Schocken 1997) with modifications based on the following translations: Aryeh Kaplan's ‘The Living Torah’, the Stone Edition Tanakh, the Artscroll Machzor, and the Jerusalem Bible.
