O Lord, Creator of all beginnings: We thank You for the opportunity of starting anew. Today those whom we have chosen to lead our country — President Nixon and Vice President Spiro Agnew — pledge again their commitment to serve You and this great and blessed Nation. Grant them the wisdom to understand their true task; the courage to pursue it; and the health and vigor to persist in it.

O Lord, source of all peace: We ask You with all our hearts that we be granted peace, for which we all yearn. Bless us and our leaders with harmony, vision, and strength of purpose so that we may better fulfill our responsibilities to You and to our fellow man. Bring us nearer to You and thus closer to each other — for next to being Your children our greatest privilege is that we are brothers of each other.

On this historic occasion we praise You in ancient words of blessing:
