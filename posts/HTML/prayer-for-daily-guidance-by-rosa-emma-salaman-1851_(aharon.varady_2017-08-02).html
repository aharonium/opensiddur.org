Rosa Emma Salaman's “Prayer for Daily Guidance” was written December 20, 1851 and <a href="http://www.jewish-history.com/occident/volume10/may1852/prayer.html">published in the <em>Occident</em></a> 10:2, Iyar 5612/May 1852, p. 85. 226. Introducing the prayer, Isaac Leeser wrote:

<blockquote>In our last volume, we gave two short prayers by our esteemed friend, Rosa, whose productions we hope to present yet more frequently in our pages. Since then we have received the subjoined, which, we doubt not, will interest our readers as much as it has done us. We still en­tertain the opinion, expressed in our article, vol. ix., pp. 253-5, that we Israelites need devotional exercises in addition to the contents of the prayer-book adapted to the wants of the lonely heart, especially of the female when she is watching, perchance, by the bedside of a dearly beloved object stricken down by the hand of sickness, or when she is surrounded in the busy world by those who feel not with her, and heed not the breathings of faith which animate her innermost spirit. It is therefore that we shall welcome any contributions to our literature which shall fill this void, even in a small degree, and we shall deem him worthy of being called a benefactor of our people, who shall succeed in indicting petitions which shall, as occasional exercises, be able to be placed alongside of those ennobling prayers composed by our ancients, though we confess that we despair of ever seeing this idea realized in its fullest extent.</blockquote>
