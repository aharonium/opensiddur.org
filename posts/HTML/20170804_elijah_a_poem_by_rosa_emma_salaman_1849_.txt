“But he (Elijah) himself went a day’s journey in the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree; and he requested for himself that he might die, and said, It is enough; now, O Lord, take away my life, for I am not better than my fathers. And, as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel touched him; and said unto him, Arise, and eat. And he looked, and behold, there was a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse of water at his head, and he did eat and drink, and laid him down again. And the angel of the Lord came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise, and eat, because the journey is too great for thee.” (1 Kings 19:4-7)

There is no spot so sacred, none so blest, 
As that whereon the holy people rest. 
In grief Elijah laid his weary head 
Beneath a tree; when near his lonely bed 
A beauteous presence stands, whose radiant form, 
Like a bright rainbow after heavy storm, 
Betokens peace; so, most serenely bright, 
His soul is touched with pure, benignant light.

Beloved of God! thou dost not comprehend

“The Lord is God,” and none but He above; 
Like thee, Elijah, was oppressed by foes, 
With none but God to cling to in his woes; 
Like thee, he was discouraged and distressed, 
But with His faith, like him thou wouldst he blest. 
Oh, wondrous faith! when earth and heaven are thine, 
When barren rocks and caves with beauty shine!

Elijah rose; again erect he stands, 
And eats the food prepared by angels’ hands; 
With heavenly might imbued, he walks along, 
And sighs are changed to most melodious song. 
How wonderful God’s dealings with his own! 
That “still, small voice,” that most angelic tone, 
Seemed to Elijah too divinely sweet 
To sound on earth, for mortal ear to meet.

He hides his face; but ah! not yet is come 
That glorious transit to the prophet’s home. 
O child of God! afflicted, think of this, 
A day awaits thee, ‘tis a day of bliss, 
When God decides if earth or heaven shall be 
The fittest place of happiness for thee.
A thousand chariots at his bidding rise 
To bear thee up in triumph to the skies; 
A thousand “ministers of flaming fire,”[foot]Psalms 4:4[/foot] 
Who wing their way through heaven at his desire. 
See, where it comes, the fiery coursers fly, 
The gorgeous car is riding through the sky; 
His angels, breathless, stand and take their post, 
To greet Elijah ‘mongst the heavenly host. 
Hark! ’tis shout of triumph! glory shone 
A momentary blaze, and he is gone!
