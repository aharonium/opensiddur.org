In Leviticus we read that in ancient days:
  new trees were kept un-harvested for three years; 
  fruits of four-year-old trees were set aside as gifts to God; 
  we consumed tree fruits only starting in the fifth year.
Talmud evolved Tu BiShvat as the birthday of all trees to help fulfill these traditions.
Today, we honor Tu BiShvat to renew our spirits and prepare ourselves, and the world, for spring’s arrival.

Tree of life

Tradition teaches that Torah is “a tree of life to all who hold fast” (Proverbs 3:17-18), and that God and Torah (and we) are One (Zohar) … 
… so perhaps we can imagine – like the kabbalists of Tzfat before us – that the creative force of nature is like a tree …
… with roots in creation and branches spreading far and wide ….
Today we invoke this spirit of the Tree of Life.

Repair

The kabbalists created the seder of Tu BiShvat 
as a “tikkun” — a ritual of repair.  
By eating fruits and nuts with mindfulness, 
we strive to repair our own spiritual brokenness 
and the brokenness of a world which is not yet 
as we and God most wish it to be.

The sap begins to rise
  
In Hebrew, the word for sap is saraf, which means fire. The Hebrew month of Shvat is a time to warm the world, and Tu BiShvat is a day to welcome and honor the sap – the water in trees that allows life to return. Tu BiShvat represents the rising life force as our year moves toward spring.

On this day, says tradition, sap begins to rise from the ground, and trees begin to nourish themselves to bloom anew.

What spiritual sap do you yearn to see rising in you? For what new growth do you hope as spring approaches?

Preparation  (by Marge Piercy)

It is the New Year of the Trees, but here
the ground is frozen under the crust of snow.
The trees snooze, their buds tight as nuts.
Rhododendron leaves roll up their stiff scrolls.

In the white and green north of the diaspora
I am stirred by a season that will not arrive
for six weeks, as wines on far continents prickle
to bubbles when their native vines bloom.

What blossoms here are birds jostling
at feeders, picking sunflower seeds
and millet through the snow: tulip red
cardinal, daffodil finch, larkspur jay

the pansybed of sparrows and juncos, all hungry.
They too are planters of trees, spreading seeds
of favorites along fences. On the earth closed
to us all a book in a language we cannot yet read

the seeds, the bulbs, the eggs
of the fervid green year await release.
Over them on February’s cold table I spread
a feast. Wings rustle like summer leaves.

When reciting a blessing...

A person should intend [on Tu BiShvat], when reciting a blessing, 
to channel divine life-energy to all creations and creatures – 
inanimate, plant, animal and human.  
Believe with perfect faith that God gives life to them all, 
that there is a spark of divine life in everything – 
giving it existence, enlivening it, causing it to grow.[foot]Quoted in Yitzhak Buxbaum, <em>A Person is Like a Tree: A Sourcebook for Tu BeShvat</em> (Rowman & Littlefield, 2000) p.26, see footnote 25: "<em>Beit Yisrael,</em> <em>Emet LeYaakov</em>, p. 76 (38b); <em>Tehillah LeDavid</em>, p. 142; <em>Sefarim Kedoshim</em>: <em>Seder Hamisha Asar BeShvat</em>, quoting <em>Orot Yisrael</em>; <em>Ilana DeHayyei</em>, p. 64, #57, quoting <em>Emet LeYaakov</em>."[/foot]

2-minute meditation: spark

Close your eyes. Feel the spark of spirit that burns deep within you.
Cup your hands around that light.

What do you want to illuminate with that light as spring draws near?

Essence

Atzilut is the world of spirit or essence. 
Some choose to savor a spoonful of maple syrup at this moment in the seder: the concentrated essence of the maple tree.
Others choose a sip of etrog spirits, made with the fragrant peels from last autumn’s Sukkot.
If you opt for one of these, a blessing follows...

Taste and see

Psalm 34:8: "Taste & see that God is good."

We make our way into the woods
alongside the road, trees webbed
with plastic tubing, clear
and pale green against the snow.

Down to the beaver dam, pond
punctuated with cattails,
galvanized tin bright
against grizzled trunks.

Dip a finger beneath the living spigot.
At every sugar shack across the hills
clouds of fragrant steam billow.
And after long boiling, this amber...

Where I grew up, the air is soft
already, begonias thinking
about blooming. Here, this
is what rises, hidden and sweet.

-- Rabbi Rachel Barenblat

Secret blessing of the heart

In the world of atzilut we eat no fruit,  for the world of essence cannot be represented...
In this spiritual world, we become aware  of divine love, mercy, and wisdom 
Perceived with our hearts, not our physical senses – achieving an inner vision that, at last, can see the sap rise.
We can speak, at last, the secret blessing of the heart.

A Prayer of Reb Nachman of Bratzlav

Master of the Universe, grant me the ability to be alone. May it be my custom to go outdoors each day among the trees and grass, among all growing things, and there may I be alone, and enter into prayer, to talk with the One to whom I belong.

May I express there everything in my heart, and may all the foliage of the field — all grasses, trees, and plants — awake at my coming, to send the powers of their life into the words of my prayer so that my prayer and speech are made whole through the life and spirit of all growing things, which are made as one by their transcendent Source.

May I then pour out my heart before your Presence like water, O Lord!

May it be Your will, O God of our ancestors, that through our eating of the fruits You have created, the trees be filled with the glory of their ability to renew themselves for new blossoming, from the start of the year to its end, so that our lives too will be renewed and filled with goodness, blessings, and peace.
And we say together: AMEN.

A tale of Honi

One day Honi was journeying and he saw a man planting a carob tree. He asked, "How long does it take for this tree to bear fruit?" The man replied: "Seventy years." Honi asked him: "Are you certain that you will live another seventy years?" The man replied: "I found carob trees in the world; as my forefathers planted those for me, so I plant for my children."

In order to grow

When fruit trees are pruned, they receive
 more sunlight and bear more fruit.

What do you need to prune away 
in order to become more fruitful?

What structures do you need 
in order to sink your roots deep & grow?

What can you build that will support growth
so the world can be better-nourished?

Share your answers aloud with a neighbor.

Closing words of wisdom

God led Adam around the Garden of Eden and said, 
“Look at My works. See how beautiful they are, how excellent! 
For your sake I created them all. 
See to it that you do not spoil or destroy My world — 
for if you do, there will be no one 
to repair it after you.”  (Ecclesiastes Rabbah 7:13)
