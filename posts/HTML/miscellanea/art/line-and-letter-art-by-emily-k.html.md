This image is a literal representation of the phrase "Shield of Ancestors" – the names of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs outline a Magen David, forming a literal shield. The calligraphy style is my own invention, which I've dubbed "Sabra Script" since the letters are drawn in imitation of the tzabar or sabra cactus. [/caption]

This ontomorphic calligraphic image is the phrase "מי כמכה / Mi Chamocha" written in the form of the parted Sea of Reeds. "Mi Chamocha" is of course the opening line to the Song of the Sea, where Miriam the prophetess leads the Israelites in celebration of the Exodus. [/caption]

Featuring 2 versions of the Shema creed – one with vowel markings and one without. Both are written in my original "Sabra Script," so named because it imitates the look of the tzabar or sabra cactus.[/caption]

The word "עליה / Aliyah" is repeated thrice and arcs above the scroll.[/caption]
