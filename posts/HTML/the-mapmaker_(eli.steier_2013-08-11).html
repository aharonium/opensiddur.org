<hr />

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Cold facts.
Colder realities.
The preacher who lost his way
The librarian who empties the shelves
The cook without a spoon
The child masking as a king
The king masking as a child.
The mapmaker studies them all
Furrowing his brow tightly
Crafting lines delicately.
Charges
Nothing
And
Changes
Everything</p>
