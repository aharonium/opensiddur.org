There are four Rosh HaShanahs. 
The first of <em>Nissan</em> is the Rosh HaShanah for kings and pilgrimage holidays. 
The first of <em>Elul</em> is the Rosh HaShanah for tithing <em>beheima</em>. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon say, “The first of Tishray.” 
The first of <em>Tishray</em> is the Rosh HaShanah for years, Shmitah, Yovel, for planting and for vegetables. 
The first of <em>Shvat</em> is the Rosh HaShanah for [fruit-bearing] trees, according to Beit Shamai. Beit Hillel says it is on the fifteenth [of the month of Shvat, Tu biShvat].

<div class="english">
Rosh Ḥodesh Elul, the new moon festival of Elul, also marks one of the four New Year festivals recorded in the Mishnah -- the New Years day for <em>ma'aser beheima</em> -- the tithing of domesticated animals. <em>Rosh Hashanah La'behemot</em> parallels <em>Rosh Hashanah L'Ilanot</em> (Tu BiShvat), the day for tithing fruit bearing trees -- the day on which ribbons were tied around the buds of almond trees indicating which would be its first fruits. These two annual census were essential for upholding the institution of the Temple and the caste of families serving as its priests. 

In the millenia after the Temple's destruction, Tu biShvat was re-established by Jewish mystics as a special day of <em>tikkun</em> -- a day to reflect on and pray for healing our relationship with trees and by extension, the whole of life-nurturing Earth. Similarly, Rosh Ḥodesh Elul begins in earnest a month-long process of <em>teshuva</em> -- an intense <em>tikkun</em> of all of our living relationships, culminating with the New Years Day for Humankind.[foot]The New Years Day for Humankind, follows the tradition that Rosh Hashanah on Rosh Ḥodesh Tishray is the sixth day after the first "day" of creation -- Elul 25.[/foot] 

What a better way to begin a month dedicated to humbling ourselves and repairing our relationships than by reflecting first on our relationship with <em>beheima</em> -- the domesticated animals which depend on us for their care and sustenance. The category of <em>beheima</em> includes all animals historically bred by humans as domesticated creatures, both kosher and non-kosher, e.g. cats and cattle, dogs and donkeys, goats, pigs, chicken, and llamas.[foot]The legal categories of wild and domesticated animals are examined in the Talmud through an animal which contains aspects of both, the "koy".[/foot] If we can imagine, empathize, and understand the dependency of <em>beheima</em> in our care, how much better can we realize our relationship with blessed Holy One, and the infinite chain of inter-dependencies uniting all living relationships in reflection of this Oneness.

Once upon a time when the Temple still stood, the Rosh Hashanah La'behemot celebrated one means by which we elevated and esteemed the special creatures that helped us to live and to work. Just as rabbinic Judaism found new ways to realize our Temple offerings with <em>tefillot</em> -- prayers -- so too the Rosh Hashanah La'behemot challenges us to realize the holiness of the animals in our care in a time without tithes. The New Years Day for Animals is a challenge to remind and rediscover what our responsibilities are to the animals who depend on us for their welfare. Are we treating them correctly and in accord with the mitzvah of <em>tza'ar baalei chayim</em> -- sensitivity to the suffering of living creatures? Have we studied and understood the depth of ḥesed -- lovingkindness -- expressed in the breadth of our ancestors teachings concerning the welfare of animals in Torah? Rosh Hashanah La'behemot is the day to reflect on our immediate or mediated relationships with domesticated animals, recognize our personal responsibilities to them, individually and as part of a distinct and holy people, and repair our relationships to the best of our ability. 

Rosh Hashanah La'behemot is a day to reflect on our responsibilities and relationships with <em>beheima</em> and perhaps, by extension <em>ḥayot</em> -- non-domesticated or wild animals, as well. In the story of Noaḥ, the activity of humankind was such that the survival of all creatures on Earth were disrupted and ultimately depended directly on <em>Bnei Adam</em> (the children of Adam) for their survival. Today, our massive disruption to the land resources and food web of <em>ḥayot</em>, certainly places a certain onus of responsibility on us -- a responsibility we are reminded to heed with the sounding of the horn of a ram, the shofar, on Rosh Ḥodesh Elul.

There is a longstanding <em>minhag</em> (tradition) to check one's <em>mezuzot</em> during the month of Elul. Being mindful that we rely on the skins of animals to prepare our <em>mezuzot</em> upon which the Shema is written, is perhaps the first step to becoming sensitive to our relationship with other creatures. Even if we don't perceive an immediate and personal relationship with non-human animals, we still have a precious and holy connection with them. Reappraising our relationship with these creatures that ultimately depend on us for their care and survival is the first step towards understanding the essential relationship which ensures our own survival, as individuals for the coming year, and as a people on this Earth.

<h3>Liturgy</h3>

<div class="english">Given the valence of <em>teshuvah</em> on Rosh Ḥodesh Elul and the major theme of Rosh Hashanah La'behemot, R' Dalia Marx recommends Psalms 36 for its reference in verse 7 to the blessed Holy One saving all creatures: "<span class="hebrew" lang="he">אדם ובהמה תושיע ה׳</span>."</div>

Psalms 36[foot]Psalm 36 translation from the 1917 JPS Tanakh, with minor adaptations by Aharon Varady[/foot]

For the Leader. [A Psalm] of David the servant of YHVH. 

Transgression speaks to the wicked, methinks— 
There is no fear of God before their eyes. 

For it flatters them in their eyes, 
Until their iniquity is found, and they be hated. 

The words of their mouth are iniquity and deceit; 
They have left off to be wise, to do good. 

They devise iniquity upon their bed; 
They set themselves in a way that is not good; 
They abhor not evil. 

Your lovingkindness, YHVH, is in the heavens; 
Your faithfulness reaches unto the skies. 

Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains; 
Your judgments are like the great deep; 
<em>Adam</em> and <em>beheima</em> you preserve, YHVH. 

How precious is your lovingkindness, <em>Elohim</em>! 
And the children of <em>Adam</em> take refuge in the shadow of your wings. 

They are abundantly satisfied with the fatness of your house; 
And you make them drink of the river of your pleasures. 

For with you is the fountain of life; 
In your light do we see light. 

O continue your lovingkindness unto them that know you; 
And your righteousness to the upright in heart. 

Let not the foot of pride overtake me, 
And let not the hand of the wicked drive me away. 

There are the workers of iniquity fallen; 
They are thrust down, and are not able to rise.

For the Leader. A Psalm. A Song of David. 

Praise waits for you, Elohim, in Tsiyon; 
and unto you the vow is performed. 

You who hears prayer; unto you does all flesh come. 

The tale of iniquities is too heavy for me; 
as for our transgressions, you will pardon them. 

Happy is the one whom you choose and bring near, that they may dwell in your courts; 
may we be satisfied with the goodness of your house, the holy place of your temple! 

With wondrous works do you answer us in righteousness, elo'ah of our salvation; 
You are the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of the far distant seas; 

Who by your strength sets fast the mountains, who are girded about with might; 

Who stills the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves, and the tumult of the peoples; 

So that they that dwell in the uttermost parts stand in awe of your signs; 
You make the outgoings of the morning and evening rejoice. 

You have remembered the earth, and watered her, 
greatly enriching her, with the river of Elohim that is full of water; 
You prepare them corn, for so prepare you her. 

Watering her ridges abundantly, settling down the furrows thereof, 
You make her soft with showers; 
You bless the growth thereof. 

You crown the year with your goodness; 
and your paths drop fatness. 

The pastures of the wilderness do drop; 
and the hills are girded with joy. 

The meadows are clothed with flocks; 
the valleys also are covered over with corn; 
they shout for joy, yea, they sing.

<h3>Ritual</h3>

The one prominent custom on Rosh Hodesh Elul is the blowing of the shofar at the end of Shacharit. At <a href="http://telshemesh.org/av/#articles">Tel Shemesh</a>, Rabbi Jill Hammer adopts this custom in crafting a ritual specific to Rosh Hashanah La'behemot.

<blockquote>The first of Elul, according to the Talmud, is the new year for animals—the time when farmers counted all of their animals a year older for purposes of tithing.[foot]Babylonian Talmud, Rosh haShanah 2a.[/foot] Perhaps this was in preparation for the new year of Tishrei, the new year for people—to remind us that animals were created before us. Another explanation: the first of Elul, one month before the first of Tishrei, reminds us that to discover our humans selves fully we must first discover our animal selves—what our instincts are telling us, and whether we are aware of our most basic needs and feelings. Only when we discover these things can we begin to plan for change.

<h3>Blessing of the Animals on the New Moon of Elul by Rabbi Jill Hammer</h3> [foot]First published by Jill Hammer in <a href="http://telshemesh.org/av/two_shofar_rituals_for_the_new_moon_of_elul.html">Two Shofar Rituals for the New Moon of Elul</a>" and first performed in 2010 at Isabella Freedman Retreat Center[/foot]

The new moon of the month of Elul, according to Mishnah Rosh haShanah 1:1, is the new year for the animals, just as the full moon of Shevat is the new year for trees. This ritual celebrates and reflects on the human connection to animals.

(Gather in a place where pets can gather too, or where you can see wildlife. Begin with a <em>niggun</em> or song. You can also begin by invoking the four elements.

Reading:

We have become tyrants on this planet, using its resources for ourselves and driving animals into the corners of the earth. Before we can make amends to one another at the new year, we must first make amends to the vulnerable creatures who live among us. As we hear the cry of the shofar for the first time, may we hear in it the cry of all life. May the One who is the breath of life guide us to protect the earth and make room in it for other creatures to thrive.

(The shofar is blown once, a single tekiyah/blast.)

We are grateful for all the good we get from animals. Some of us eat animals, some wear their skins, some eat eggs and cheese, some use medicines and even organs that come from animals, some wear wool and silk, some write on Torah scrolls, wear <em>tefillin</em>, and blow <em>shofarot</em> that come from animal’s bodies. Some of us do none of these things, but we benefit from the bee that pollinates the flowers and the worm that softens the earth. May the One who is the breath of life cause us to be mindful of these gifts and never to waste them or take them for granted.

(The shofar is blown a second time.)

We bless the creatures we are privileged to live with on the earth: the loving companion animals who live in our houses, the birds at our windows and in the forests, the burrowing creatures under our feet, the fish in the waters of our streams and oceans. May the One who is the breath of life bless all living things that we love and strengthen them.

(Bring forward or turn toward any creatures you wish to bless. Recite the blessing over seeing unique creatures.)
