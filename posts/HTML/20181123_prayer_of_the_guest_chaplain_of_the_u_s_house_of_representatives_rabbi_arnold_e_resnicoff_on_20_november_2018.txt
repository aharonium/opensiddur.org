We condemned the false belief 
that any humans are less than human: 
"life unworthy of life."[foot]The phrase "life unworthy of life" (in German: "Lebensunwertes Leben") was a Nazi designation for the segments of the populace which, according to the Nazi regime of the time, had no right to live.

Such thinking leads to slaughter, 
even here at home: 
dead children in their churches, 
hated for the color of their skin; 
beatings, killings, lynchings 
that stained our landscape, 
and our history, 
with what poets called 
the strange and bitter fruit of bodies hanging from the trees;[foot]"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Fruit">Strange Fruit</a>" by Abel Meeropol (1937), famously sung by Billie Holiday in 1939.[/foot]
and last month, 
in a Pittsburgh synagogue, 
men and women murdered 
because the shooter thought "all Jews should die."[foot]Sheehan, Andy; Schiller, Meghan (October 27, 2018).

Police sources tell KDKA’s Andy Sheehan the gunman, Robert Bowers, walked into the building and yelled, “All Jews must die.” Sheehan’s sources also confirmed that eleven people have died.[/foot]

God, 
we know that words and prayers still matter,

that all are created equal,[foot]Cf. "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_men_are_created_equal">All men are created equal</a>" -- Thomas Jefferson in the United States Declaration of Independence[/foot]

rights and dreams we must forever honor, cherish, and protect.
