The goal of this project was to produce a complete prayerbooklet for the Friday night Kabbalat Shabbat and Ma'ariv service that was as compact as possible yet user-friendly. This booklet is designed to be printed on 9 double-sided sheets of paper, folded and saddle stapled. It was commissioned for a minyan held annually at the <a href="http://www.arisia.org">Arisia science fiction convention</a> in Boston, MA, and dedicated in honor of Leonard Nimoy, z"l (1931–2015). Since <a href="http://www.arisia.org">Arisia</a> takes place in mid-January, we omitted all special insertions for holidays and other times of year. A companion booklet which includes insertions for year-round use is in the works.
