<blockquote>
<h3>One Minute Speech Given in Recognition of the Guest Chaplain:</h3>
Ms. GRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to thank Rabbi Jay Weinstein for delivering this morning's invocation.

Rabbi Weinstein is a native of Miami Beach, Florida. He received his ordination from Yeshiva University. He is now rabbi at Young Israel of East Brunswick, New Jersey, which serves more than 220 families.

I also want to recognize Rabbi Weinstein's parents, Stanley and Lenore, his wife, Sharon, and his four wonderful children, one of whom, Ora, is here with me on the floor today.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud to live in a Nation where we open our doors and our hearts to invite leaders of all different faiths to offer a blessing. I am very thankful to Rabbi Weinstein for offering such an incredibly meaningful prayer this morning.
