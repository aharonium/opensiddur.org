 Who cannot see the suffering
 Behind the loss of that compassion.

 To resist the urge to inhumanity
 That we feel in times of fear and mourning.
 We pray for the courage
 To resist the calls to inhumanity
 That others may make upon us in times of crisis.

 Blessed One-ness, Blessed Connection,

 May we find relief from our hurts and fears
 And may we not, in our pain,
 Lose our empathy
 For the hurts and fears of others.
 We pray for all who are in pain
 And all who cause pain.
 Amen

"A Prayer for Suffering," was subsequently discovered by writers from the NBC mini-series A.D. The Bible Continues (s01e04) and included without attribution or adoption of the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license under which the prayer was shared. After this matter was raised with the network, the sequence in which the prayer appeared was removed from the episode of the show.
