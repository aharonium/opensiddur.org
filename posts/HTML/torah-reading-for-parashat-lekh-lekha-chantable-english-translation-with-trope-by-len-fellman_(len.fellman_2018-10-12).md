<hr />

This is an English translation of Genesis 12:1-17:27, the Torah reading for Parashat Lekh Lekha, transtropilized. (Transtropilation is the term coined by Len Fellman to describe the process of translating from cantillized Hebrew, as closely as possible, “word for word and <em>trōp</em> for <em>trōp</em>”, with the main purpose being to aid a person with minimal Hebrew training in following the Hebrew leyning word for word.) This translation is based on Everett Fox's The Five of Moses (Schocken 1997) with modifications based on the following translations: Aryeh Kaplan ‘The Living Torah’, the Stone Edition Tanach, The Artscroll Machzor, and The Jerusalem Bible.
