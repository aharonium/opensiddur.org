Celebrate Ḥanukkah with a Psychedelic Hebrew Animation from <a href="http://darshanproject.com">Darshan</a>!

It's that time of the year again: menorahs, dreidels, and of course, psychedelic ḥamsas. Wait, is that a thing? Brush up on your aleph-bet as you travel through time and space in "Aleph Bass," this crazy language-learning video. From filmmakers Brian Savelson and Abbey Luck, and the musical maestros of Darshan (Eden Pearlstein and Shir Yaakov Feit), this trip includes Kabbalistic mysticism and super sick beats. Guaranteed, you've never seen anything quite like it.

RAP LYRICS:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Letters are the building blocks of all of God's creation
Kabbalistic keys unlock the heart of human nature
Metaphysic molecules of mystic nomenclature
Torah is the Tree of Life in musical notation</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Speaking into being, existential occupation
For servants of the Source of Light and Root of Revelation
Reading into meaning, covenantal calibration
For students on the path of learning language liberation</p>
