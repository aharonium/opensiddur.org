<blockquote>
Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, it is a real pleasure to welcome a special guest to our House from Miami, Florida, who shared her message of prayer and inspiration with us today, Rabbi Joui Hessel. We are happy to have the Rabbi and her wonderful family, who reside in my congressional district in Miami, Florida, with us here today.

Rabbi Hessel was ordained from the Hebrew Union College Jewish Institute of Religion in New York in 2001. While in Rabbinical School in New York, she served several congregations and also served as the Education Intern at Leo Bacck Temple in Los Angeles, California.

Rabbi Hessel is currently serving at the Washington Hebrew Congregation right here in Washington, D.C., as associate Rabbi. She has been in that capacity since June of 2001 and is active in many programs, including youth activities and adult education. The Rabbi is currently working on an educational article for a book on Parenting Young Adult Children.

Thank you, Rabbi Joui Hessel, for your spiritual leadership and for your prayers and for having such wonderful parents, who are my constituents.
