<h3>One Minute Speech Given in Recognition of the Guest Chaplain:</h3>

Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I was running in late. I am devastated that I missed the prayer by Rabbi Cheryl Jacobs, from Broward County, FL. I am honored to have her here. I was at a Banking Committee hearing and could not make it on time.

Rabbi Jacobs does an amazing amount of work in the Broward County area, helping people in need in all walks of life. She is always there to help. I am tremendously honored to have her here today. We are pleased that she was able to honor us with her prayer. We thank her for coming.

Dear God, 
what do I desire for my country? 
How do I vision the land I love? 
Let it be a land 
where knowledge is free, 
where the mind is without fear 
and men and women hold their heads high, 
where words come out 
from the depths of truth, 
where our leaders have the courage 
and the permission 
to lead, 
where Americans have faith 
in our land, 
in our leaders, 
and in themselves.
