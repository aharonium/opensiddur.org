In their divinely inspired wisdom, 
the Founding Fathers of our blessed country, 
the United States of America, 
established a policy of separation 
of church and state. 
However, it was never their intention 
to separate our country from You, 
sovereign ruler of all mankind. 
Hence, both legislative bodies of our blessed country 
begin their sessions 
invoking Your divine presence 
and guidance in their legislation. 
Hence, in our Pledge of Allegiance 
we declare "one Nation under God,'' 
on our currency is printed "In God We Trust,'' 
and on the walls of this very Senate hall 
in which we invoke Your blessing 
is engraved in bold letters "In God We Trust.''

Grant, Almighty God,
that the Senators realize 
that in legislating just laws 
they are fulfilling one of the seven commandments[foot]Sanhedrin 56a; cf. Tosefta Avodah Zarah 8:4 and Genesis Rabbah 34:8. Six items were commanded to Adam: concerning idolatry, blasphemy, bloodshed, illicit sexuality, theft, and laws…God added to Noah, the law of not eating from the flesh of a live animal.” (Maimonides, Laws of Kings 9:1). The impetus behind sharing the sheva mitsvot in the context of ḤaBaD Lubavitch originates with the following teaching of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson: "We must do everything possible to ensure that the seven Noahide laws are observed. If this can be accomplished through force or through other kinder and more peaceful means through explaining to non-Jews that they should accept God’s wishes [we should do so]…Anyone who is able to influence a non-Jew in any way to keep the seven commandments is obligated to do so, since that is what God commanded Moses our teacher," (“Sheva Mitzvot Shel Benai Noach,” Hapardes 59:9 7-11, 5745).[/foot]&nbsp; 
which You issued to Noah and his family 
after the great flood 
as related in the book of Genesis and its sacred commentaries--
the command that every society 
govern by just laws.

Almighty God, 
I beseech You today 
to bless the Senate 
in the merit of one of the spiritual giants 
of our time and our Nation,
the Lubavitcher Rebbe, 
Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson of saintly blessed memory, 
who passed away 19 years ago today. 
The Rebbe labored with great love, 
dedication, 
and self-sacrifice 
to make all mankind aware 
of Your sacred presence.
