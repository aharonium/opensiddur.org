Guest Chaplain: Rabbi Shea Harlig, Chabad of Southern Nevada
Sponsor: Senator Harry Reid, (D-NV)
Date of Prayer: 06/25/2009

<blockquote>
<h3>One Minute Speech Given in Recognition of the Guest Chaplain:</h3>

Mr. REID. Madam President, with the Senate Chaplain, Admiral Black, standing by, we all listened to a prayer from one of our Jewish brethren in Las Vegas, Rabbi Harlig. I am sure the Chaplain was pleased with the prayer. Those of us in attendance were pleased with the prayer. It was a meaningful, wonderful prayer for our Senate and the country. So I welcome Rabbi Harlig and thank him for helping us open the Senate with the beautiful prayer he uttered.

Rabbi Harlig and his wife Dina breathed new life into the southern Nevada Jewish community when they opened a Chabad center in their living room in 1990. It has grown dramatically since then, and successfully grown, and there are now five such community centers in southern Nevada. The organization Rabbi Harlig founded has taught so many children and adults and has done so many mitzvot--or good deeds--for so many people.

As Rabbi Harlig mentioned in his invocation, today is significant for the Chabad community because it is the day of the passing of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, one of the great Jewish leaders of our time.

So thank you, Rabbi Harlig, for joining us in the Senate today.

Almighty G-d, 
the Members of this prestigious body, the U.S. Senate, 
convene here in the spirit of one of the seven Noahide Laws[foot]Sanhedrin 56a; cf. Tosefta Avodah Zarah 8:4 and Genesis Rabbah 34:8. Six items were commanded to Adam: concerning idolatry, blasphemy, bloodshed, illicit sexuality, theft, and laws…God added to Noah, the law of not eating from the flesh of a live animal.” (Maimonides, Laws of Kings 9:1). The impetus behind sharing the sheva mitsvot in the context of ḤaBaD Lubavitch originates with the following teaching of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson: "We must do everything possible to ensure that the seven Noahide laws are observed. If this can be accomplished through force or through other kinder and more peaceful means through explaining to non-Jews that they should accept God’s wishes [we should do so]…Anyone who is able to influence a non-Jew in any way to keep the seven commandments is obligated to do so, since that is what God commanded Moses our teacher," (“Sheva Mitzvot Shel Benai Noach,” Hapardes 59:9 7-11, 5745).[/foot]&nbsp; 
which were set forth by You 
as an eternal universal code of ethics 
for all mankind; 
that every society be governed by just laws 
which shall be based in the recognition of You, O G-d, 
as the Sovereign Ruler of all peoples 
and all nations. 
We, 
the citizens of this blessed country, 
proudly proclaim this recognition 
and our commitment to justice in our Pledge of Allegiance--
"One Nation, 
under G-d, 
with liberty 
and justice 
for all."
