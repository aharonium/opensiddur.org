The Rebbe reached out

regardless of race,

The Rebbe said

The Rebbe also encouraged the observance 
of the Seven Noaḥide Laws,[foot]Sanhedrin 56a; cf. Tosefta Avodah Zarah 8:4 and Genesis Rabbah 34:8. Six items were commanded to Adam: concerning idolatry, blasphemy, bloodshed, illicit sexuality, theft, and laws…God added to Noah, the law of not eating from the flesh of a live animal.” (Maimonides, Laws of Kings 9:1). The impetus behind sharing the sheva mitsvot in the context of ḤaBaD Lubavitch originates with the following teaching of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson: "We must do everything possible to ensure that the seven Noahide laws are observed. If this can be accomplished through force or through other kinder and more peaceful means through explaining to non-Jews that they should accept God’s wishes [we should do so]…Anyone who is able to influence a non-Jew in any way to keep the seven commandments is obligated to do so, since that is what God commanded Moses our teacher," (“Sheva Mitzvot Shel Benai Noach,” Hapardes 59:9 7-11, 5745).[/foot]&nbsp; 
or the Seven Universal Laws, 
which are the basis 
of any decent 
and civilized 
society.

In the merit of the Rebbe, 
we ask You, Almighty God, 
to bestow Your blessings 
on the Members of the Senate 
and their families 
and through them 
on all the people in the United States of America 
for peace, 
contentment, 
and fulfillment 
in all their endeavors, 
in joy, 
in happiness, 
and in gladness of heart.
