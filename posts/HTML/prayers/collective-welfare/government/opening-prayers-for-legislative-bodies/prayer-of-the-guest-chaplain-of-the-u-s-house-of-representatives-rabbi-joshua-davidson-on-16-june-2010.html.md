<h3>One Minute Speech Given in Recognition of the Guest Chaplain:</h3>

Mr. HALL of New York. I am pleased to welcome Rabbi Joshua Davidson, Senior Rabbi of Temple Beth El in Northern Westchester, New York, as our guest chaplain in the House today. Rabbi Davidson is joined here today by his wife, Mia; their daughter, Mikaela; his aunt, Greer Goldman; and his in–laws, Carol and David Fram. 

Rabbi Davidson is president of the Westchester Board of Rabbis. He has served Temple Beth El since 2002, and before that served at the Central Synagogue in New York City. He has a long, distinguished career, serving on the boards of many charitable organizations, interfaith coalitions, and prestigious Jewish organizations. 

He served as the chair of the Central Conference of the American Rabbis' Committee on Justice, Peace, and Religious Liberties, vice chair of the Commission on Social Action of Reform Judaism. He currently chairs the commission's task force on Israel and World Affairs. Rabbi Davidson is a member of the Hebrew Union College President's Rabbinic Council, and serves on the Clergy Advisory Board of Interfaith Impact of New York State. 

House chaplains are a long, proud tradition in the House of Representatives, dating back to the time of our Founding Fathers, and Rabbi Davidson is a worthy entry into the long roll of distinguished guests.

In this great hall where dreams come true,

to lift up those in this land 
and in all lands 
who cannot stand on their own.
