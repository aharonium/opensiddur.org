When Faith, too young for a sublimer creed, 
Her simple text from Nature's volume taught, 
She 'wakened Melody, whose shell and reed-- 
Though rude, upon her spirit gently wrought. 
But soon from sylvan altars she took wing, 
And music followed still the Angel's flight; 
Savage no more, she touched a golden string, 
And sung of God, in Revelation's light!
Lend, lend our chords, ye seraph-pair, 
The soul of Jesse's Son,[foot]King David, son of Yishai.[/foot]
That we may in harmonious prayer, 
Exalt the Holy One!

Girt in His lightning robe, God gave the Law. 
From trembling Sinai, to His eldest-born; 
Tablets, that time from memory could not draw, 
A talisman in Judah's bosom worn. 
His spirit before thousands past, 
To <em>one</em> alone revealed; 
And 'mid the thunder's awful blast, 
Faith's covenant was sealed.

"Him first, him last," him ever let us sing, 
Whose promise yet the Hebrew pilgrim cheers; 
Who shall his wandering people once more bring, 
Back to the glory of departed years. 
Bright pillar of our desert path, 
Through shame and scorn adored; 
Thy mercy triumph's o'er thy wrath, 
Creator, King, and Lord!

Lost is the pomp, that in the land of palms, 
Thy regal temple on Moriah graced; 
No wreathing incense <em>here</em> Thy shrine embalms, 
No cherub-plumes are round its altars placed. 
Our censer is the "vital urn," 
Our ark's upborne by zeal; 
To these Almighty! wilt thou turn--
At Israel's appeal.

Now, let joyous hallelujah's ring, 
The <em>fallen</em> casts her ashes far away; 
Behold another Fane from ruin spring, 
In brighter and more beautiful array. 
Enter in brotherly accord 
God's holy dwelling-place; 
Chastened in spirit and in word, 
There supplicate His grace.

Hear, Supreme! our humble invocation; 
Our country, kindred, and the stranger bless! 
Bless, too, this sanctuary's consecration, 
Its hallowed purpose on our hearts impress, 
Still, still let choral harmony, 
Ascend before Thy throne; 
While echoing seraphim reply 
The Lord our God is One!
