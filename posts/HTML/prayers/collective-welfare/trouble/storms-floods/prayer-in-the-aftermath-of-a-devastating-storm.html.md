<em>Elohei haRuchot</em>, God of the Winds,[foot]Numbers 27:16[/foot]
Fixated as we are by incalculable losses in our families, our neighbors,

 we are pummeled into shock, barely even able to call out to You.

We are, as ever, called to share bread with the hungry, 
to take those who suffer into our homes, 
to clothe the naked, 
to not ignore our sisters and brothers.[foot]adapted from Isaiah 58:6-7[/foot]&nbsp;
Many more of our brothers and sisters 
are hungry, homeless, cold, and vulnerable today 
than [they] were just a few days ago, 
and we need Your Help.

We look to the sacred wells of human resilience and compassion 
and ask You for even more strength and hope.
