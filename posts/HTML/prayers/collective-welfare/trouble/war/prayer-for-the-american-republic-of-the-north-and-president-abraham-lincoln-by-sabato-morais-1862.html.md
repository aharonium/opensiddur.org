Author of all good!

We implore Thy almighty protection 
on behalf of the American Republic of the North. 
Let Thine eyes, which never slumber, be open upon her, 
that she may not be erased from among the family of nations. 
Be with her in this struggle for life, 
that she may survive it, and wax greater and happier.

Direct the hands into which 
the temporal welfare of this people is entrusted. 
Sustain them that their strength may never flag. 
Bless the President of the United States: 
bless him for his sterling honesty. 
Bless him for his firmness and moderation. 
Rekindle with joy his domestic heart; 
pour on him the balm of divine consolation. 
Grant that the issues of his momentous obligations 
be a united and prosperous country. 
Grant that the end of his career 
be the maintenance of this Government, 
unimpaired and unsullied 
as bequeathed by our illustrious ancestors.

This prayer by Rabbi Sabato Morais (1828-1897), of Congregation Mikveh Israel in Philadelphia, was authored sometime before 13 May 1862 (the date acknowledged in a letter by its recipient, President Abraham Lincoln). The letter was read into the congressional record on 29 February 1944 by Arthur G. Klein (1904-1968, D-NY) after it was brought to light by Moshe Davis at the 44th annual meeting of the American Jewish Historical Society on 12-13 February 1944 (Lincoln's Birthday).
