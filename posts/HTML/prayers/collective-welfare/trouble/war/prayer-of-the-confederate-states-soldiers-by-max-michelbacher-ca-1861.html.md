Prayers for the welfare of Jewish soldiers and their victory in battle can be found as soon as emancipation led to Jews serving in the armed forces of nations, often against Jews serving other nations. Thus, it is no great surprise to find one offered by a rabbi in the State of Virginia in the capitol of the Confederate States of America. But given that unrepentant revanchist and racist white supremacists continue to celebrate the Confederacy in our own day, often under the guise of "honoring southern pride," we share the text of this prayer only for its historical import and as a cautious lesson. Patriotism born of genuine appreciation for freedom, liberty, and sanctuary granted to some can blind those privileged to the lives and labor stolen from others. Recognizing such depravity where and when it occurs should ground us in every place we dwell. As Emma Lazarus later argued in "<a href="https://jwa.org/media/quote-from-epistle-to-hebrews">An Epistle to the Hebrews</a>" (1883): "Until we are all free, we are none of us free," or as Proverbs 4:14 teaches, "Enter not into the path of the wicked, and walk not in the way of evil men." —Aharon Varady

I supplicate thy forgiveness, 
O most merciful Father, 
for the many transgressions 
and the oft repeated disobedience, 
which cause Thee to command destruction over me. 
Behold me now, O my Father, 
supplicating Thy protection! 
Thou who art near

O spare me, 
guard me from the evil that is impending!

This once happy country is inflamed by the fury of war; 
a menacing enemy is arrayed against the rights, 
liberties and freedom of this, our Confederacy; 
the ambition of this enemy has dissolved fraternal love, 
and the hand of fraternity has been broken asunder 
by the hands of those, 
who sit now in council 
and meditate our chastisement, 
with the chastisement of scorpions. 
Our firesides are threatened; 
the foe is before us, 
with the declared intention 
to desecrate our soil, 
to murder our people, 
and to deprive us of the glorious inheritance 
which was left to us 
by the immortal fathers of this once great Republic.

This "Prayer for of the C.S. Soldiers" was written by Max Michelbacher of Congregation Beth Ahabah, Richmond, Virginia, and distributed to Jewish soldiers in the Confederate armed forces during the Slaveholders' Rebellion (1861-1865). While this prayer is undated, we have tentatively given the date ca. 1861 given the proximity of Richmond, Virginia to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Battle_of_Bull_Run">First Battle of Bull Run</a>. (On 29 May 1861, with the arrival in Richmond, Virginia of Confederate President Jefferson Davis, the Confederate States capital had been moved from Montgomery to Richmond, making it an initial target for what was hoped to be a quick conclusion to the war.) Another prayer was offered by Rabbi Michelbacher for the Confederacy on 27 March 1863.
