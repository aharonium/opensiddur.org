Lord God! 
who didst bless this land with Thy favors, 
restore her, we beseech thee to unity. 
Cancel her iniquities, 
and let her be distinguished anew 
for the virginal purity of her pristine years. 
Grant that charity and truth 
may weave the garland 
that shall adorn her children, 
for, then will righteousness and peace 
be met in her midst 
clasped in each others embrace.

Guide Thou 
the steps which are now wending 
toward the conquest of right, 
that they may not overreach the bounds prescribed. 
Let the mind which a misguided judgment has darkned, 
become penetrated with the light of truth, 
and it will amend its errors.

Oh, Eternal Being, 
who didst rekindle feelings of love 
in the bosom of the fierce son of Isaac, 
breathe into us words of brotherly, reconciliation, 
and let the hand that wields the sword 
be fraternally seized with a mutual grasp.

At this hour, 
when the heart of a whole nation is upheaved to thee, 
calm O Omnipotent! its inward perturbation. 
Regard the prayer, 
which in various strains, 
but in consonance of thoughts, 
is addressed to thee. 
Let the Angel of Mercy present it 
to the Throne of Grace, 
and bring down thy Fatherly blessing 
upon thy suppliants, 
even, honor, union and peace 
for evermore.â€”
<em>Amen</em>.

This prayer by Rabbi Sabato Morais was offered on the day decreed by President Abraham Lincoln for "public humiliation, prayer and fasting" (26 September 1861) as recorded in an "Address. Delivered by the Rev. S. Morais, Minister of the Congregation Mikveh Israel, Philadelphia, on the National 'Fast Day.'" published in <em>The Jewish Messenger</em> on 4 October 1861. It was preserved by Rabbi Morais in <a href="http://sceti.library.upenn.edu/pages/index.cfm?so_id=1661&pageposition=39&level=1">his ledger</a> (page 21, clipping 022), an archive of newsclippings recording material he contributed to the press, among other announcements. The annotation accompanying the clipping reads, "at the breaking out of the unfortunate Civil War."
