Jewish prayers for the welfare of the nations in which they dwell are known from medieval times, and developed further with the emancipation and patriotic expectations of Jewish citizens in modern nation-states. Thus, it is no great surprise to find such a prayer offered by a rabbi in the State of Virginia in the capitol of the Confederate States of America. But given that unrepentant revanchist and racist white supremacists continue to celebrate the Confederacy in our own day, often under the guise of "honoring southern pride," we share the text of this prayer only for its historical import and as a cautious lesson. Patriotism born of genuine appreciation for freedom, liberty, and sanctuary granted to some can blind those privileged to the lives and labor stolen from others. Recognizing such depravity where and when it occurs should ground us in every place we dwell. As Emma Lazarus later argued in "<a href="https://jwa.org/media/quote-from-epistle-to-hebrews">An Epistle to the Hebrews</a>" (1883): "Until we are all free, we are none of us free," or as Proverbs 4:14 teaches, "Enter not into the path of the wicked, and walk not in the way of evil men." —Aharon Varady

to seek it in the midst of dangers,

Then dost see, O Supreme Giver of Good, 
the red and savage hand of massacre 
held with the menace of foreboding evil, 
over the innocent and nursing infants of our people! 
Thou doest see, O Supreme Giver of Good, 
that we are threatened with the destruction of our men, women and children 
by cruel enemies, that laugh and clap their hands at the calamities, 
they desire to bring upon us, 
whereby they may outrage and scoff at Thy Super-Excellent Majesty, 
and say within their hearts that vengeance is theirs and not Thine!

Thou art not silent, nor unmindful of our terrible streights,

neither wilt Thou let come to pass this atrocious thing

Because of Thy strength in aid of us,

because of Thy strength they have failed; 
and, behold, O God, 
they incite our man-servants and maid-servants to insurrection, 
and they place weapons of death and the fire of desolation in their hands, 
that we may become an easy prey unto them; 
they beguile them from the path of duty, 
that they may waylay their masters, 
to assassinate and to slay the men, women and children of the people, 
that trust only in Thee. 
In this wicked thought, let them be frustrated, 
and cause them to fall into the pit of destruction, 
which in the abomination of their evil intents, 
they digged for us, 
our brothers and sisters, 
our wives and our children.
