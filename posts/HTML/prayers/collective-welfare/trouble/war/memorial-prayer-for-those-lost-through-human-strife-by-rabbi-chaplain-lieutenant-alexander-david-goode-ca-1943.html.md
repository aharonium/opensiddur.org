O God, the Creator of life, 
to Whom the bereaved human heart turns for compassion and solace, 
to you we open our hearts, 
sorely stricken by the wanton destruction of life through man's own hand. 
With tender love we recall dear ones lost in the service of their country 
while striving selflessly and bravely 
to remove from us the evil which men have contrived. 
With crushed spirit we remember the countless innocent victims 
whose lives have been ruthlessly cut short 
by men who brazenly defy your laws of truth, justice and love.

Hearken, O merciful One, unto our fervent prayer 
and turn speedily the men of wickedness from their misguided course, 
so that peace may once more rule the courses of men. 
Remove the blindness wherewith lust for power 
has veiled their eyes 
and turned their hearts to stone, 
laying waste your precious gift of life. 
And as for us who still walk in this path of life, 
make us firm in our resolve to pursue righteousness and peace 
so that the sacrifice of these lost ones 
whom we reverently recall this day 
shall not have been in vain. 
May their souls be bound up in the bond of life eternal, O Heavenly Father, 
and may we be found worthy of being inscribed in your book of life and peace.

"Memorial Prayer (for those lost through human strife)" By Rabbi Alexander Goode, was included by Rabbi Morrison David Bial in his collection of supplemental prayers and texts for personal prayer and synagogue services: <em>An Offering of Prayer</em> (Temple Sinai of Summit, New Jersey, 1962). As Rabbi Bial notes, Rabbi Goode was one of the chaplains who died in the sinking of the SS Dorchester. The sinking of the Dorchester and the deaths of Rabbi Goode and the three other chaplains on board are remembered on February 3rd, Four Chaplain's Day. I have lightly modified the original text of this prayer, replacing Thee and Thy with 'you' and 'your' respectively. --Aharon Varady
