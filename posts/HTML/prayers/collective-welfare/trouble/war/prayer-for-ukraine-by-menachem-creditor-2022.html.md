God of Peace,
We call to You, 
hearts pounding, 
as we pray for the people of Ukraine who are suffering under tyrant’s attack. 
Hear their prayers and ours. 
Support our commitment to stand with them in their time of great need. 
Please.

Dear God, 
how can we say Never Again when bombs fall on Babi Yar, 
when millions must run for their lives 
or take shelter in synagogues and subway stations? 
Haven’t we learned? 
You Who Remembers all, do not forsake us 
as we relearn these painful lessons.

In every generation there arise those who, 
in selfish pursuit of power, 
privilege might over moral right, 
precipitate needless earthquakes 
despite the tsunamis of human pain that will follow. 
Holy One, 
spoil the oppressors’ evil plans, 
diminish their power.

God, 
We have also witnessed great heroism during these dark days, 
human beings pushing back against tanks with their bare hands, 
the brave Jewish President of Ukraine, 
Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his family, 
millions of Ukrainians fighting to protect their homes. 
This is Your Image, 
strong and courageous, 
fierce and present. 
This is Your Outstretched Arm. 
We ask that You remind us to offer our own.

As one of Ukraine’s greatest teachers, Rebbe Naḥman, is said to have taught: 
“The Exodus from Egypt occurs in every human being, 
in every era, in every year, and in every day.”[foot]Source unavailable. A similar teaching is found at the <a href="https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7926/jewish/Chapter-47.htm">beginning of chapter 47</a> of the <em>Tanya</em> by Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi.[/foot] 
Holy One, may this teaching be fulfilled speedily and in our days.
