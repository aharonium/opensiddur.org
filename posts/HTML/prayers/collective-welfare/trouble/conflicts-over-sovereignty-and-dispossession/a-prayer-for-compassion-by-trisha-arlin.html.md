We pray for those of us
 Who are so angry
 That we have lost compassion for the suffering
 Of anyone who is not a member of our group.
 And we pray for those of us
 Who cannot see the suffering
 Behind the loss of that compassion.

We pray for the strength
 To resist the urge to inhumanity
 That we feel in times of fear and mourning.
 We pray for the courage
 To resist the calls to inhumanity
 That others may make upon us in times of crisis.

Barukh Atah Adonai

 Blessed One-ness, Blessed Connection,
 Kadosh Barukh Hu:
 May we find relief from our hurts and fears
 And may we not, in our pain,
 Lose our empathy
 For the hurts and fears of others.
 We pray for all who are in pain
 And all who cause pain.
 <em>Amen</em>
