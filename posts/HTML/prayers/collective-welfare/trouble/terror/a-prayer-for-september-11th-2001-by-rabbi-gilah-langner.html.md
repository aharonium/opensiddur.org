our Parent in heaven,
<em>v’Ruaḥ kol basar</em>, 
the Spirit of all that lives, 
We turn toward You 
as we recall today 
with sorrow and honor 
those who lost their lives (<em>n</em>) years ago, 
and those who gave their lives – 
as passengers, firemen, and rescuers – 
so that others might live.  
Grant their souls continuing rest 
in the shelter of eternity.
