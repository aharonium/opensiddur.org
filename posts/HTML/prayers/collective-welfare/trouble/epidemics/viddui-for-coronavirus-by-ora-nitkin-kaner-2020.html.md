The Viddui serves as a final prayer of atonement for a dying person, and a final at-one-ment; the traditional liturgy places the soul of the dying in God’s hands. According to Jewish law, Viddui is said when death seems imminent, and may be spoken by the dying person, their family members, or a rabbi. 

Below is a Viddui written for Jews who are losing a beloved to a plague, and who may not be able to be physically present or close to their loved one.
