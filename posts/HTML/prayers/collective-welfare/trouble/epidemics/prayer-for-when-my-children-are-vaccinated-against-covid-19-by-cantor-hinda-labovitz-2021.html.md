May I, with You, protect my children from all harm. 
And, when I can't, may they rely on those around them. 
Shelter them in Your wings, and sustain them, 
invigorate them, 
keep them safe in body and spirit. 
May we merit to raise these children to adulthood, 
instilling in them a love of community, 
care for their world, 
and engagement with what is right.

This prayer for a parent (or primary caregiver) on the vaccination of their children by Cantor Hinda Labovitz was first shared via their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cantor.labovitz/posts/4582015131821649">Facebook page</a> on 5 November 2021, with the following introduction:

<blockquote>I know there are several blessings/prayers floating around. Sharing mine in case it resonates, and to encourage others to compose and share your own if you are so moved. Remember, prayer can be as simple as an extemporaneous expression of our experience. I'm taking this with me when D & J (age 5.5) get vaccinated this Sunday (!), and I'm looking forward to asking them to share with me what that experience means to them, too.</blockquote>
