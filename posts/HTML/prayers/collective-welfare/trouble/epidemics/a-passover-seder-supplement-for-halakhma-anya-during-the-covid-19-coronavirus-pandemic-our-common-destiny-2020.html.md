Because tonight we cannot join together with our extended family, friends and community in celebration. This night is different because, as we tell the story of our people from slavery to freedom from Egypt to the Promised Land, we must also tell about our own time, about our own plagues and immediate needs.

The mystics taught us that Egypt was not only a historical place of enslavement, but as the Hebrew word for Egypt, Mitsrayim, suggests it is any state of narrowness, loneliness and fear a person experiences — a feeling many of us, and those we love, know too well during this COVID-19 pandemic. The Passover story is also about our individual and collective efforts to leave whatever narrow place we are in.

This night is different because we are not only remembering and reliving our shared history, but we are deeply mindful of our current crisis, and the urgency of learning about and speaking out about the impact of this plague — and many other plagues — happening around the globe to Jews and all people.

But each of us, and every Jew around the world, though we are more physically separated than ever, is strengthened because of our sense of Peoplehood. Despite all the ways in which we are separated, by distance; by the differences between our various movements, and our personal, national and religious identities; today -- more than ever -- we sense our connectedness and our mutual responsibility. Especially now, this Passover, we can commit ourselves to our shared future, to our common destiny.

Our Common Destiny is a new global initiative that gathers us together as one people, and we offer this addition, a new ‘<em>kavvanah</em>’ or additional reading for your Seder Table. You can also say it whenever and wherever you eat matsah this Passover. This insert was created by Our Common Destiny, which aims to strengthen global Jewry by linking Jewish communities worldwide to a shared set of values, shaped by the input of our diverse global community. <a href="http://surveys.ourcommondestiny.org/s3/">You can add your voice here</a>.

In the profound opening of the Haggadah, there is a Jewish message with universal reach: we need each other, and we need to be sure that, as it says in the Haggadah, “let all who are hungry enter and eat; and all who are in need come and celebrate.” May all of humanity hear the response of the Jewish people: We will uphold our collective responsibility for each other and for the world.

This is the meaning of the Passover Matsah this year. While we are a generation who has been divided, we must now come together to imagine a new future, a common destiny based on shared values and respond to the needs of all.
