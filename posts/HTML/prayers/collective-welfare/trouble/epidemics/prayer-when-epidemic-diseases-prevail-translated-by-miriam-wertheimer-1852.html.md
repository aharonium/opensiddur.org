Lord of life! 
the everlasting pillars of Thy throne are justice and clemency, 
those holy attributes which govern the earth 
and direct the destinies of mortals. 
When the generations of man become corrupt 
and turn aside from Thy righteous ways, 
Thou sendest forth the destroying angel, 
as messenger of Thy wrath 
to wield the dreadful scourge of punishment. 
But even then, Father! 
Thou sendest Thy minister of peace, 
to convey the treasures of Thy grace 
and pardon to all who turn towards Thee.

So, God of compassion! 
let Thy heavenly attribute of mercy 
temper ever the severity of Thy justice; 
for who could stand, Lord! 
if Thou shouldst visit us according to our works, 
without indulgence or forgiveness.

But especially, Lord! 
at this, the time of fear and dread,

Be unto us, God of goodness! 
a Preserver and Redeemer, 
for disease is round about us and destruction impends. 
Shield us with Thy mercy, 
from the arrow of death which flieth by day; 
from the pestilence which stalketh in darkness; 
from the destruction which wasteth at noontide. 
Restrain Thy messenger of wrath, 
which walks through earth, 
mowing down alike the mature plants 
and the tender shoots; 
and as Thou, in former times, 
didst hearken to the prayer of Thy priest, and Thine anointed, 
and didst recal the angel of destruction, 
so, Lord! now hearken to our supplications, 
and once more saying — 
"it is enough, stay now thy hand;" <span class="citation">(II Samuel 24:16)</span>
remove from us the devouring pestilence.

Have compassion on us, God of mercy! 
and blot out the record of our transgressions. 
Let Thy minister of grace keep watch at our gates, 
that the devouring scourge pass not over the threshold of our habitation. 
Avert, in Thy compassion, 
from me, 
my husband, 
and my children, 
from all my friends and my acquaintances, 
the destructive influence which is abroad; 
and turn the wailing 
which is heard in every street and public place, 
into the cry of joy and consolation.

Lord! 
I wring my hands in fervent devotion 
before the throne of Thy Majesty, 
for my heart bleeds when I reflect on the suffering and woe, 
which threaten so many of my fellow-creatures. 
Draw back from us, then, Thy castigating hand 
and ascend Thy throne of mercy. 
Extend to us Thy Heavenly support, 
that we may walk henceforth, 
in the cheerful light of Thy vivifying countenance. 
<em>Amen</em>.

"Prayer when epidemic diseases prevail" was written by an unknown author in German and translated into English by Miriam Wertheimer. We have transcribed her translation as it was published in <em><a href="/?p=41448">Devotional Exercises for the Use of Jewish Women on Public and Domestic Occasions</a></em> (1852), pp. 70-71. The sad inspiration for this prayer was likely the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1846–1860_cholera_pandemic">1846-1860 Cholera Pandemic</a>.

I have not been able to locate a copy of the original work from which this translation was derived. If you know of its existence, even the name of its title, please leave a comment or <a href="/contact/">contact us</a>. --Aharon Varady
