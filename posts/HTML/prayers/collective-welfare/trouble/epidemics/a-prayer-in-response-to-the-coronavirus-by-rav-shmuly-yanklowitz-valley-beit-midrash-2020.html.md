Master of the Universe,
â€‹&nbsp;
Our Creator and Liberator of diseases
We are afraid and unprepared.
We beseech you for guidance and support.
Grant victims the strength to persevere.
Grant caregivers the courage to heal.
Grant researchers and experts the insights to detect, to treat, and to vaccinate.
Grant medical providers the abilities to heal all who suffer.
Grant officials the courage to speak the truth and not to violate public trust.

May You bless us with the strength to remain calm. 
Allow us to not use fear and suspicion 
as paths to xenophobia, selfishness, or isolation. 
May You grant us empathy for those affected. 
May you refine our empathy for those who suffer all over the world. 
May we look past cultural differences and disagreements 
to strengthen global collaboration to preserve life.
