Almighty God, Master of the Universe, 
the Members of this august body, the U.S. Senate, 
convene here today to fulfill one of the Seven Commandments 
which You issued to Noah and his family after the Great Flood:
the commandment that all society be governed by just laws.   
&nbsp;
As stated in the book of Genesis and its sacred commentaries,[foot]Sanhedrin 56a; cf. Tosefta Avodah Zarah 9:4 and Genesis Rabbah 34:8. Six items were commanded to Adam: concerning idolatry, blasphemy, bloodshed, illicit sexuality, theft, and laws…God added to Noah, the law of not eating from the flesh of a live animal.” (Mishneh Torah, Kings and Wars 9:1). The impetus behind sharing the sheva mitsvot in the context of ḤaBaD Lubavitch originates with the following teaching of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson: "We must do everything possible to ensure that the seven Noahide laws are observed. If this can be accomplished through force or through other kinder and more peaceful means through explaining to non-Jews that they should accept God’s wishes [we should do so]…Anyone who is able to influence a non-Jew in any way to keep the seven commandments is obligated to do so, since that is what God commanded Moses our teacher," (“Sheva Mitzvot Shel Benai Noach,” Hapardes 59:9 7-11, 5745).[/foot]&nbsp;  
You issued at that time the following seven laws: 
<ol>
<li>to worship You and You alone;</li> 
<li>never to blaspheme Your Holy Name;</li>  
<li>not to commit murder;</li>  
<li>not to commit adultery, incest, or any sexual misdeeds;</li>  
<li>not to steal, lie, or cheat;</li>  
<li>not to be cruel to any living creature;</li>  
<li>and that every society be governed by just laws 
based on the recognition and acknowledgement of You, O God, 
as the sovereign Ruler of all humankind and all nations.</li> 
</ol>

to bless the Senate and our entire Nation 
in the merit of two spiritual giants 
of our time and of our country, 
Rabbi <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Yitzchak_Schneersohn">Yosef Yitzchak Schneerson</a> of saintly blessed memory--

Tomorrow, the 10th day of the Hebrew month of Shəvat,

It is a day of reflection and action

Their holy mission continues 
through our acts of goodness and kindness, 
hastening the harmonious era 
of the messianic redemption. 
<em>Amen</em>.
