Sponsor: Rep. Thomas Peter Lantos (D-CA)
Date of Prayer: 06/17/2003

<blockquote>
<h3>One Minute Speech Given in Recognition of the Guest Chaplain:</h3>

Mr. LANTOS. Madam Speaker, I am pleased to welcome to the Chamber Rabbi David Halpern, who offered our opening prayer. I thank him for his thoughtful invocation.

Madam Speaker, Rabbi Halpern's accomplishments in his community of Flatbush, Brooklyn, have touched many lives across the Nation, and his work merits national recognition.

He leads the Flatbush Park Jewish Center. He is the Principal of the religious school there, which he helped found in 1952. He sought to create a place where religiously observant and religiously curious alike can feel comfortable; to advance the goal of Jewish learning; and to support Jewish causes around our country and around the globe. He also served as a Chaplain in the 71st Infantry of the 42nd Division of the National Guard for 10 years, and he sits on the New York board of Rabbis.

Madam Speaker, the esteem in which the Flatbush Park Jewish Center is held indicates that Rabbi Halpern's efforts have been an unqualified success. In recognition of his sense of compassion and leadership, he was chosen to speak on behalf of the community of Flatbush in the wake of the 9/11 tragedy.

Madam Speaker, I am delighted that he was able to share some of his wisdom and grace with us today. We admire his commitment to his faith and to his community.

Our Father, Sovereign of the world, 
we stand in the House 
of freely elected representatives 
of all the American people. 
These men and women,

by which our free society lives 
and shall live. 
They wear this mantel of leadership

The threat to human security 
wears many faces: 
Tyranny, 
terror, 
religious oppression, 
racial tension, 
disease, 
hunger

We seek the solution to these problems. 
We search diligently for the road to peace, 
for the path to harmonious living, 
for the means to achieve human dignity 
for us all created in Thine image.

May we always remember 
that to safeguard our own freedom, 
we must speak out against oppression,
and, where warranted, even take up arms against it. 
To enjoy the blessings of our own wealth, 
we must also provide for the underprivileged and the needy. 
To be truly strong requires more than strength of arms, 
it requires strength of spirit.

Almost six decades have passed
since the age of the Nazi death camps, 
the places where 6 million Jewish men, women and children 
had their lives cruelly and brutally ended, 
their only sin that they were born Jewish. 
The world has watched helplessly 
as in the last decade 
hundreds of thousands 
of different nationalities 
and ethnic groups 
have been slaughtered. 
We pray 
that the destruction of man 
by his fellow 
because of religious beliefs 
or racial origins 
will be known no more; 
that people of different religious paths 
may learn to live side–by–side 
in peace 
and in harmony.
