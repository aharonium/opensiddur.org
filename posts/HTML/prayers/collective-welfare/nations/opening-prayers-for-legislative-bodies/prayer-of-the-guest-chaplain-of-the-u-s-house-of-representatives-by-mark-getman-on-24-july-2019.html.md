<blockquote>
<h3>One Minute Speech Given in Recognition of the Guest Chaplain:</h3>

Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome Rabbi Mark Getman of Temple Emanu-El of Canarsie, Brooklyn, and thank him for leading us in prayer this morning on the House floor.

I was proud to invite Rabbi Getman to give the opening prayer today, and I am even more proud to call him a constituent of New York's Fourth Congressional District.

Rabbi Getman is a military veteran, a cancer survivor, a community leader, and a man of deep faith. He embodies the strength, leadership, and patriotism that we look for in every American.

I can't express how grateful I am to Rabbi Getman for making the trip down to Washington today to represent our community and to deliver a message of harmony and compassion. I believe that is a message that our country needs to hear, perhaps now more than ever.

Rabbi Getman graciously reminded us today that we are a country united under God, in our pursuit of prosperity and peace for all people, and he reminded us that this shared purpose is more powerful, more important than any political division we may have, and I couldn't agree more.

As a member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I am beyond appreciative that Rabbi Getman paid such a touching tribute to the brave men and women who wear our uniform today and to those who paid the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our great Nation. As a veteran himself, I know that Rabbi Getman understands that sacrifice better than most.

I want to thank Rabbi Getman once more for his service to our community and to our country and, above all, for taking the time to be here with us today and delivering a much-needed message of unity.
