Source of Wisdom, 
Well of Justice, 
Fountain of Goodness and of Peace, 
we praise You for pouring Your spirit upon humanity 
as we struggle feebly to fashion our society 
into the kind of world You have envisioned. 
We cherish Your guidance 
as we strive to bring peace, 
harmony, 
and equity to this world 
in which we are Your partners.

As these elected officials begin another day 
of deliberation in the U.S. Senate, 
we pray that Your presence may dwell among them. 
Enable them to discern and to acquire 
but a minute portion of Your wisdom and compassion, 
Your knowledge of what is just and right, 
as they carry out the awesome task 
of governing our great Nation. 
Grant them insight and endurance 
as they consider the weighty issues 
facing our country. 
Endow them with deep concern 
for one another, 
for their constituents, 
for the people of this Nation 
and indeed of the entire world. 
Give them courage 
to take difficult stands 
and to ask the hard questions which must be asked 
in order to bring wholeness to our broken world.

Eternal Power of the Universe, 
Author of Freedom, 
to You we offer thanks and praise.
