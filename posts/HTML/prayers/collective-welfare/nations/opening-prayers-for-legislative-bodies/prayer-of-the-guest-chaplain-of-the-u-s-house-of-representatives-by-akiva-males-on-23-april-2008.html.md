<blockquote>
<h3>One Minute Speech Given in Recognition of the Guest Chaplain:</h3>

Mr. HOLDEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and thank Rabbi Akiva Males for providing today's prayer and blessing for both the House and for our country.

Rabbi Males is a native of Cleveland, Ohio, which he left to pursue his ordainment by attending rabbinical schools in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Jerusalem, Israel; and Queens, New York. He was eventually ordained as a rabbi by the Rabbinical Seminary of America in Queens, New York.

Rabbi Males is a member of the Rabbinical Council of America. He and his wife Lynn reside in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, located in my congressional district. He is now assisting Rabbi Dr. Chaim Schertz at Kesher Israel Congregation, a synagogue comprised of close to 200 members that has been an enhancing force in Harrisburg for over 100 years.

Rabbi Males is a pillar of faith, service, and commitment in the Harrisburg community, and I welcome him and his family to our Nation's Capital.
