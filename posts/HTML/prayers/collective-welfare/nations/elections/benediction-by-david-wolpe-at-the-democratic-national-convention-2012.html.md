Ribono shel Olam, dear God,
we are grateful that our nation is founded 
on the highest principles 
of freedom 
and resourcefulness 
and creativity 
and ever renewed strength. 
And we understand that those worthy ideals 
stand alongside the commitment 
to compassion, to goodness --
[to] our sacred covenant to care 
for those who are bereaved and bereft, 
who are frightened, 
who are hungry, 
who are bewildered and lost, 
who seek shelter from the cold. 
As your prophet Isaiah taught us, 
<em>shiftu yatom rivu almanah</em> -- 
defend the orphan and fight on behalf of the widow.[foot]Isaiah 1:17.[/foot]

We know that our lamp is lifted 
not only to illuminate our way 
but to serve as a beacon 
to others that hear this land is a place 
where the dreams of a weary world 
flourish and endure.

Ours is a holy charge, 
a single moment, 
a touch, 
a glance, 
a word can change a life. 
Our children look to us with aspirational eyes 
with the hope that their world will be kinder, 
sweeter, 
smarter than the world we have known. 
Each of these changes touches all of us, 
for you have taught us 
that we must count on one another, 
that our country is strong through community 
and that the children of Israel, 
on the way to that sanctified and cherished land 
and ultimately to that golden and capital city of Jerusalem, 
that those children of Israel did not walk through the wilderness alone.

Raḥmanah, merciful god, 
may we be guided by your wisdom 
and so become more understanding 
and tolerant of others. 
May our souls be enlarged by empathy 
and uplifted by leaders 
and thinkers 
and teachers 
who believe in strength of soul 
and wild, wonderful visions, 
so [that] together 
with Right and Left worshiping the same god, 
our nation, this strong, blessed nation, 
filled with spirit 
and called to noble cause 
will become more passionate, 
more purposeful, 
more burnished and bright 
through the warmth of your embrace,
and the extraordinary power, dear God, of your love. 
<em>Amen</em>.
