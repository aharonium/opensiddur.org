God of Compassion, 
show us the way to improve the lives of our fellow Americans. 
Remind us that our greatest achievements begin by helping each of us to build a good life, 
to have the opportunity to work and to contribute, 
to care for ourselves and our families, 
to raise up our children with proper health care and a good education, 
and to age with wisdom and dignity.

God of Healing, 
comfort us in the difficult days that have marked this turbulent summer 
in our country and around the world. 
Guide our hands to reach out towards one another 
certain in the truth that what unites us is greater than anything that divides us. 
Let us keep the faith that the healing of our wounds will make us stronger than ever.

God Who is Great, Mighty, and Awesome, 
in a season so filled with chatter 
of who is great and what is great and what shall be great, 
let us remember Scripture's clear, simple explanation of greatness: 
God is the great, the mighty and the awesome 
for God defends the cause of the widow and the orphan, 
and loves the stranger residing among you. 
This is God's greatness 
and this is the greatness the American people must strive to imitate.

God of History, 
help us to understand that this is the most important election of our lives. 
Help us to recognize that the gift -- 
the miracle of U.S. Democracy, 
our freedom, 
our community 
and everything we hold dear -- 
rests in the hands of her people at this moment. 
We are a beautiful country of people as diverse as your creation. 
We are each unique, each a part of a group or groups we identify with proudly, 
and each a person of infinite value created in your divine image.

to walk in your ways 
which are paths of pleasantness 
and peace, 
and let us say <em>Amen</em>.
