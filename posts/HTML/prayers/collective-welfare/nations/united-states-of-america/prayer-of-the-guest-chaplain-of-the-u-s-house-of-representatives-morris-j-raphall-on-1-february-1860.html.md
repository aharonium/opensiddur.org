Almighty and most merciful God, 
we approach Thy presence this day 
to thank Thee for Thy past mercies, 
and humbly to beseech Thee 
to continue and extend the same to Thy servants, 
the Representatives of these United States in Congress assembled.

Lord, 
great and manifold have been Thy bounties 
to this highly-favored land. 
Heartfelt and sincere are our thanks. 
While the vast despotisms of Asia 
are crumbling into dust, 
and the effete monarchies of the Old World 
can only sustain themselves by yielding to the pressure 
of the spirit of the age, 
it has been Thy gracious will 
that in this Western hemisphere 
there should be established a Commonwealth 
after the model of that which Thou, Thyself, 
didst bestow on the tribes of Israel, 
in their best and purest days.

The Constitution and the institutions of this Republic 
prove to the world that men, 
created in Thy image and obedient to Thy behests, 
are not only capable, fully capable, of self-government, 
but that they know best how to combine 
civil liberty with ready obedience to the laws, 
religious liberty with warm zeal for religion, 
absolute general equality with sincere respect for individual rights.

In acquiring and carrying out these most wise institutions, 
Thy protection, Lord, has been signally manifest. 
It was Thy right hand 
that defended the founders of this Commonwealth, 
during the long and perilous struggle 
of right against might. 
It was Thy wisdom 
that inspired them 
when they established this Congress, 
to be what Thy tabernacle, 
with the <em>urim</em> and <em>thummin</em> — 
right and equity — 
were intended to have been for the tribes of Israel — 
the heart of the entire nation, 
where the wants, 
the feelings, 
and wishes of all 
might become known, 
to be respected by all, 
so that union might create strength, 
and concord keep pace with prosperity.

Lord, 
the ordinary life-time of a man has barely elapsed 
since this Constitution came into force, 
and under its auspices our country, 
from being feeble and poor 
has become wealthy and powerful, 
ready to take rank with the mightiest, 
and Thou, O Lord, wilt realize unto it 
Thy gracious promise unto Thy chosen people: 
<em>Ve-hotircha adonai letobah</em> — 
the Lord will distinguish thee for that which is good. <span class="citation">(Deuteronomy 28:11 part)</span>

Supreme Ruler of the universe, 
many days and many weeks have gone by 
since thy servants, our Representatives, 
first met in this Congress, 
but not yet have they been able to organize their House. 
Thou who makest peace in Thy high Heavens, 
direct their minds this day 
that with one consent they may agree 
to choose the man who, 
without fear and without favor, 
is to preside over this assembly. 
To this intent, Father most gracious, 
do Thou endow them with Thy spirit; 
the spirit of wisdom and of understanding; 
the spirit of counsel and of amity; 
the spirit of knowledge and of fear of the Lord.

Grant, Father, 
that amidst the din of conflicting interests and opinions, 
Thy grace may direct them 
so that each one of them and all of them 
may hold the even tenor of their way — 
the way of moderation and of equity; 
that they may speak and act and legislate 
for Thy glory and the happiness of our country; 
so that, 
from the North and from the South, 
from the East and from the West, 
one feeling of satisfaction may attend their labors; 
while the whole people of the land 
joyfully repeat the words of Thy Psalmist: 
"How good and how pleasant it is 
when brethren dwell together in unity." <span class="citation">(Psalms 133:1)</span>

This is the text of the Rabbi Morris Jacob Raphall's prayer offered before the U.S. House of Representatives as recorded in the <em>Congressional Globe</em>, (part 1, 36th Congress, 1st Session, 1859-1860) pp. 648-649, and reprinted (with corrections to the included romanized Hebrew) in <em><a href="https://www.nli.org.il/en/newspapers/?a=is&oid=occ18600209-01&type=staticpdf&e=-------en-20--1--img-txIN%7ctxTI--------------1">The Occident and American Jewish Advocate</a></em>, vol. 18, no. 46, 9 Feb 1860, pp. 275-276. (Many thanks to the National Library of Israel's <a href="https://www.nli.org.il/en/discover/newspapers/jpress">Historical Jewish Press</a> resource for making page images of this resource accessible.) Only two weeks prior to offering this prayer, Raphall had delivered a controversial sermon, "<a href="http://jewish-history.com/civilwar/raphall.html">The Bible View of Slavery</a>," which provided a defense of slavery. His argument was <a href="http://jewish-history.com/civilwar/einhorn.html">passionately refuted</a> by Rabbi David Einhorn and others.
