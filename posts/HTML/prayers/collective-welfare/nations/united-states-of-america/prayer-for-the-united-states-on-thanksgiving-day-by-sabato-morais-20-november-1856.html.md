Omnipotent Being! 
Thy glory filleth the universe. 
When we lift up our eyes above, 
and behold the firmament studded with numberless worlds, 
each sustained in its sphere by an inexplicable force, 
we marvel at thy look around us, 
and ponder on the formation of countless beings, 
from the huge elephant to the minutest animalcula, 
all symmetrically framed, 
all gifted with the power of vitality, 
we wonder at thy wisdom.

When we survey the ground 
and observe how a few scattered grains, 
yield abundance of fruit for man and cattle, 
we are astounded at thy Providence; 
but when we regard ourselves 
and think of the station we hold in the creation, 
of the faculties which enable us 
to maintain ourselves elevated 
above all animate creatures, 
of the sublime knowledge thou hast taught us 
to illumine our reason, and guide it upwards, 
then, sentiments of love, 
of reverence and gratitude 
fill our shirt, for, “what is man 
that thou hast taken cognizance of him, 
and made him little lower than angels, 
and crowned him with honor and excellency.” <span class="citation">(Psalms 8:5-6)</span>
Can his noblest act add ought to thy greatness, 
or his enormities tarnish thy glory? 
No, for thou art immutable and eternal, 
but, Thou dost assign for him a place so lofty, 
that he might strive after truth, 
and by imitating thy attributes, 
identify himself with that Unity 
which is the soul of the universe. 
Oh! let therefore thy intelligent creatures 
sing thy praise with unison of hearts.

But above all, our thanks are due to thee, 
for having granted us to be born under that law, 
which instructs us in our duties towards ourselves 
and our fellow-beings. 
May the principles of charity and love 
embodied in that law, 
be ever developed in the political code 
of this generous country. 
May we, its citizens, never forswear our trust, 
but maintain it in its entirety, 
despite the impediments 
that may obstruct our course.

Grant O God! 
that a confederacy of all the inhabitants of the world,

for, then there shall be but one flock, 
and Thou shall be their Shepherd. 
Grant that all the nations of the earth, 
may like us, acknowledge thy bounty, 
and sing to thy holy name, for, 
“Thou art a good God, 
and praise becometh thee.” <span class="citation">(Psalms 33:1)</span>

This Thanksgiving Day prayer by Rabbi Sabato Morais was offered at the conclusion of a "The Watchfulness of Providence over Nations. A Thanksgiving Address delivered by the Rev. S. Morais, Minister of the Portuguese Synagogue, of Philadelphia, on the 20th November, 1856." and recorded in <em>The Asmonean</em> (on 28 November 1856. It was preserved by Rabbi Morais in <a href="http://sceti.library.upenn.edu/pages/index.cfm?so_id=1661&pageposition=24&level=1">his ledger</a> (page 8, clipping 007), an archive of newsclippings recording material he contributed to the press, among other announcements. A note next to the clipping reads, "His lecture aimed to oppose knownothingism (???) antagonism indirectly shown." (Many thanks to the Library of the University of Pennsylvania for helping to make this resource accessible.)
