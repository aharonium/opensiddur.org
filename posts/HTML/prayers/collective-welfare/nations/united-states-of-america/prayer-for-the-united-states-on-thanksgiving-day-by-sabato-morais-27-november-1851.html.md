Lord God! 
from whom proceeds all which is right, good, aud holy, 
may thy name be glorified on earth amidst the faithful, 
as it is blessed above by the immortals. 
May thy law of truth soon spread among thy creatures, 
that all born may worship thee, 
the only God, immutable, and eternal. 
May thy servants who have executed thy blessed will, 
enjoy enlargment and peace, 
till the voice of the Redeemer 
shall be beard on Mount Zion.

unfold, O God! 
the pavilion of thy peace; 
may their religious conduct 
and future progress in the path of true wisdom 
shine brilliantly over America, 
and on Israel thy beloved children. 
<em>Amen</em>.
