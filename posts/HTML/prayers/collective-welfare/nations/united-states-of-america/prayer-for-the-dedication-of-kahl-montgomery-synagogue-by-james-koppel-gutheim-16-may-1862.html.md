Jewish prayers for the well-being of the sovereign, government, and country are common in every place Jewish congregations gather. Thus, it is no great surprise to find one offered by a rabbi for the State of Alabama and the Confederate States of America at a dedication ceremony of a new synagogue building in 1862. But given that unrepentant revanchist and racist white supremacists continue to celebrate the Confederacy in our own day, often under the guise of "honoring southern pride," we share the text of this prayer only for its historical import and as a cautious lesson. Patriotism born of genuine appreciation for freedom, liberty, and sanctuary granted to some can blind those privileged to the lives and labor stolen from others. Recognizing such depravity where and when it occurs should ground us in every place we dwell. As Emma Lazarus later argued in "<a href="https://jwa.org/media/quote-from-epistle-to-hebrews">An Epistle to the Hebrews</a>" (1883): "Until we are all free, we are none of us free," or as Proverbs 4:14 teaches, "Enter not into the path of the wicked, and walk not in the way of evil men." —Aharon Varady

abashed, confounded and discomfited. 
Thou, O Lord, who makest peace in the highest heavens,

so that safety, confidence and happiness 
again smile upon the land,
