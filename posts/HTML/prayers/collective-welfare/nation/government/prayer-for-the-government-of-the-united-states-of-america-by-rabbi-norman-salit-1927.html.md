Our God and the God of our fathers, 
we beseech you this day 
to bless our adopted country, 
America. 
Grant unto it the precious gift of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americanism_(ideology)">Americanism</a>. 
Prevent it from losing its own soul. 
Cause it not to wander in the paths of other peoples.
Make it ever loyal to those proud principles 
of liberty 
of thought, 
of conscience, 
and of action 
with which it so bravely began its career as a nation.

<div class="english">
In a world seeking desperately for deliverance 
from the nightmare of passion and prejudice, 
of oppression and bureaucracy, 
make this country to be the leader of liberal thought 
and of broad human sympathies. 
Purge our land from every hate of soul, 
from every lust of plutocracy, 
from every intolerance of bigotry 
and narrowness of vision. 
Make our leaders conscious of the fact 
that to be mindful of <em>any</em> group only, 
instead of <em>all</em> our inhabitants, 
is to be guilty of nothing less than treason 
to the genius and to the people of our country.

Restore to this country, O Lord, 
its dearest possession, namely: 
its pure reliance,—
not upon might or upon power,—
not upon the might of the sword or the power of gold,— 
but upon Thine own spirit—
and cause all Thy people Israel within this country’s borders 
to remember and to understand 
that we need not be less the Jew in order to be more the American, 
but rather that we can <em>never</em> be <em>more</em> American 
than when are <em>most</em> the Jew.
&nbsp;
<em>Amen</em>.
