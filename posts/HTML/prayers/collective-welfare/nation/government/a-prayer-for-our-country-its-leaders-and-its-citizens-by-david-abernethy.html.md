Bless those chosen to lead this country 
with the wisdom and courage to act justly 
and to serve the needs of all, not just the few. 
&nbsp; 
Teach them 
that the true aim of public service 
is not personal profit 
or the gratification of ego 
but pursuit of the public good. 
&nbsp; 
Grant them the patience and understanding 
to treat with dignity and respect 
those who criticize or disagree with them.  
&nbsp;
Remind them 
that every citizen is entitled to a voice, 
in the voting booth and in the public square.  
&nbsp;
Help them understand 
that the true promise of our country 
will not be realized 
until full justice and dignity 
are afforded to all who dwell in this land, 
no matter the color of their skin, 
where they were born, 
whom they love, 
or how they serve You.

Bless us

Inspire us 
to stand up for what we believe to be right 
and oppose what we believe to be wrong, 
while treating with courtesy and respect those who, 
in good faith and from love of country, 
hold views different than ours.

Help us understand

to protest unjust laws and actions,

the valid laws properly enacted

selfish pursuits with devotion to the needs of all;

This prayer -- for the United States, its leaders and government and its citizens -- was my personal response to things that were deeply concerning to me in the months leading up to our most recent election.  A rising level of divisiveness in our public discourse.  A common belief that we need not be respectful of those with whom we disagree.  And a growing acceptance of the view that every individual is entitled to choose which of our society’s rules to follow, and which not – that we need only concern ourselves with our own rights and opinions, not our responsibilities to one another.  Over the past few months I have read many beautiful and deeply moving versions of prayers for our country and its government, all highlighting different concerns and challenges, but all reflecting a deeply rooted tradition of concern for the welfare of the nations and communities in which we live.  This one is simply one person’s way of expressing that concern. Shared within a synagogue community but not published elsewhere. --David Abernethy
