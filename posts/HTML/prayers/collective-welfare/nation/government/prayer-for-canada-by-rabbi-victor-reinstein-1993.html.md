May we honour with humility those who first dwelled on this land,[foot]The text read in the Congregation Emanu-El in Victoria, British Columbia, is "May we honour with humility the Lekwungen People..."[/foot]&nbsp;

Compassionate One, 
teach us Your way of compassion.

May it never again be that “none is too many” 
for any people seeking refuge in our land of plenty.

May our country be an influence for good within the family of nations, 
a voice of conscience, 
and a leader in seeking peace and pursuing it.  
And let us say: Amen.

This prayer for Canada was written by Rabbi Victor Reinstein in the early 1990s during his tenure as rabbi of Congregation Emanu-El in Victoria, British Columbia (from 1982-1998). The prayer is in use by several other congregations in Canada. In Victoria, the prayer has been slightly edited to include names of local indigenous peoples.
