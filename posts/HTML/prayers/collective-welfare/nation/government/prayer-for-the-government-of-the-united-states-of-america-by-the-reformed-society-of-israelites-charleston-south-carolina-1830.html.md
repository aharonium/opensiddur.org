Almighty God! sole ruler and governor of the whole universe! 
Thou who hast created countless systems for thy glory! 
Thou, who fillest all space with thy wisdom, truth, order and benevolence, 
in thy boundless mercy, bless, preserve and enlighten
the President of these United States, together with his counsellors, 
and all the officers of the General and State Governments, 
executive, legislative and judicial. 
O, may a portion of thy divine wisdom 
fill the halls of their assemblies, 
and direct their hearts and understandings 
for the honour of thy holy name, 
and the prosperity of our beloved country. 
May the spirit of peace be ever in their counsels, 
and integrity be their leading principle.

We have reason to bless and extol thy goodness, O Lord!

and equality of rights 
the only fountain of power.

defend them on every side

Gary Zola writes that the prayer was written by David Carvalho for the Society as indicated in Abraham Mo√Øse's annotated copy of the 1830 prayerbook.[foot]Find, "The First Reform Prayerbook in America" (p. 115 ft. 29) in <em>Platforms and prayer books: theological and liturgical perspectives on Reform Judaism</em> (2002)[/foot] Zola calls this prayer "historically significant" as it is the first time that the traditional prayer for the government was replaced by a different prayer in an American siddur. --Aharon Varady
