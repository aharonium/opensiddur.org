This is "A Prayer for the Government" by Rabbi Dr. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Ginzberg">Louis Ginzberg</a>, as found in <em>Festival Prayer Book</em>, edited by Jacob Kohn and Maurice H. Farbridge (1927), p.200, and in <em>The Respona of Professor Louis Ginzberg</em>, ed. D. Golinkin (1996). This is a new translation (2010) by Tim Daniel Bernard, closely following the the original Hebrew Prayer. 

In his article "<a class="pdf" href="https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Conservative_Payerbooks_(Eric_L._Friedland,_1976).pdf">Conservative Prayerbooks</a>" written for the <em>Jewish Spectator</em> in 1976, Dr. Eric Friedland had this to say about the <em>Festival Prayer Book</em> and Louis Ginzburg's Prayer for the Government:

<blockquote>The <em>Festival Prayerbook</em> (1927, under the auspices of the United Synagogue of America), the first publication to bear the stamp of the Conservative Movement, shared not a few of the characteristics of the liturgical productions of Britain's Orthodox United Synagogue, the <em>Authorized Daily Prayerbook</em> and various mahzorim, noted for their neat and orderly layout, textual accuracy, and judicious curtailment of piyyutim. The early disciples of Solomon Schechter, who himself had spent some time in Cambridge before he came and settled in New York to put the then-teetering Jewish Theological Seminary on its feet, were not impervious to the neo-classical trend of the nineteenth-century Anglo-Catholic Tractarians of the Church of England. While the elevated, formal "high-church" tone of the <em>Festival Prayerbook</em> has long since been supplanted, many of that prayerbook's meticulous standards have been retained. One innovation that has perdured is Professor Louis Ginzberg's Prayer for the Government. The entreaty is patriotic in the best sense of the term with scarce a trace of jingoism. Its longevity is warranted.</blockquote>

In his review, Dr. Friedland was speaking specifically of Ginzberg's original Hebrew liturgy. The prayer was republished with slightly altered Hebrew text in <em><a href="/?p=15128">Seder Tefilot Yisrael: Sabbath and Festival Prayer Book</a></em>, compiled by the Rabbinical Assembly & United Synagogue of America (1946) p.130, and in <em>Sim Shalom</em> (1985) p.414-415. The translation of the prayer as found in <em>Sim Shalom</em> was read into the <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CREC-1994-02-23/html/CREC-1994-02-23-pt1-PgS2.htm">Congressional Record</a> (vol. 140, no. 16, Wednesday 23 February 1994) by Rabbi Paul D. Kerbel of Congregation Nevey Shalom, Bowie, Maryland on 1994. (There is also a delightful recording of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, z"l, offering it at Congregation Beth El in Bethesda, Maryland, on October 3rd, 2013.) 

A new English translation of Louis Ginzberg's Prayer for the Government was the main impetus behind Rabbi Tim Bernard's contribution. As Rabbi Bernard explains:

<blockquote>This translation is more straightforward, less archaic, and much closer to original Hebrew than the traditional translation found in Conservative prayer books published between 1927 and 2005.</blockquote>
