Some lose faith and think that things will never change,
But we Americans – of every faith – religious faith or not –
Refuse to give up hope or abandon that most American of dreams:
That we can make a difference, and that the future can be better than the past.

A prayer offered by Rabbi Arnold Resnicoff at the Presidential signing ceremony for the repeal of the "Don't Ask Don't Tell" (DADT) law on December 22, 2010, in Washington, D.C. It was originally planned to be held at the White House, but interest in attending the ceremony was so large that the venue was changed to the Department of the Interior. For a personal reflection on this prayer, find <a href="https://www.thenewcivilrightsmovement.com/2014/04/on_the_eve_of_christmas_a_navy_rabbi_and_lesbian_army_captain_reunite_to_bear_witness_to_dadt_s_end/">this essay</a> by Tanya L. Domi.
