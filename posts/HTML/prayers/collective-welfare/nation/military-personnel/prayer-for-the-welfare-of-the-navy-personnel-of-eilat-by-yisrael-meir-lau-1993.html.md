Many Americans don't realize that the first modern Israeli "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%27ar_5-class_corvette">Sa'ar 5 corvette</a>" ships were built in the United States, at the Ingalls Shipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi, as a joint US-Israeli project.

On March 19, 1993, the first of the three that would be built there -- INS <em>Eilat</em> -- was commissioned. Speakers at the ceremony included Israeli Rear Admiral Ami Ayalon, the Commander in Chief of the Israeli Navy (what we would call the Chief of Naval Operations, here in the US), and the Honorable Ismar Rabinovich, the Israeli Ambassador to the US. His wife was the "sponsor" of the commissioning, breaking the traditional bottle of champagne against the hull.  

I had the honor of delivering the commissioning prayer -- but instead of writing my own, I was given a prayer written by the newly appointed Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of Israel, Israel Lau. The document that included the prayer was the very first document he signed in his new position. In addition to the Hebrew text, I offered an English prayer inspired by the words of Rabbi Lau. --Rabbi Arnold Resnicoff

<blockquote>
My brothers and friends:

To all who walk the deck of "Eilat," may your welfare be everlasting!

David, King of Israel, in his description of those who come to praise and thank the Creator of the universe, says: "They who go down to the sea in ships, who do business in great waters; they see the work of the Lord, and His wonders in the deep .... He maketh the storm to be calm, so that the waves thereof are still. Then are they glad because they are quiet, and He bringeth them unto their desired haven. Let them praise the Lord for His goodness and for His wonderful works for the children of men" <span class="citation">(Psalms 107:23-31)</span>.

You - the warriors of the Navy within the Israel Defense Force - who go through the seas and fierce waters to defend and protect the State of Israel and its inhabitants, fulfill a sacred duty to protect the holiness of the life of both the whole and the individual.

Our prayers are directed to you, the Navy personnel of "Eilat.” In peace shall you go and in peace shall you return. May your Journey be successful and may you bring peace unto Israel.
&nbsp;

Blessings from the depths of my heart,
Rabbi Arnold E. Resnicoff, Commander, Chaplain Corps US Navy
[on behalf of] Israel Meir Lau, Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of Israel
Adar 26, 5753 [19 March 1993]

This prayer for the well-being of the Navy personnel of the INS Eilat was transcribed from a copy provided by Rabbi Lau to Rabbi Resnicoff. In my translation, I use the singular they/their as a gender-neutral pronoun for the divine. --Aharon Varady
