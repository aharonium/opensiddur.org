Avinu shebaShamayim -- Heavenly Father 
who gives strength under governments 
and understanding unto mortals, 
bestow Thy blessings, we pray Thee 
upon Thy beloved servant 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Dukakis">Michael S. Dukakis</a> 
on this memorable moment in his life 
and the life of the Democratic party 
and in the life of our nation. 
Thou has showered upon him 
exceptional gifts of heart, spirit, and intellect, 
of integrity and compassion, 
of fairness and resolute leadership,
of boundless devotion to duty, 
and extraordinary dedication to the families of America.

Tonight his fellow Democrats 
have bestowed their greatest honor upon him 
because he uses these gifts not selfishly 
but to build a better society for all people. 
Grant unto him 
the wisdom to see things 
not only as they are 
but as they ought to be, 
strength to set things right, 
and faith in the possibility of establishing a society  
free of the blight of poverty,
the scandal of homelessness, 
the shame of ignorance, 
the menace of drugs and crime 
and the sin of prejudice.

We pray that this occasion 
serves as an inspiration for all of us 
to unite behind this great and good leader 
in the building of a nation 
where all of its citizens 
of many colors 
and creeds, 
and in many voices 
sing thy praises, O God, 
in amity, 
brotherhood, 
and peace.

Grant unto the delegates gathered here 
a genuine spirit of harmony 
and removed from all hearts 
the animosities that destroy reason 
and the desires that blind the vision of Thy truth.
Unite these delegates in a singleness of purpose 
assuring for all of our citizens 
the blessings of our Democratic heritage 
and endow them with courage and determination 
to fulfill their responsibilities 
honorably to Thee, our nation, and all mankind. 
Strengthen their will 
to do justly, 
to love mercy, 
and to walk humbly before thee.
Let all mankind see 
how good and how pleasant[foot]Audio cuts out here, but the previous line suggests Psalms 133:1.[/foot] [it is 
that brothers dwell together]&nbsp;
and to trust in God in Heaven securely.
