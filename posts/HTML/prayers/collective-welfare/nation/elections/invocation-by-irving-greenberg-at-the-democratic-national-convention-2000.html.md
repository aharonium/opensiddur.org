Loving God, Hashem, creator of the universe,
you created all human beings in your image,[foot]Genesis 1:27.[/foot] 
thereby bestowing upon each of us 
the intrinsic dignities of infinite value, 
equality, 
and uniqueness. 
In Torah teaching, you required us 
to sustain the infinite value of humans 
by overcoming poverty, 
and hunger 
and abolishing war, 
to respect the quality of every human 
by overcoming racism 
and sexism. 
And to uphold the uniqueness of every human being 
by banishing stereotyping 
and discrimination. 
And you have given us humans 
God-like capacities of mind, 
power, 
love, 
and freedom. 
But you asked us to use those God-like capacities 
in partnership with you 
for the purpose to repair, 
heal, 
and complete your broken world.

This week thousands have gathered 
in Los Angeles 
to choose leaders for our nation, 
just as thousands gathered 
in Philadelphia weeks ago 
for this sacred purpose. 
Wherever they met, 
grant the blessing that their work 
rise through ambition and competition 
and beyond special interests 
to attain this standard of <em>tiqun olam</em> -- 
perfecting the world.

Loving God, 
we pray for your servant 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Lieberman">Joseph Lieberman</a> 
with gratitude for his goodness, integrity, 
and the breakthrough which he represents. 
Grant that his values rooted[foot]original reads, "were outrooted."[/foot] in family and faith, 
his ability to hear all sides and to integrate the best, 
be the inspiration to all Americans 
so that all of us will strive continually 
to be on your side 
rather than claim 
that you are on our side. 
Bless and protect him and his wife, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadassah_Lieberman">Hadassah</a>, 
the child of Holocaust survivors. 
May she and the survivors continue to model 
how the memory of suffering inspires us 
to redouble our efforts 
to end the pain of others.
