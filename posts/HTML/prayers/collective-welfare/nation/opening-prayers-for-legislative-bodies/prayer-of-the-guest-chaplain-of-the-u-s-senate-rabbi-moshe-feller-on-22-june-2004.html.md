Almighty God, 
Master of the Universe, 
the Members of the U.S. Senate 
convene here today 
to fulfill one of the seven commandments 
which You first issued to Noaḥ and his family 
after the great flood, 
the command to govern by just laws.

As related in the book of Genesis 
and its sacred commentaries, 
You issued at that time the following seven laws:[foot]Sanhedrin 56a; cf. Tosefta Avodah Zarah 9:4 and Genesis Rabbah 34:8. Six items were commanded to Adam: concerning idolatry, blasphemy, bloodshed, illicit sexuality, theft, and laws…God added to Noah, the law of not eating from the flesh of a live animal.” (Mishneh Torah, Kings and Wars 9:1). The impetus behind sharing the sheva mitsvot in the context of ḤaBaD Lubavitch originates with the following teaching of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson: "We must do everything possible to ensure that the seven Noahide laws are observed. If this can be accomplished through force or through other kinder and more peaceful means through explaining to non-Jews that they should accept God’s wishes [we should do so]…Anyone who is able to influence a non-Jew in any way to keep the seven commandments is obligated to do so, since that is what God commanded Moses our teacher," (“Sheva Mitzvot Shel Benai Noach,” Hapardes 59:9 7-11, 5745).[/foot]&nbsp;

    <li>Not to be cruel to any living creature; and</li>

as the sovereign ruler of all men and all nations. </li>

Almighty God, 
I beseech You today

of our time and of our country, 
the Lubavitcher Rebbe, 
Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson of righteous, blessed memory, 
who passed away 10 years ago today. 
The Rebbe labored 
with great love, 
dedication, 
and self-sacrifice 
to make all mankind aware of Your sacred presence.
