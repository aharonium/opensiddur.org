<blockquote>
<h3>One Minute Speech Given in Recognition of the Guest Chaplain:</h3>

Mr. YATES. Mr. Speaker, I take pride in having presented to the House for the prayer, Rabbi Toby Manewith. She is a constituent of mine from Chicago, where she lived until her graduation from Northwestern University in 1988. She was ordained from Hebrew Union College in 1993.

Her first post was as Hillel Director at Syracuse University, a post she held for 4 years. She took an assignment at American University last summer, where she is now.

Mr. Speaker, it is clear that this young rabbi has much to offer and I know we wish her well.

‘‘The world rests on three things: 
On din, justice, 
on emet, truth 
and on shalom, peace.’’[foot]Pirkei Avot 1.18.[/foot]
This, according to Shimon Ben Gamliel, the first century Jewish sage. Though these concepts are intertwined, 
the first two are valued, in part, as agents; 
it is through them that peace is attained. 
And peace, say the sages, is but another name 
for that which human beings of all walks and stations 
see as divine.

Most Holy One,
May our pursuits be of justice,
And may truth light our way.

our Nation, 
its citizens, 
and citizens of the world, 
be guided on a path
of ever increasing peace.
