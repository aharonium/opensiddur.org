<h3>Welcoming the Guest Chaplain:</h3>
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank the minority leader, and I rise this morning to thank and to welcome Rabbi Yosef Greenberg from Anchorage, AK, who was introduced by the President pro tempore, the Senator from Utah.

This Senator thinks it is important to appreciate and realize that today there is a little bit of history being made. It is the first time we have had a rabbi from the State of Alaska who has been willing and able to provide the morning prayer before the Senate.

The rabbi has led our State for two decades, beginning in 1991, not only leading a small but vibrant Jewish community across the State but also reminding us of the significance of the Jewish culture, the Jewish history, not only to Alaska but throughout the Nation. He has been instrumental in the building of the Jewish cultural center and a museum that recognizes that history and culture. Every year he is truly a leader in the broader community within Anchorage as he brings together people from all faiths at the Jewish Cultural Gala, which is probably one of our more preeminent social gatherings and which is for a good cause.

The leadership of Rabbi Greenberg is not only strong and recognized within the Jewish community but across all faiths within our very broad and inclusive State of Alaska. It is indeed a pleasure to be able to listen to his words, reflect on his words, and thank him for his leadership in my State.

With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I thank the leaders.

In these troubling times, 
when misguided people use religion 
to commit the greatest crimes against humanity 
by stabbing and murdering innocent men, women, and children 
in the Middle East, Europe, Israel, the U.S.A., and all over the world, 
may You grant, Almighty God, 
that the Members of this honorable body 
have the wisdom and courage 
to embody the universal values of the Seven Commandments[foot]Sanhedrin 56a; cf. Tosefta Avodah Zarah 9:4 and Genesis Rabbah 34:8. Six items were commanded to Adam: concerning idolatry, blasphemy, bloodshed, illicit sexuality, theft, and laws…God added to Noah, the law of not eating from the flesh of a live animal.” (Mishneh Torah, Kings and Wars 9:1). The impetus behind sharing the sheva mitsvot in the context of ḤaBaD Lubavitch originates with the following teaching of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson: "We must do everything possible to ensure that the seven Noahide laws are observed. If this can be accomplished through force or through other kinder and more peaceful means through explaining to non-Jews that they should accept God’s wishes [we should do so]…Anyone who is able to influence a non-Jew in any way to keep the seven commandments is obligated to do so, since that is what God commanded Moses our teacher," (“Sheva Mitzvot Shel Benai Noach,” Hapardes 59:9 7-11, 5745).[/foot]&nbsp; 
which You, Almighty God, 
issued to Noaḥ and his family after the Great Flood, 
the foremost of which is not to commit murder.

Grant, Almighty God, 
that the Members of the Senate, who assembled here today, 
to fulfill one of Your Seven Commandments, 
the Commandment to govern by just laws, 
understand that the United States has the ability 
to lead the entire world 
and be a role model 
in spreading and incorporating Your Seven Laws, 
and in doing so, 
have the power to bring healing and peace

who launched the universal campaign
