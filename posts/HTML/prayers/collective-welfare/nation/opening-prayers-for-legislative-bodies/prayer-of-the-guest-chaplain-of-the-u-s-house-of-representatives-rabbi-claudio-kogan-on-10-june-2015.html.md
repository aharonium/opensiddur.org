<blockquote>
<h3>One Minute Speech Given in Recognition of the Guest Chaplain:</h3>
Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Rabbi Claudio Kogan from Temple Emanuel in McAllen, Texas, for his service today as guest chaplain.

A native of Argentina, Rabbi Kogan and his wife, Anna, immigrated to the United States where he continued his studies, receiving several master's degrees.

Rabbi Kogan has served congregations all over the United States. He has worked to develop a strong interfaith connection with his Christian and Muslim counterparts. He has received numerous awards for his essays on religion and ethics.

In addition to his rabbinical duties, Rabbi Kogan is also a medical doctor. He has been a high school teacher in Cincinnati, Ohio, and has combined his religious and medical training by serving as a hospital chaplain at a variety of institutions.

Rabbi Kogan is joined here today by his lovely wife, Anna, and his two beautiful children, Milena and Ezekiel.

I want to thank him for his prayer and for his service to my community.

In this great Hall where dreams come true, 
we ask Your blessings upon these great men and women, 
the Representatives of the people. 
They have devoted their lives to our welfare. 
Give them wisdom and courage. 
Inspire them with the teachings of our prophets, 
as they answer Isaiah's call 
to feed the hungry and clothe the naked,[foot]Cf. Isaiah 58:6-11[/foot]
Jeremiah's request 
to protect the orphan and the widow,[foot]Cf. Jeremiah 22:3[/foot]
and Ezekiel's plea 
to lift up those who cannot stand on their own[foot]Reference unknown. Cf. Psalms 145:14 and Exodus 23:5. Perhaps the end of Ezekiel 21:31? If you know the reference, please let us know in the comments.[/foot]

As an immigrant who came to this country 16 years ago

I join this House in a prayer

the people of the United States of America, 
are privileged to enjoy. 
I ask You, God, 
to let the lights of truth and harmony 
shine from this Chamber 
as beacons for the betterment of all Americans.
