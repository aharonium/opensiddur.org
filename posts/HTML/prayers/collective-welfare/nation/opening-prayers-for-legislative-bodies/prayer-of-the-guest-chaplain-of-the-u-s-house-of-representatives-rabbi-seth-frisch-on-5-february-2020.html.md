<blockquote>
<h3>One Minute Speech Given in Recognition of the Guest Chaplain:</h3>

Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to welcome Rabbi Seth Frisch, who delivered today's opening prayer to the people's House.

Since his ordination in 1986, at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York, Rabbi Frisch has been a source of comfort and counsel to Jews around the world. In his current posting as rabbi and teacher of the New Shul of Philadelphia, Rabbi Frisch helps serve as a guide for those who want to learn more about what it means to be Jewish in a safe and supporting setting.

In a way, today's opening prayer was a homecoming for Rabbi Frisch, who previously served as a legislative assistant to the chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.

I pray that we will all heed his words today, that out of many, we are one Nation. Let us strive to put our divisions behind us and realize our dream of a country indivisible with liberty and justice for all.

Almighty, 
I stand before You in prayer and in memory 
as I am reminded of Solomon, King of ancient Israel, 
who would preside over a most unusual judicial hearing, 
one in which two mothers 
would lay claim to the life of one child, 
a child they each would insist to be their own.[foot]1 Kings 3:16-28.[/foot]

This parable allows us 
to see Solomon's wisdom 
as preserving the nation, 
as we are sadly reminded, 
so soon after his death, 
that the kingdom is split asunder.

I, too, am reminded of Abraham Lincoln, 
when he spoke with prophetic-like prescience: 
"A house divided cannot stand,"[foot]from Abraham Lincoln's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln%27s_House_Divided_Speech">House Divided</a> speech, June 16, 1858.[/foot]&nbsp;
which was soon to become a war 
of brother against brother. 
From this we would soon learn 
that our future lies not in enmity, 
but in unity.

For, Lord, 
the Book of Leviticus, from Your Torah, teaches us
