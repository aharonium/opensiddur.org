<blockquote>
<h3>One Minute Speech Given in Recognition of the Guest Chaplain:</h3>

Mrs. KELLY. Mr. Speaker, Rabbi Milton Balkany, Dean of Bais Yaakov in Brooklyn, New York, is an acquaintance of mine. He has been an active participant and leader in the Jewish community in New York City for many, many years. Rabbi Balkany has worked hard to bring the community together in order to continue traditional religious and cultural values. Not only does he help younger generations understand the intrinsic and extraordinary Jewish culture to which they belong, but he also welcomes others of all religions to engage in prayer, meditation and community.

I applaud you, Rabbi, on this special occasion and welcome you as the guest chaplain of the House of Representatives.
