Sponsor: Rep. Eugene Clay Shaw Jr. (R-FL)
Date of Prayer: 2006-09-14

<blockquote>
Mr. SHAW. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased and I am most honored today to welcome Rabbi Amy Rader and her family here to Washington, DC.

Rabbi Rader is an excellent leader and role model for the Jewish community, and for people of all beliefs. I proudly nominated her to share her faith and offer her prayers for our country on the House floor this morning, and I thank her for coming.

After having studied in both Jerusalem and Los Angeles, Rabbi Rader was ordained by the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York City in 1999. Rabbi Rader also served as the rabbi for the Lakeland Hills Jewish Center in New Jersey, and was the first Jewish chaplain at Methodist Hospital in her hometown of Minneapolis.

Rabbi Rader is now an associate rabbi at B'nai Torah Congregation in Boca Raton, where she directs their mitsvah program. In her 4 years in the Boca Raton community, Rabbi Rader has earned a reputation as a compassionate pastoral counselor as well as an inspiring teacher and lecturer. I am honored to have her here with us today.

[Rabbi Rader was also honored with <a href="https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/9/15/extensions-of-remarks-section/article/e1741-1">a tribute</a> by Rep. Robert Ira Wexler (D-FL).]

Legs are not lips and walking is not kneeling. And yet our legs uttered songs. Even without words, our march was worship. I felt my legs were praying."[/foot]

Esteemed men and women in this Chamber, 
I ask for God's help 
to move our prayers 
from our lips to our feet. 
Our world is in desperate need of action, 
change, 
and presence. 
As the leaders of this sacred democracy, 
your feet in any one place 
can make the difference 
between life and death.
