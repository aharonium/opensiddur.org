Almighty God of freedom, 
who gave us the promise and the dream of liberty 
to be proclaimed throughout the land, 
we pause before this session 
to recall words spoken by a Senate nominee--
Abe Lincoln--
on this day, June 16, in 1858. 
"A nation divided against itself cannot stand," he said, 
and we "cannot endure half slave, half free."

O Lord our God and God of generations past, 
we offer thanks for all the progress we have made 
since that historic speech, 
even as we recognize we still have more to do. 
Slavery, the institution, is no more. 
But let us unite in our resolve 
that none should be enslaved by prejudice or hatred 
that threatens the humanity and dignity 
we have fought to recognize and guarantee; 
that none, 
victimized by ignorance or discrimination, 
live lives half slave, 
half free.

Grant us and all our leaders 
the wisdom to debate and disagree, 
with civility and respect, 
the issues of the day. 
But give us, we pray, 
the wisdom and the faith we need 
to safeguard a nation united, not divided--
indivisible,
as we pledge--
in our pursuit of liberty and justice for us all.
