Guest Chaplain: Rabbi Steven Abraham, Beth El Synagogue, Omaha, Nebraska
Sponsor: Rep. Don Bacon (R-NE-02)
Date of Prayer: 2019-11-20

<blockquote>
Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my appreciation for my friend, Rabbi Steven Abraham, and thank him for leading today's session with the opening prayer. I would also like to welcome his family to this House that belongs to all Americans.

Rabbi Abraham has been the rabbi for Beth El Synagogue since 2013, after moving to Omaha to be the assistant rabbi in 2011. He graduated from rabbinical school at the Jewish Theological Seminary, where he also received a masters of arts in Jewish education. He is also an alumnus of the University of Baltimore.

Since I came to Congress in 2017, Rabbi Abraham has been a trusted friend and adviser for both my staff and me.

I call on all of us to heed the words offered in prayer by the rabbi. We must all humble ourselves to the wisdom of the Almighty, and let us always try to be a voice for the voiceless and serve with compassion and courage.

We face many challenges ahead, but with prayerfulness and good faith in one another, I know we can rise above the trials of today in search of a better tomorrow, all for the sake of our country.

Thank you again, Rabbi Abraham, for being a genuine leader and for being with us today.
