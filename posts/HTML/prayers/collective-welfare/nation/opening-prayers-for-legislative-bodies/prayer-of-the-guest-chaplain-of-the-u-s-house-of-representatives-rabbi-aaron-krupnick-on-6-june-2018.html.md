Guest Chaplain: Rabbi Aaron Krupnick, Congregation Beth El, Voorhees, NJ
Sponsor: Rep. Donald Norcross, (D-NJ)
Date of Prayer: 06/06/2018

<blockquote>
<h3>One Minute Speech Given in Recognition of the Guest Chaplain:</h3>
Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to welcome our guest chaplain, Rabbi Aaron Krupnick of Congregation Beth El in Voorhees, New Jersey.

The congregation has been part of our South Jersey community since 1920, when it was originally founded in Camden City.

Now it offers a spiritual home for hundreds of Jewish families in South Jersey.

Rabbi Krupnick came to our community in 1994 from Montgomery, Alabama. There, he helped lead interfaith services with leaders like Martin Luther King, III, and Rosa Parks.

As you heard in his prayer, he often discusses patience, understanding, kindness, compassion.

In a world where religion too often creates so much conflict, Rabbi Krupnick focuses on togetherness. He knows there is more that connects us than divides us.

I have been fortunate enough to attend services and seder at Beth El. I have witnessed firsthand how the community is welcoming, loving, and supportive of all.

Mr. Speaker, today I am honored to welcome Rabbi Krupnick to the House of Representatives and I thank him for his offering of this morning's prayer.

His compassion, his teachings, his strong leadership have helped foster a vibrant Jewish community in our region, and I know it will stay that way for years to come.

Our God and God of our ancestors:
On the long road to freedom from Egypt, 
You led 12 diverse tribes, 
instructing each to march under their own banner. 
They did not always see eye to eye, 
but they could, nonetheless, 
walk shoulder to shoulder.

Dear Lord, help the Members of this Congress 
to be ever mindful of the fact that the right to disagree 
is fundamental to our democracy. 
Foster in them the art of disagreement 
that the Jewish people have been practicing for millennia. 
Enable them to grant their adversaries moral respect; 
to give those of opposing opinions the intellectual benefit of doubt; 
to have sympathy for their motives 
and listen with empathy to their lines of reasoning.

Endow them with discernment and wisdom, 
patience and understanding, 
kindness and compassion. 
Let them walk humbly before those who they serve 
and thereby bring us all that much closer to You 
and to one another. 
God, bless this great Nation 
and those who lead it.
