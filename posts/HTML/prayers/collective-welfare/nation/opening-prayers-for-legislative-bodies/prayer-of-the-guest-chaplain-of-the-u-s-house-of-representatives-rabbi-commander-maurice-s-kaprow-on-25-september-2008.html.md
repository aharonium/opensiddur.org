Eternal and loving God, 
this morning, 
in this august Chamber of the Senate, 
we ask humbly for Your guidance and grace. 
As these men and women, 
duly empowered by their constituents, 
meet to deliberate the important issues facing our Nation and our world, 
we turn to You to help them complete their work. 
Grant them wisdom to fully understand the issues before them; 
grant them insight to truly know the implications of their actions; 
grant them confidence to feel that what they are doing is right; 
and grant them the courage to make those difficult decisions. 
Be with them today and every day as they fully ponder the affairs of state.

While we are here 
in the comfort and safety 
of this magnificent and historic Capitol Building, 
our thoughts turn to those brave Americans-- 
young men and women from every part of our country--
who volunteer to serve in our Armed Forces. 
They are soldiers, marines, sailors, airmen, and coastguardsmen. 
Many of these brave souls are deployed far from home, 
in harm's way, 
as they do their part in maintaining freedom 
and our American way of life. 
Keep them safe and secure 
until they return to these shores 
ensconced into the waiting arms 
of their families and loved ones.
