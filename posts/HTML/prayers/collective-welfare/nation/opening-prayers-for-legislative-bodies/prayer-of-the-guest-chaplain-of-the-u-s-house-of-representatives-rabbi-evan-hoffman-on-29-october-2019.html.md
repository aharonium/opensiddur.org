<h3>One Minute Speech Given in Recognition of the Guest Chaplain:</h3>

Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank my dear friend and constituent, Rabbi Evan Hoffman, for giving the opening prayer today.

Rabbi Hoffman has led Congregation Anshe Sholom in New Rochelle, New York, since 2012. He graduated Yeshiva College summa cum laude, where he received ordination from Rabbi Isaac Elchanan's Theological Seminary.

Rabbi Hoffman is an accomplished author, writing the weekly essay series titled "Thoughts on the Parashah," as well as the editor of English language publications for Talmud Israeli.

Rabbi Hoffman was raised in Great Neck, New York, and is an avid New York Mets fan. Rabbi Hoffman and his wife, Sari, are the proud parents of two wonderful children, Eliyahu and Elana.

Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for the wonderful prayer this morning.
