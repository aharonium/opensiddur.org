<blockquote>
<h3>One Minute Speech Given in Recognition of the Guest Chaplain:</h3>
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and introduce a good friend and community leader in my home district, Rabbi Joshua Gruenberg, and to thank him for offering today's invocation.

Rabbi Gruenberg made the trip here to the Nation's Capital with his wife, Elissa, and his two children, Kayla and Samuel. I am proud and pleased to welcome the rabbi and his family to the House of Representatives.

Rabbi Gruenberg is the chief spiritual leader at Temple Beth El in Yardley, Pennsylvania. Since he joined the temple in 2011, I have gotten to know the rabbi quite well. He has participated in several of my local roundtable discussions on issues, including Israel and the Middle East, and has come down to Washington to visit with me and to offer counsel.

Rabbi Gruenberg is a warm and welcoming Bucks County leader. He has helped build on a strong foundation at Temple Beth El that will last for decades to come.

I am proud of the work he has done in our community and am privileged to call him my friend.
