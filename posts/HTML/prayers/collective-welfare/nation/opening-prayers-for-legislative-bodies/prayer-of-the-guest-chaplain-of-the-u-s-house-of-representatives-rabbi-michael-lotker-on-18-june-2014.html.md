<blockquote>
<h3>One Minute Speech Given in Recognition of the Guest Chaplain:</h3>
Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Mr. Speaker, it is my great privilege to welcome a very good friend, Rabbi Michael Lotker, to be the guest chaplain of the House of Representatives today.

Rabbi Lotker is a teacher and a leader in Ventura County. He is the rabbi emeritus at Temple Ner Ami in Camarillo, California; the rabbi of Congregation Khilat HaAloneem in Ojai, California; and the community rabbi and teacher for the Jewish Federation of Ventura County. He is also a member of the Central Conference of American Rabbis and the Board of Rabbis of Southern California.

In addition to his work as a rabbi, Rabbi Lotker is an author and a physicist, with a focus on researching alternative energy sources such as wind, solar, and geothermal.

Known for his quick–witted humor, Rabbi Lotker writes parody songs for each of the Jewish holidays throughout the year.

For his spiritual leadership and thoughtful words, I would like to thank Rabbi Lotker for leading us in prayer today. ;
