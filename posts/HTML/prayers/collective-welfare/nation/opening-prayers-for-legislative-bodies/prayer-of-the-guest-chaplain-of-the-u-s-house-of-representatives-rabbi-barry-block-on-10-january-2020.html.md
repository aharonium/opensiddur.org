<blockquote>
<h3>One Minute Speech Given in Recognition of the Guest Chaplain:</h3>

Mr. Speaker, today I rise with my friend John Boozman, former Member of this House and now a Senator from Arkansas, to welcome today's guest chaplain, my dear friend, Rabbi Barry Block of Congregation B'nai Israel in Little Rock, Arkansas.

Realizing his love for reformed Judaism at a young age, Rabbi Block earned his master of arts in Hebrew letters from Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion before being ordained 3 years following completion of his degree.

Having devoted much of his life to the church, Rabbi Block found his way to Congregation B'nai Israel in my hometown of Little Rock, Arkansas, in 2013, after serving over 20 years at Temple Beth-El in San Antonio, Texas.

He has served Reform Judaism nationally and regionally as a member of the Board of the Central Conference of American Rabbis and chair of its resolutions and nominating committees and as president of the Southwest Association of Reform Rabbis.

He is the loving father of his two sons, Robert and Daniel.

I want to thank Rabbi Block for his gracing us with a wonderful opening prayer and wish him, his family, and his congregation continued success in our community of Little Rock.
