O God, who made a world of change, 
You challenged us to change the world. 
You gave us dreams of better times 
and the power to pursue those dreams, 
to do our part to make a difference 
and help those dreams come true.

Earlier this week we set aside a day 
to recall that there are those who seek to kill the dreamers, 
and thereby kill the dreams. 
But we will remember dreamers, those who had a dream, 
and through our work--
through the courage and determination of Americans of all faiths and colors--
we will embrace the dreams that make our Nation strong, 
that make us a force for hope and good[foot]The Congressional Record has "freedom" here instead of "good."[/foot] throughout the world.

Almighty God, 
at a time when others say around the world that all is hopeless, 
that things will never change, 
we roll up our sleeves as this session now begins 
and remind ourselves 
that how we act does matter and what we do does count. 
Through our leaders here, 
through Americans from sea to shining sea--
and of course, 
through those in our Nation's Armed Forces 
whose faith and courage must sustain them in harm's way--
we will keep the dreams alive, 
to build a land where liberty will be proclaimed, 
where justice rolls like mighty waters, 
where all shall live in freedom--
and, one day, 
where none shall be afraid.
