<blockquote>
<h3>One Minute Speech Given in Recognition of the Guest Chaplain:</h3>

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment of the Senate's time to particularly acknowledge the presence of our guest Chaplain, Gerald Kane, who is the Rabbi of Temple Beth-El in Las Cruces, NM.

Rabbi Kane was ordained first in Cincinnati in 1970 at the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion. He has served pulpits in Portland, OR, New Orleans, Phoenix, and in Kansas City, before coming to Las Cruces some 3 years ago.

Las Cruces is the second largest city in my home State of New Mexico, a very vibrant, growing metropolitan area. It is one of only five communities in New Mexico that has a synagogue. It has the third synagogue that was built in our State.

Our Jewish community has always had a special role in the life of Las Cruces. Three of the mayors of that city have been of the Jewish faith.

Following the September 11 attacks, Rabbi Kane, together with other religious leaders in Las Cruces, issued a statement of unity and support at the Las Cruces Islamic Center. He has coordinated clergy participation in this year following 9/11, and has worked very hard to bring the community together in that regard.

We are very proud that he is here. In talking with him this morning, we were at a loss to think when we last had a clergyman from New Mexico as our guest Chaplain in the Senate. But it is entirely appropriate that we do today.

I am very honored that Rabbi Kane was able to be with us.

Also, I wish to acknowledge the presence of his wife Cyrille, who is here with him. They have four children and nine grandchildren.

Let me also acknowledge the very good work of one of the staff people who works with me, Jeff Steinborn, who works in our Las Cruces office and who helped make the arrangements today for Rabbi Kane to be here.

"And so it is with us," 
the author of the parable concludes. 
"When we go our separate ways, 
we may go astray. 
Let us join hands 
and look for the path 
out of the darkness 
together."[foot]This parable is derived from a famous story relayed by the ḥassidic rebbe of Tzantz, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaim_Halberstam">Ḥayyim Halberstam</a> (1793–1876). This particular variation is given (uncredited alas) in <em>The New Union Prayer Book</em> (ed. Chaim Stern, 1975) p.349-350. Stern may have first learned the story via Martin Buber. Here is the psychotherapist and author, Sheldon Kopp, making reference to the story in an article on Hasidic Psychotherapy: "[In explaining the relationship of a Ḥasid to a Rebbe, Martin Buber] tells the story of Rabbi Hayyim, who described his followers as being like men lost in a forest. They find a man who has been lost even longer than they have, and ask him to show them how to get out of the forest. His reply is 'That I cannot do. But I can point out the ways that lead further into the thicket, and after that, let us try to find the way together'" (Jewish Standard, July 30, 1970).[/foot]
