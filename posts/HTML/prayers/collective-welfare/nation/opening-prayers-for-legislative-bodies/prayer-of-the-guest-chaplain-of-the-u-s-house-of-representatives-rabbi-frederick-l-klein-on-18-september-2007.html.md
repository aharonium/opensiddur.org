<blockquote>
<h3>One Minute Speech Given in Recognition of the Guest Chaplain:</h3>

Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commend my good friend, Rabbi Fred Klein, for his uplifting prayer that he delivered for us this morning, as well as for his tireless efforts to strengthen the Jewish community in my home district of South Florida.

Rabbi Klein serves as the Director of Community Chaplaincy at the Greater Miami Jewish Federation and is the Executive Vice President of the Rabbinical Association of Greater Miami. In these roles, Rabbi Klein offers counsel to the physically and mentally ill in their greatest times of need.

I have long been aware of Rabbi Klein's commitment and contributions to academia, to the Jewish community, and the social welfare of all of South Florida. But his greatest achievement, Mr. Speaker, is his family, including his four children, Moshe who is 11, Shuli who is 9, Benny is 6 years old, and Aryeh almost 4.

The opening prayer that Rabbi Klein delivered today reflects his intellectual fiber, as well as his determination to improve our community and our country. I thank Rabbi Klein for his invocation, and I look forward to working with him in the years ahead.

Oh God who knows 
the hidden chambers 
of the human heart.
Last week 
Jews worldwide 
prayed during Rosh Hashanah, 
the Jewish new year.
Just as Jews prayed 
for renewed clarity, 
purpose, 
and conviction, 
I ask you, 
all discerning God, 
to awaken within all our hearts 
the spirit of renewal.

Open our eyes 
to see the suffering and needs of others. 
Lead our feet 
down the path of righteousness. 
Cause our necks 
to be flexible in order to change course when necessary. 
Unblock our ears 
to hear the perspectives and opinions of others. 
But most importantly, 
open our hearts, 
and remind us of our loftiest visions 
for ourselves, 
and for our great country.
