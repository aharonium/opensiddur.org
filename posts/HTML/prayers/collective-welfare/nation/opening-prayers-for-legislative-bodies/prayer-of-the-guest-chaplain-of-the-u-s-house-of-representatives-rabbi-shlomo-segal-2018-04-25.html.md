<blockquote>
<h3>One Minute Speech Given in Recognition of the Guest Chaplain:</h3>

Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to welcome our guest chaplain, Rabbi Shlomo Segal of Kehilat Moshe synagogue from Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. Rabbi Segal and his wife, Adina, founded the synagogue 5 years ago, and they have since created a vibrant community not only for the diverse group of Jews who attend their services, but for people of all faiths throughout Brooklyn.

Rabbi Segal is a leader in our community who works hard to build bridges of understanding and tolerance. He serves on the board of governors of the New York Board of Rabbis and is a rabbinical consultant to the Kings Bay Y, a Jewish community center in the Eighth Congressional District that I proudly represent.

Through his work, he celebrates the diversity of Brooklyn, bringing together different religious and ethnic groups to emphasize what we all have in common––as New Yorkers and as Americans and, most importantly, as human beings.

Rabbi Segal has brought together Jews, Christians, and Muslims to breakfast for Ramadan and worked hard to bring together and strengthen ties between the Black and Jewish communities of central Brooklyn. Rabbi Segal's efforts are geared toward making religion the greatest possible force that it can be in our community and in our Nation.

He is here today with his wonderful wife, Adina, and two tremendous children, Shira and Rayna. It is my honor to welcome them to the People's House and to our Nation's Capitol.
