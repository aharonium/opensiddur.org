Almighty God, Father of us all, 
in the presence of the manifestations of Thy supreme greatness 
we humbly bow the head and exclaim, 
“Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of Hosts; 
full is the whole earth of His glory.”[foot]Isaiah 6:3.[/foot]

We thank Thee 
for every noble thought that has been thought, 
for every unselfish deed that has been performed, 
for every inspiring word that has been spoken among men. 
We thank Thee above all 
for this dear fatherland of ours, 
the promised land of these latter days, 
the new Canaan, 
where modern prophets have preached 
truths no less inspiring than those spoken 
by Thy chosen messengers of old, 
where ideals have been set 
that point to the era of universal brotherhood and peace, 
the hope of all the great spirits of the race. 
To these ideals may we all remain true.

May those who guide the helm of our ship of state 
be constantly mindful of the high mission of this American people 
among the nations of the earth 
to stand as the exemplar of justice, 
the protector of the weak, 
the foe of all unrighteousness, 
the scorner of all wrongdoing, 
the lover of peace. 
So imbue all with these ideals 
that our dear land may stand to the very end 
as the refuge of all those oppressed elsewhere, 
the sanctuary of liberty, 
the haven of peace.
