O Lord, who hears our prayers 
as this session now begins 
and before the leaders here debate the issues they confront 
and with which our country and our people struggle, 
we begin united, united with a prayer, 
a reminder 
that even as we disagree on one course of action or the next, 
we do so in pursuit of common prayers, common dreams--
liberty, dignity, and freedom--
that unite us all.

We sometimes call this starting prayer an invocation, 
but it is not Your presence we invoke, 
for You are always with us. 
No matter where we are or where we go, 
as we soar on eagle's wings toward heaven, 
as we search the deepest reaches of the sea, 
or as we seek to balance right and responsibility 
through the actions taken here in the Halls of Congress, 
we know we find Your hand.

</span></div></td>
 
<td style="vertical-align:top;">
<div class="english" lang="en">
Instead, it is awareness of Your presence 
that we call forth, 
that we invoke a reminder of a plan or dream 
in which we might play a part, 
a promise of a better world, 
better time, 
a time of peace and justice 
that we might help to build.

May Your presence touch our lives, 
and even shape our words, 
so that we might find the wisdom and the courage 
to do our part to keep our dreams and prayers alive 
and help make those dreams and prayers come true.
