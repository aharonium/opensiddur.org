<blockquote>
<h3>One Minute Speech Given in Recognition of the Guest Chaplain:</h3>

Mr. HIMES. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

It is a thrill and an honor this morning on this propitious day in which a joint session of the United States Congress will be addressed by Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel to introduce and welcome our guest chaplain of the day, Rabbi Jeremy Wiederhorn. Rabbi Wiederhorn is a friend, he is the spiritual leader of The Conservative Synagogue of Westport, and has been so since 2008. Prior to doing that, he gave service in Henderson, Nevada, for 8 years. He is a leader in the community and in his synagogue. He is also true to the ministry dictated by his and so many of our faiths, including, over time, having led and mobilized his community to send an emergency mission to Israel in response to the missile strikes from Hamas in Gaza.

It is a real honor. I know Rabbi Wiederhorn has served as an important leader in Westport and throughout Fairfield County. He has served as a friend to me. I would say that in addition to his spiritual guidance, he introduced me to cholent, which for this Presbyterian was a new experience. I think I thank him for introducing me to that part of his history and culture, if not exactly for the culinary experience.

Welcome, Rabbi Wiederhorn.
