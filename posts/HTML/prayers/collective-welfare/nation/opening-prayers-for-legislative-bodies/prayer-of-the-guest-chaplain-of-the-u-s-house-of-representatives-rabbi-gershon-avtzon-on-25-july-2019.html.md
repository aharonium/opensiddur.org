<h3>One Minute Speech Given in Recognition of the Guest Chaplain:</h3>

Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the rabbi for coming to the Capitol today to share with us a time in prayer, a time when we often need it.

America has been through many battles. We have many debates. But we always come out strong, and we come out together, at the end of the day.
  
I thank the rabbi for his kind prayer and thoughtfulness as we proceed forward as a Nation.

Almighty God, master of the universe, 
I invoke Your blessing today 
on the Members of this honorable institution, 
the House of Representatives of the United States of America. 
May they humbly serve their constituencies, 
aware that creating just legislation is one of the Seven Laws 
that You, almighty God, gave all humanity through Noaḥ, 
as detailed in Genesis.[foot]The Sheva Mitsvot Bnei Noaḥ are first enumerated here: Genesis Rabbah 34:8, Tosefta Avodah Zarah 8:4, and Sanhedrin 56a. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Laws_of_Noah">wikipedia</a>; <a href="https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/the-noahide-laws/">myjewishlearning</a>). In the opinion of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, zt"l, "We must do everything possible to ensure that the seven Noahide laws are observed. If this can be accomplished through force or through other kinder and more peaceful means through explaining to non-Jews that they should accept God’s wishes [we should do so]...Anyone who is able to influence a non-Jew in any way to keep the seven commandments is obligated to do so, since that is what God commanded Moses our teacher" (“Sheva Mitzvot Shel Benai Noaḥ,” HaPardes 59:9 7-11, 5745).[/foot]

Almighty God,

includes differences of opinion and rigorous debate,
