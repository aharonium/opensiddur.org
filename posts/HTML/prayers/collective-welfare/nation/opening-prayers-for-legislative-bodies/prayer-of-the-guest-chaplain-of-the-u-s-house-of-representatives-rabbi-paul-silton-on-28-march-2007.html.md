<h3>One Minute Speech Given in Recognition of the Guest Chaplain:</h3>

Mr. McNULTY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to welcome my very dear friend, Dr. Rabbi Paul Silton, and to thank him for offering the opening prayer this morning for the United States House of Representatives.

Rabbi Silton has served the community of New York's Capital Region for over 30 years as Rabbi of Temple Israel, the largest conservative synagogue in northeastern New York. He began his career at Temple Israel as the education director where he was responsible for fostering growth at every education level, including the addition of an adult education program.

Rabbi Silton has made enormous contributions not just to Temple Israel, but to the entire community. He founded the Holocaust Survivors and Friends in Pursuit of Justice. He also hosted a 3-day National Holocaust Conference for 1,500 participants at Temple Israel.

He has also organized a multitude of services for the community Kristallnacht and the Holocaust Memorial commemorations.

Through the efforts of Dr. Rabbi Paul Silton, Temple Israel has received numerous awards from the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, in addition to education awards for programming, high school education, and the Framework for Excellent Synagogue School Program Award.

I am proud to welcome my very dear friend, Dr. Rabbi Paul Silton this morning, and to thank him on behalf of the entire United States House of Representatives.
