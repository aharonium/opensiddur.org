Almighty God, Creator and Ruler of the universe,

this first convention of Jewish women 
has been permitted to assemble, 
accept our thanks, 
and hearken, O Lord, to our prayer.

In times past, 
when storms of cruel persecution 
drove us toward the reefs of adversity, 
seemingly overwhelmed by misfortune, 
we had faith in Thee and Thy works, 
ever trusting and believing 
that Thou ordainest all things well. 
Because of this faith, 
we feel that Thou hast, 
in the course of events, 
caused this glorious congress to convene, 
that it may give expression to that which shall 
spread broadcast a knowledge of Thee and Thy deeds.

Grant, then, Thy blessing upon those assembled, 
and upon the object of their meeting. 
May the peculiar circumstances, 
which have brought together, under one roof, 
both Catholic and Jew, 
who, for centuries, have been seeking to serve Thee, 
though in different ways, 
be a promise of future peace. 
Grant, we beseech Thee, 
that this convention may be productive of that 
which is in accordance with Thy will.

Bless, O Lord, 
this our country and the President thereof, 
and all the people of the land. 
May love and peace be the heritage of men, 
to remain with them forever. 
<em>Amen</em>.
