Eternal One, 
Rock of all ages, 
help us to hear 
the voices of our forebears

Let us draw devotional inspiration 
this morning 
from the life of Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise, 
founder of the Hebrew Union College, 
who led this Senate in prayer 
135 years ago to this very week. 
May one brief moment 
from the life of this famed American clergyman 
renew in us a commitment 
to the core of righteous living.

For we have been taught that once, 
when this rabbi took ill amidst a class 
and was compelled to descend from his teaching platform, 
a young, eager student jumped up, 
grabbed his arm, 
and said: "May I help you down, Doctor?"

In response to this question, 
the rabbi uttered words 
that remind us anew 
of what is good 
and what God does require of us all: 
"Never help a person down,"
the rabbi told his student. 
"Try always to help people up."

In this year, 
marking 350 years of Jewish life in America,

our prayerful and reverential gratitude 
to the Source of Life 
for implanting within our hearts 
the vision of our noble Republic, 
ever striving to help people up.

O may all who labor in this House--

be inspired anew 
by the prophet Micah's exhortation, 
a charge that the father of this Nation 
deeply cherished

"Do justly, 
love mercy, 
and walk humbly with thy God."[foot]Micah 6:8 part.[/foot]
