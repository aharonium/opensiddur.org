Guest Chaplain: Rabbi Mendy Greenberg, Director of Mat-Su Jewish Center, Chabad-Lubavitch, in Palmer, Alaska
Date of Prayer: 31 March 2022

<blockquote>
<h3>One Minute Speech Given in Recognition of the Guest Chaplain:</h3>
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, thank you for allowing me to open the Senate with you. It was a true honor to have Rabbi Mendy Greenberg, who is doing amazing work in Palmer, Alaska, open the Senate with his very powerful and meaningful prayer and very appropriate prayer for what is happening in the world.

I just want to say a little bit about our incredible Jewish community in Alaska. Rabbi Greenberg's parents are actually up in the Gallery watching--his father, Rabbi Greenberg and his incredible wife, Esti.

I just want to say what they do for our--community--communities throughout Alaska--is so powerful, so meaningful, and touches so many lives way beyond the Jewish community of Alaska--way beyond that community. I love the phrase referring to our wonderful Jewish community of Alaska, the "frozen chosen," because it is a little cold in our State, as most Americans know.

But here is the thing about this community: They are incredible in terms of bringing all Alaskans together. We have this annual event called the Jewish Gala that has hundreds and hundreds of Alaskans of all faiths who participate in this every year. It is one of my favorite things to do as an Alaskan, to come and celebrate not just the Jewish community, but the spirit of togetherness, the spirit of faith, and the spirit of taking care of one another. That is what this incredible community does, led by both Rabbi Greenbergs, who we saw the younger today give this very powerful prayer.

I want to thank him and his parents for being here today. It is not always easy to get to DC from Alaska--a couple of thousand miles at least. To our Jewish community back home, to the Greenbergs for all they have done, I just want to, on the Senate floor here, offer my deepest thanks for the example they set for the entire State of Alaska. It is great having them here, and what they do for our State is really powerful, really important.

Thank you, Madam President, for allowing me to participate in the opening and the prayer this morning.

Almighty God, Master of the Universe,

May You, Almighty God, 
grant the Members of this honorable body 
wisdom and understanding 
that the ultimate way to eliminate the cause of war 
and bring true peace to the world 
is by embodying the universal values of the seven commandments[foot]Sanhedrin 56a; cf. Tosefta Avodah Zarah 8:4 and Genesis Rabbah 34:8. Six items were commanded to Adam: concerning idolatry, blasphemy, bloodshed, illicit sexuality, theft, and laws…God added to Noah, the law of not eating from the flesh of a live animal.” (Maimonides, Laws of Kings 9:1). The impetus behind sharing the sheva mitsvot in the context of ḤaBaD Lubavitch originates with the following teaching of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson: "We must do everything possible to ensure that the seven Noahide laws are observed. If this can be accomplished through force or through other kinder and more peaceful means through explaining to non-Jews that they should accept God’s wishes [we should do so]…Anyone who is able to influence a non-Jew in any way to keep the seven commandments is obligated to do so, since that is what God commanded Moses our teacher," (“Sheva Mitzvot Shel Benai Noach,” Hapardes 59:9 7-11, 5745).[/foot]&nbsp;  
issued to Noaḥ after the great flood, 
foremost of which is not to commit murder.
