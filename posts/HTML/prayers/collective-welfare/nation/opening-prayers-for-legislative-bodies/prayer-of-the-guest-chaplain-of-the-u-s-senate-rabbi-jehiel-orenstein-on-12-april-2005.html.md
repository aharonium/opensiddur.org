HON. BILL PASCRELL, JR. of New Jersey 
in the House of Representatives
Tuesday, April 12, 2005

Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the career and accomplishments of Rabbi Jehiel Orenstein. Rabbi Orenstein is a beloved figure not only among the 575 families at Congregation Beth EL, but throughout the community at-large.

In 1961, Jehiel Orenstein received his master's degree in Judaica and was ordained as a Rabbi at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. While he was a student there, he received the Lawrence Prager Award for outstanding scholarship in medieval Hebrew Literature. In 1986, Rabbi Orenstein received his PhD from New York University in linguistics. In that same year, he was awarded the degree of Doctor of Divinity from the Jewish Theological Seminary of America.

Rabbi Orenstein served as Chaplain of the United States Air Force on Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. After three years on Lackland Air Force Base, Rabbi Orenstein moved to Lynbrook, New York, where he was Rabbi of Congregation Beth David. After his stay at Temple Beth David he became Rabbi at Temple Israel in Great Neck, New York. For the past 35 years, Rabbi Orenstein has served as the spiritual leader of Congregation Beth El in South Orange, New Jersey. During his distinguished tenure at Beth EI, Rabbi Orenstein has overseen a vibrant and growing Conservative Jewish congregation.

He has written several publications, including a book about Hebrew Literature. Some of his other works include articles published in Conservative Judaism, the New York Times, and Bai'nanu, a working publication for American Conservative Rabbis.

Rabbi Orenstein is the past president of the Maplewood-South Orange Clergy Association, Chaplain of the State Police of New Jersey, and Chaplain of the Maplewood Police and Fire Departments. He is also the past president of the Rabbinical Assembly of New Jersey. I know that he is particularly proud of founding the South Orange-Maplewood Interfaith Holocaust Service, a 27-year tradition.

Rabbi Orenstein is married to Sylvia Mowshowitz Orenstein, a very accomplished attorney in her own right. They are the parents of three very successful children, and are the proud grandparents of five.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to wish Rabbi Jehiel Orenstein a hearty "Mazel Tov!" on giving the opening prayer today on the Senate floor.

Rabbi Orenstein built a strong synagogue during his 35 years at Beth EI, and has been a pillar for the South Orange-Maplewood region. I would also like to thank him for his years of service dedicated not only to his congregants, but our community and the State of New Jersey. May he enjoy a very well-deserved retirement.
