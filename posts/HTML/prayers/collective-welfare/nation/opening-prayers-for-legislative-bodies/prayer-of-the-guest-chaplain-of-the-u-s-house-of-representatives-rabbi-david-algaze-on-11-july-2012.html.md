<blockquote>
<h3>One Minute Speech Given in Recognition of the Guest Chaplain:</h3>
Mr. TURNER of New York. Madam Speaker, fellow Members, I am privileged to have had the honor of inviting Rabbi David Algaze here to lead us in the benediction. Rabbi Algaze serves as the senior rabbi of Ḥavurat Yisrael Synagogue in Forest Hills, Queens, a position he has held since founding the congregation in 1981.

Rabbi Algaze has always held a commitment to academics both as a student and as a teacher. He holds multiple master's degrees and has served as a professor in all levels of academia. He is a former president of the Association of Sephardic Rabbis of America, and is the founder and president of the World Committee for the Land of Israel.

He has always been a strong advocate for the Jewish community in Queens and throughout New York. An ardent supporter of the State of Israel, Rabbi Algaze continues to fight to ensure its safety, security, and well–being. A prime example of these efforts is his work to educate the world about the current situation in Iran and the threat it poses to Israel and the United States.

A scholar, educator, and pillar of religious leadership in our community, he has been a terrific friend to me and has always been there for all those in need.

I thank you, Rabbi Algaze.

God, from Whom all blessings flow, 
bless this assembly 
to steer this great Nation 
to the prominence You bestowed upon her; 
a land where even a humble bicycle messenger 
can soar to serve in this Hall, 
where every man has dignity 
and the capacity to prosper, 
where the ignorant can reach knowledge 
and the persecuted sanctuary. 
Move it from finiteness to infinity, 
from constriction to amplitude, 
from isolation to leadership, 
from cynicism to faith. 
Uphold its pre–eminence among the nations, 
for its message of freedom is beneficial to all men.
