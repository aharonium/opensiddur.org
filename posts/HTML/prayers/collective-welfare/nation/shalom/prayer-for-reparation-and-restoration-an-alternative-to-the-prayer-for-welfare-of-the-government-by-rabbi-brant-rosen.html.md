Give us the strength to resist power

May we abolish all forms of state violence
that we might make way for a world
free of racism and militarization,
a world where no one profits
off the misery of others,
a world where the bills owed those who have been
colonized, enslaved and dispossessed
are finally paid in full.

the world we know is possible,
right here, right now,
in our own day.

guide us toward a future of reparation,
of restoration, of justice,
