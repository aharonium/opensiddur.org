Omnipotent God, merciful Father, 
from under the misty clouds of selfishness, 
prejudice, 
intolerance, 
and hatred 
that are still hovering over a great portion of humanity, 
we beseech Thee, O Lord our God, 
to dissipate the darkness of our earth 
and illuminate our souls 
with a flash of Heavenly light and truth. 
Kindle our hearts 
with a spark of Thy divine love, 
so that we may realize and fulfill 
Thy sacred will to bring about our salvation 
by sympathy, 
goodwill 
and peace 
among all the nations of the earth.

We all have sinned against Thee, O Heavenly Father! 
Those who have power and wealth 
by offending, injuring or oppressing 
the weak and the poor; 
and those oppressed, persecuted and humiliated, 
by abandoning their faith 
and losing their confidence 
in the brotherhood of men 
and providence of God. 
Have mercy upon Thy children 
who have lost Thy ways 
and forgotten Thy commandments; 
who are indifferent to, 
or cause, 
the sufferings of their fellow-men. 
Fulfill Thy promise 
that Thou hast given to Israel through Thy prophets, 
and extend it to all Thy children: 
“And I will give them one heart, 
and I will put a new spirit within you, 
and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh 
and will give them a heart of flesh.”[foot]Ezekiel 11:19 and Ezekiel 36:26–27. See also Jeremiah 32:39–40.[/foot]

Almighty God! 
Thou hast created man in Thine image 
and endowed him with the power 
to rise above his selfish interests. 
In extraordinary moments of great calamities, 
that from time to time befall mankind, 
we find within us the moral courage 
and divine inspiration 
which help us achieve wonderful deeds 
of heroism and self-sacrifice 
for the sake of our fellow-men. 
Awaken, O Lord, those dormant powers within us. 
Help us realize our spiritual and moral capacities 
to the end that we may exercise them 
every day and every hour for the benefit of mankind, 
thus glorifying Thy holy name 
and proclaiming Thy Divine will 
to have peace and love reign on earth. 
<em>Amen</em>.
