Eternal God, 
like all the generations of Israel, 
we turn to You in hope. 
Your spirit pervades the world. 
Your love encompasses the earth. 
We pray for the peace of all lands and peoples. 
And we pray for our brothers and sisters 
in the land of Israel.

In our pilgrimage among the nations, 
our people have always turned in love 
to the land where Israel was born, 
where our prophets taught their imperishable message 
of justice and peace, 
and where our poets sang their deathless songs 
of love for You 
and of Your love for us 
and for all humanity.

Throughout the ages we prayed that Zion be restored; 
it has been for us the land of hope and promise. 
May the promise now come true in all its fullness; 
may a new light shine upon Zion restored.

May we who live in lands of freedom

are one people, 
responsible to one another[foot]Cf. Shevuot 39a.22.[/foot] 
before You.

Willingly and joyfully 
may we share in the redemption of Zion 
and witness that day when once again 
Your Torah will go forth from the house of Israel 
and Your word from the tents of Jacob.

"Land of Hope and Promise" was published in <em>Gates of Prayer: The New Union Prayerbook</em> (CCAR 1975), pp. 240-241. In 1984, it was proved as the "Prayer for Israel" in the <em>Prayerbook for Jewish Personnel in the Armed Forces of the United States</em> (Jewish Welfare Board 1984), p. 436. The work appears to have been adapted from a much earlier <a href="/?p=44035">paraliturgical hashkivenu prayer</a> offered in the <em>Evening Service for the Sabbath from the Union Prayer Book Newly Revised</em> (CCAR 1924) to be said by the Reader between the Shema and the Amidah in a version (â„–5) of the Friday night service, pp. 68-69. --Aharon Varady
