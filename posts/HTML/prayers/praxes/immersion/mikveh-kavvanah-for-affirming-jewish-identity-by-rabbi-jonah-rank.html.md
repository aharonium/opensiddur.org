May these living waters carry me forward
As I have now immersed deeper into the stream of Jewish life.
May the living waters of Torah, symbolized in this mikvah,
Embrace me as I embrace Torah in turn.
As I wade through uncharted waters in my renewed life,
May the Divine guide and comfort me, and may I express gratitude, living a life of blessings.
May the people I am joining support me along this current,
And may I be open to their outpouring of love in hard times and in times of joy.
