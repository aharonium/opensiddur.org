<div class="english" lang="en" style="font-size: 1.2em;">
This meditation is inspired, in part, by pieces written by Rabbi Steven Exler and Zoketsu Norman Fischer. It is also based on the teaching of the Ba'al Shem Tov, the founder of Ḥasidic Judaism, that “a person is a microcosm of the world, and they have inside them Pharaoh, Egypt and so on” (See Toldot Ya'akov Yosef on BeShalaḥ).

And the cry becomes a prayer, ascending to the Infinite and arousing compassion for our plight.

This is our first moment of expression, of beginning to name our reality – at first with a pre-verbal sigh and moan and cry – but then eventually this evolves into words and actions, into telling and living our own story.
&nbsp;
“It was many years later; the king of Egypt died. The children of Israel groaned from the bondage, and they cried out; and their plea for help from the bondage went up to G!d. G!d listened to their moaning, and remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac and with Jacob. G!d saw the children of Israel, and G!d knew.” (Exodus 2:23-25).
