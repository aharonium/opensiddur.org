O God, Creator of all that lives, 
we have planted a tree 
in token of our acknowledgement 
of the duty that rests upon us 
to further your work of creation. 
It is upon you, however, 
and upon your gifts 
of rain 
and sunshine 
and nourishing soil 
that the growth of this tree depends.

And so is it with all our works 
in making this a better world. 
Every good deed we do is but a seed,
taken from the store of your infinite goodness, 
planted by us in this world 
and dependent upon your creative and sustaining power 
to enable it to thrive and bear fruit.

Our mothers and fathers planted a good seed, 
the seed of a self-governing society 
of free and equal citizens. 
Instruct us in your law 
so that we may know 
how to prune the tree which they planted 
of all unwholesome growths, 
and how so to cultivate it 
with loving and patient labor 
that todayâ€™s new shoots 
may ever draw the sap of life 
from the deepest roots of our American past. 
May our nation be indeed a tree of life 
bearing blossoms of beauty 
and fruit of goodness 
for endless ages. 
<em>Amen</em>.

This closing prayer for Arbor Day, "The Significance of the Day," was first published in <em><a href="/?p=34753">The Faith of America: Readings, Songs, and Prayers for the Celebration of American Holidays</a></em> (Jewish Reconstructionist Foundation 1951), p. 86. It is unclear from this publication whether the prayer was written by Mordecai Kaplan, J. Paul Williams, or Eugene Kohn separately or together in collaboration. I have replaced archaisms in this prayer (thee, thy, thou, etc.) as well as egalitarian language where male default language was invoked. --Aharon Varady
