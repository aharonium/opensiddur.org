Yes, there's an oral tradition. (Fitting for something that tastes so delicious!) You've probably heard somebody at a  Seder claim that <em>ḥaroset</em> is the mortar the ancient Israelite slaves had to paste between the bricks and stones of those giant warehouses they were building for Pharaoh.

No. The oral tradition transmitted by <em>ḥaroset</em> is not by word of mouth but taste of mouth. A kiss of mouth. A full-bodied, full-tongued, "kisses sweeter than wine" taste of mouth.

Maybe, without ever asking or answering about <em>ḥaroset</em>, they might mention something that seemed entirely different: that the olden rabbis thought the Song of Songs should be recited during the festival of Passover, but quickly they'd explain that what seems so erotic in the Song was really about God's loving effort to free the Israelites from Pharaoh.

The text of the Song subtly, almost secretly, bears the recipe for <em>ḥaroset</em>, and we might well see the absence of any specific written explanation of <em>ḥaroset</em> as itself a subtle, secret pointer toward the "other" liberation of Pesaḥ –- the erotic, Earth-loving freedom celebrated in the Song of Songs, which we are taught to read on Passover.

So the "recipe" points us toward apples, quinces, raisins, apricots, figs, nuts, wine. Within the framework of the free fruitfulness of the earth, the "recipe" is free-form: no measures, no teaspoons, no amounts.
