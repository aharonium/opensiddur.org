Dear God, Holy One, Beloved,
&nbsp;
This fragile, beautiful world of ours stands at a precipice. 
It always has. Perhaps it always will.
Every moment seems to be a crossroad.
Perhaps that was the plan.
Perhaps there was no plan.
</div></td></tr>

<td style="vertical-align:top;">
<div class="english" lang="en" style="text-align: left;">
But we promise again, Mother of All:
You’ve got us.
And we’ve got a plan.

<td style="vertical-align:top;">
<div class="english" lang="en" style="text-align: left;">
Perhaps, Divine Mystery, that’s You, in us.
Perhaps our yearning for a more created world
is truly Your Spirit stirring in our minds’ eyes, 
inspiring us to be the change we dream to see.
</div></td></tr>

<td style="vertical-align:top;">
<div class="english" lang="en" style="text-align: left;">
Perhaps, after all, 
Yours has never been a plan, 
but rather seeds of sacred vision.
Perhaps You, Dear One, and we, your children,
are learning every day and doing our best
to see more clearly and feel more fiercely.
</div></td></tr>

God, that is a true gift:
to see with Your Eyes 
and to love with Your Love.

<div class="liturgy" lang="he" style="text-align: right;">

</div></td>

<td style="vertical-align:top;">
<div class="english" lang="en" style="text-align: left;">
For these blessings, 
and the gift of more days in which to be of service with You
as partners in Creation,
may we be ever thankful. 
</div></td></tr>

<div class="liturgy" lang="he" style="text-align: right;">

</div></td>

<td style="vertical-align:top;">
<div class="english" lang="en" style="text-align: left;">
We know we are called to repair 
that which remains broken.
And so, we pray:
&nbsp;
May we walk humbly but not too humbly
as we channel Your Spirit, coursing through our bodies 
to bring more justice, more kindness, more hope, 
and more love into the world.
</div></td></tr>

<div class="liturgy" lang="he" style="text-align: right;">

</div></td>

<td style="vertical-align:top;">
<div class="english" lang="en" style="text-align: left;">
May the coming days find us ever ready 
to walk in Your ways by walking with each other
to do with our bodies what we often ask of You:
to see, to discover, to build
a truly beautiful world,
a world of Ḥesed, of Love.
&nbsp;
<em>Amen</em>.
