As some folks may recall, I worked on a "secular" kaddish after my mother died so that I could say kaddish under circumstances where I could gather ten people but not ten Jews. I continued to work on this kaddish and have been sharing it with people in my home community, and people seem to really love it and get a lot out of it. So I thought I would share it with you all now (even though most will probably only see it after Rosh Hashanah), because you may find it useful in two ways:

1) As a kind of prayer for Creation in the spirit of the Rosh Hashanah liturgy that hopes for the time when "all creatures become united in one band" to serve God.

2) As an alternative kaddish to do at any point in the service where people might get benefit from something that they can read in English. As such this is not a replacement for kaddish but it might work as one of several kaddishes that get said in a service.
