It is true, and we believe it…
That You are our redeemer.
I am awed when I recall the miracles,
And the help you gave me.
You kept my spirit alive.
You kept me from stumbling.
In the past,
You helped our people.
We all accepted You,
As our leader,
And vowed to follow Your lead.
With Moshe, Miriam, And all Israel,
We sang to You…
<em>Mi Kamokha ba’elim Y-ah
Mi Kamocha ne’dar bakodesh
Nora’ t’hillot ‘Osseh fele’</em>
And we continue
To celebrate You,
As Redeemer of Israel.

You, Yah,
Who saved our ancestors,

To us also.

redeemer of Yisrael.]

Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, z”l, included his translation of Emet v'Emunah, the first blessing following the recitation of the Shema in the evening in his <em><a href="http://opensiddur.org/?p=177">Siddur Tehillat Hashem Yidaber Pi</a></em> (2009). To the best of my ability, I have set his English translation side-by-side with the Hebrew phrases comprising the prayer. –Aharon N. Varady
