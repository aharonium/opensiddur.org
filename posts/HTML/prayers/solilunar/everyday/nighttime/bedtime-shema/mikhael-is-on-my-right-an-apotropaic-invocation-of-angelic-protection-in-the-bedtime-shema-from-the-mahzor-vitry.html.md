This "angels on all sides" formula for protection in the Bedtime Shema can be found in §77 of Abraham Berliner's 1893 edition of the Maḥzor Vitry (transcribing <a href="http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/FullDisplay.aspx?ref=Add_MS_27200">British Library MS. 2700 f.23r</a>). The formula also appears in one of the oldest manuscripts of Maḥzor Vitry, <a href="https://digitalcollections.jtsa.edu/islandora/object/jts%3A98638#page/65/mode/2up">JTSA MS. 8092 f.28v</a>, held in the collection of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. (Note that the manuscripts differ in the placement of the formula within the macroform of the Bedtime Shema.)

This invocation is discussed briefly within the context of other liturgical and theurgical works containing an "angels on all sides" formula in “‘Gabriel is on their Right’: Angelic Protection in Jewish Magic and Babylonian Lore” by Dan Levene, Dalia Marx, and Siam Bharyo in <em>Studia Mesopotamica</em> (Band 1: 2014) pp.185-198. The authors include a chart listing the various numinous entities associated with each direction in a number of comparative bowls, amulets, and other texts.

It occurred to me while working on this text, that the "angels on all sides" formula describes the divine chariot, with either a divine steed (Susiel) or illumination (Uriel) in front, a support for the rider that is either comfortable (Menuḥa) or healing (Refael) behind, and complemented by strong powers on either side suggesting incredible force (Gavriel/Harba'el) and striking damage (Mikhael). Shekhinat-El, above, may be described by this image as the wreath crown (keter) or the divine favor granted to the chariot rider. If this depiction is correct, then what we have here is something like the chariot of Helios projected onto the person requiring divine protection. The innovation of the angels Sanoi, Sansanoi, and Semanglof in this formula makes sense to me only when their respective names' scriptural association with ingredients for pleasant aromas is considered (Exodus 30:34 and Song of Songs 7:9). As forces associated with sacred ingredients for incense, these angels may be the numinous embodiment of a heavenly miasma acting to ward off worldly evils associated with bad odors. Indeed, their role as guarantors to a promise Lilith made to Adam and Ḥavah not to harm their progeny (in a tale found in the <em>Alphabet of Ben Sira</em>) is framed within the fragrant setting of the primæval Garden. Before crossing the threshold between wakeful awareness to sleep and dream, such a prayer invokes all the different powers one needs for protecting one at their most vulnerable for a healing, undisturbed rest. --Aharon Varady
