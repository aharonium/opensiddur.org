The earliest artifacts recording Jewish liturgy (or for that matter any Hebrew formulation found in the Torah) are two small silver amulets, discovered in 1979 by Israeli archaeologist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Barkay">Gabriel Barkay</a>. He discovered the amulets in a burial chamber while excavating in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketef_Hinnom">Ketef Hinnom</a>, a section of the Hinnom Valley south of Jerusalem's Old City.

The inscriptions on these amulets conclude with parts of the <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priestly_blessing">Birkat Kohanim</a></em> (Priestly Blessing), the three-part blessing in which the Kohanim are instructed to bless the people of Israel in Numbers 6:22-27. The script in the amulets dates them approximately to the reign of King Yoshiyahu (late 7th or early 6th century BCE) predating the <a href="https://opensiddur.org/2011/01/adventures-in-ancient-jewish-liturgy-the-ten-commandments-and-the-shma-in-the-nash-papyrus/">Nash papyrus</a>, and the earliest of the Dead Sea Scrolls by four centuries.

The <em>Birkat Kohanim</em> may have been a well-known liturgical formula in Ancient Israelite religion, and so was recorded both in amulets and in the Torah. Here is the <em>Birkat Kohanim</em> according to the Masoretic text of Book of Numbers 6:22-27:

The wording of the blessings in the amulets is not exactly the wording as found in the Masoretic text of the Torah. Note that the formulation <em>veyichunekha</em> (be gracious towards you) is not present in either of the scrolls below. The formula of the <em>Birkat Kohanim</em> begins on the 5th line:[foot]Gabriel Barkay, “The Priestly Benediction on the Ketef Hinnom Plaques,” Cathedra 52 (1989), p. 58[/foot]
<blockquote>[Top line(s) broken: For PN xxxx]

The formula of the <em>Birkat Kohanim</em> begins on the 14th line of the first amulet. All of Numbers 6:25-26 may have appeared on KH1 after line 18 where the scroll has disintegrated. [foot]Gabriel Barkay, “The Priestly Benediction on the Ketef Hinnom Plaques,” Cathedra 52 (1989), p. 52[/foot]
