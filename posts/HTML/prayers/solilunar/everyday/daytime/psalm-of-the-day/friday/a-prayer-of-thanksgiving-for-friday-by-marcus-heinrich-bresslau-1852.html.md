Hallelujah! With pious sentiments my soul lifts itself up unto Thee O Father, and tunes forth sacred psalms. On the sixth day of the Creation, after Thou didst bless the earth with everything in abundance, and made it a paradise, then resounded the voice of Thy impenetrable wisdom: now we will make a being in our own image! and thus was man made, who, although the last of the creation, became the chief of all that was created before him by the sublime gifts of the mind with which Thou hast endowed him. The rich fulness of higher powers, which he developes in a thousandfold exercises, constitutes him the ruler, the King of the earth. But not for this short life, O Eternal, hast Thou created us; not for the sake of enjoying the transient goods of this world, didst Thou breathe a soul into man; but for the life yonder, for life eternal, for which we are to prepare ourselves here beneath. Here the seeds of good are to be sown, but yonder they shall be reaped.

O, may this belief in its full clearness ever penetrate my spirit; may the conviction that all men, though separated in their earthly relations, are united by one holy vocation never vanish from my memory; may the sublime idea, that all mankind are to constitute one community of God, whilst we are all His children, and He is father of all men—may this elevating thought ever penetrate me and every other human being, in order that everyone by everyone be esteemed as a member of Thy realm. Be it the highest delight of every one to delight others; to obey the voice of justice, in order that we all, even all, may attain that sublime aim which Thy great kindness and merciful compassion has appointed for all men; and that there may be soon fulfilled the words of our holy prophet: “<span class="hebrew" lang="he">וְהָיָה יְהוָה לְמֶלֶךְ עַל־כָּל־הָאָרֶץ בַּיּוֹם הַהוּא יִהְיֶה יְהוָה אֶחָד וּשְׁמוֹ אֶחָד</span>” “That the Lord shall be King over all the earth. In that day the Lord shall be one and his name one.”[foot]Zechariah 14:9.[/foot] <em>Amen</em>.
