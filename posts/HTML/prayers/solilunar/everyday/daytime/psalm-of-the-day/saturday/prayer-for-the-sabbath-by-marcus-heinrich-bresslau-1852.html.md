All merciful God! Animated by sacred thoughts, inspired with holy feelings, freed from all care for transient goods, I appear before Thee, Eternal, to thank Thee, to praise Thee, and to bless Thee, for the manifold benefits which Thou hast conferred upon me, even in the week just elapsed, and for the sublime delight which I enjoy in the conscientiousness not to have fallen under the dominion of vain cravings. Lend me further strength, O Omnipotent, to resist the allurements of unlawful enjoyment, ever to direct my eyes with fervent longing to the great purpose of humanity, to conquer my foibles, and to ennoble my desires. Fortify me, O Father, on this holy Sabbath, which Thou hast given us for the sanctification of our minds, and for the blissful occupation of our spirit through faith in Thee, the witness and judge of our deeds; strengthen me to perseverance in the good, and to the fulfilment of my holy resolutions; strengthen me on this day of rest, in the arduous struggle for the highest and imperishable gems, which I as a daughter, (wife, mother,) friend, citizen of the world, and Israelite, am to possess. O, Omniscient, elevate Thou my power <em>to know myself</em>; rejoice me in Thy salvation, preserve me in the acknowledgment of Thy truth and justice, and be gracious unto me, Thy handmaiden, now and evermore. <em>Amen</em>.
