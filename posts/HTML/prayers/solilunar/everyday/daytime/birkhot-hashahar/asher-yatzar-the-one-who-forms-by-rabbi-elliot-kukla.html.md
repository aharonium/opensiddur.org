You created in the human body 
openings upon openings 
and cavities upon cavities. 
It is clear and well-known 
that if just one of these unique valves 
within the complexity of each body 
was blocked or ruptured, 
it would be impossible to survive. 
May the day come when it is also obvious and evident 
that if just one unique body 
within the complexity of Your world 
is blocked or ruptured, 
if just one of us 
is not allowed to make our distinctive beauty 
manifest in the world, 
then it is impossible for all of Your creation 
to thrive and rise each day joyfully before You.

Blessed are You, 
Source of all life and form, 
who implanted within us the ability 
to shape and reshape ourselves—
molding, 
changing, 
transitioning, 
and adorning our bodies—
so that the fullness of our many genders,
 the abundance of our desires, 
 and the diversity of our souls can be revealed.

"Asher Yatzar (The One Who Forms): a prayer of gratitude for our bodies as transgender, nonbinary, intersex people, and everybody else" was written by Rabbi Elliot Kukla and adapted from the blessing known by its incipit "Asher Yatsar" or "the bathroom blessing" traditionally recited after excretion of waste. The blessing is also recited as part of the birkhot hashaḥar complex of blessings recited upon waking up and becoming active. Rabbi Kukla's blessing was first published in <em>Where Healing Resides</em> (CCAR 2013), p. 32.
