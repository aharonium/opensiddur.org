Merciful Father in Heaven! 
my never-failing and sincere endeavour, 
is to execute Thy holy commandments 
as the aim of my existence. 
Even those laws, Lord! 
which my feeble understanding 
cannot fathom — 
whose meaning and intent 
I cannot comprehend, 
resignedly and willingly 
I obey, 
because Thou, all-wise King! 
hast ordered them.

'Tis thus, I herewith, 
with a devout spirit, 
perform the precept Thou hast enjoined upon us, 
to dedicate at all times a portion of the dough 
as a heave-offering unto Thee; 
and with my humble obedience, 
I unite my thanks, O Lord! 
that Thou hast formed me worthy 
of fulfilling this consecration.

Enlighten my eyes 
to behold the wonders of Thy holy law; 
and let this bread, 
which I herewith prepare 
for the festival of the Sabbath-day, 
admonish me to be devout 
and grateful for Thy goodness. 
Let it be to me, 
as a symbol of that Heavenly manna, 
wherewith Thou didst feed my ancestors 
in the wilderness; 
and of which Thou didst send on the sixth day, 
a double portion for their nourishment, 
that they might consecrate to Thee, 
the sacred day of rest.

We have transcribed her translation as it was published in <em><a href="/?p=41448">Devotional Exercises for the Use of Jewish Women on Public and Domestic Occasions</a></em> (1852), pp. 51-52.
