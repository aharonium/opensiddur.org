This is pre-Shabbos reflection that can be done in a shower or bath. Shabbat is a time when I am less focused on my selfish desires and instead my thoughts drift to my place in the larger community and world. I find myself doing some version of this before Shabbos most weeks and am welcome for the time to reflect on truly what it is to cease from lay work and consider the work that needs to be done to make the world a better place.

<blockquote>Disturb us, Adonai, ruffle us from our complacency; Make us dissatisfied. Dissatisfied with the pace of ignorance, the quietude which arises from a shunning of the horror, the defeat, the bitterness and the poverty, physical and spiritual, of humans...Disturb us, O god, and vex us; let not your Shabbat be a day of torpor and slumber; let it a time to be stirred and spurred to action. <em>Baruch atah, Adonai, m'kadeish HaShabat</em>.[foot]<em>Mishkan Tefilah</em>, pg. 173[/foot]</blockquote>
