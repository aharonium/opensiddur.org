<span class="acrostic"> </span>The God who is hidden––to all of our reason is naught.
Wisdom concealed, wisdom kept secret, from all of our deepest thought.
Cause of all causes, surpassing all causes, hidden crown of all.
A <em>keter</em> we give you, a crown we now offer, to you YHVH (Adonai).[foot]Why do we begin with the most distant sephira, Keter (Crown)? Keter is beyond all attempts to grasp it with the mind. It appears to be something like a canopy. We can only receive from it. Here is a quote from Tomer Devorah (The Palm Tree of Deborah) by Moses Cordovero, whose disciple (Avraham Maimin) was the author of El Mistater: “The quality of humility includes all qualities, for it belongs to Keter, which is the highest attribute. It is ashamed to gaze at its Source, but the Cause of its emanation looks continually into it to give goodness to it.” So we begin our exploration of the tree of life with an act of pure receptivity.[/foot]

Imprinting your wisdom, it was sublime.
It came forth from nothing, and then it was hid. (2x)
The beginning of wisdom, <em>resheet ḥokhmah</em>, is <em>yir’at</em> Adonai.[foot]The second sephirah—Chochmah—is wisdom, but it is a wisdom which offers itself to us only in flashes. Most of the time it hides from us. So once again we can receive from it only with awe and humility. Chochmah itself receives from Keter, but turns arounds and bestows its gifts on those below it. Tomer Devorah refers to it as “the father of all created things”.[/foot]

The devotee swims in the waters of Binah, as in a river. Binah is on the left or dark side of the Tree of Life, so its function is to absorb the dark forces and bring them to the light. According to Tomer Devorah: “The function of Binah is to sweeten all judgments and to neutralize their bitterness. The root of every Supernal bitterness is sweet. The Left Side draws its sustenance from above. All its branches are destined to become sweet and they will be perfect once again. Man roots himself in the secret of evil and renders it sweet and brings it into the good.”[/foot]

God of Avraham, remember us now. 
Remember us your servants: we’re all here to serve you.
Ḥesed of Adonai, hear now our praises, Adonai.[foot]The fourth sephirah, Chesed or lovingkindness, is perhaps the easiest to receive from but at the same time the most difficult to emulate. To act in accordance with Chesed one must (in the words of Tomer Devorah), “concentrate on the good side of a quality and conceal its judgment.”. Our prayers go to the sephirah of Tipheret, which in turns receives from both Chesed and Gevurah. So Tomer Devorah states: “One should intend, with the deeds he performs, to bind Tipheret constantly to Chesed and to bring it forth from Binah in the direction of Chesed.”[/foot]

O source of strength, you give us strength, unceasing strength, Adonai.[foot]Gevurah is associated with power as well as with the evil inclination. It appears on the left or dark side of the Tree of Life, directly below Binah. According to El Mistater, it draws its energy from eyn temurah: the “place of exchange”. As such it is close to the place where good and evil turn into their opposites. The devotee’s task is to “bestir his evil inclination in the direction of the sweet Gevurot”, as it says in Tomer Devorah. One channels one’s vital energies in the direction of Binah by striving to do the divine will, whereby the dark forces are sweetened. This sephirah is called Pachad Yitzchak (“the Fear of Isaac”) because Isaac—having been nearly offered up on the divine altar but became instead one of the fathers of the chosen people—understood the transformative potential of Gevurah.[/foot]

<em>Tiferet</em> Yisrael: you never cease to hear our prayers.
The living grace of Israel is hearing all our prayers:
No one but you hears the prayers of the poor, Yah. (2x)
You are the one who listens to prayers, Adonai.[foot]Tipheret is beauty, but it a kind of beauty that is not easy to acquire because it requires a balance between Gevurah and Chesed. As such it is associated with justice. When the dark forces of judgment become so heavy that they become destructive, Tipheret attempts to push the energy to the right, towards the sepherah of Chesed. Thus according to Tomer Devorah: “There are angels in a certain celestial palace whose function it is to receive the kindness done by man, and when the divine quality of Tipheret pleads against Israel these angels immediately bring that kindness to the notice of the Holy One, Blessed is He, Who has mercy upon Israel, for He delighteth in mercy.” Tipheret is invoked by studying Torah. It is also God in its most personal form.[/foot]

El Mistater teaches that the true tzaddik is hidden inside of the seven lower sephirot. Since the goal of creation is in the sephirah of malchut, the Tomer Devorah says: “The Bow of the Upper World is outstretched only for the purpose of shooting arrows into the sephirah of Malchut.”[/foot]

Crown of beauty and of splendor all are in your hands, Adonai.[foot]The culmination of the divine act of creation is the sephirah of Malchut. The most difficult task is to unite Malchut with Tipheret. According to Tomer Devorah: “The Shekinah is love-sick for the Union of Tipheret with Malchut.” “One should bind Her (Malchut) between Netsach and Hod. It is necessary to visit Her soul and to entreat Her to take food and drink from the Supernal Flow from which she abstains because Her soul is sick for the misery of Israel, just as it is with the sick of the material world. And Tipheret is sick, for He moves from His place in the world to come to wander after Her in this world.” It further states: “Do all of your actions for the sake of Heaven and without any trace of evil inclination. Tephillin and Tzitzith are also powerful in shielding Her (Malchut) that the Outside Ones have no dominion over Her and he should be accustomed to wear them. Thirdly, to make union with Tipheret during the time of reading the Shema and by setting aside periods for the study of the Torah. And when he sets aside a period for any purpose he should intend that this is the time of the Shekinah, the King's Daughter.”[/foot]

This not only leads to self-realization, but also serves to bring the entire community together, because each member of a congregation becomes a focal point for one of the sepherot, which explains the principle of the minyan. As Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi interprets El Mistater: “If one (of the ten sepherot) be cut off, no light wil be seen.”[/foot]

From the liner notes for the album <em>Life of the Worlds – Journeys in Jewish Sacred Music</em> by Chazan Richard Kaplan, which contains Richard’s recording of "El Mistater" (2003):

<blockquote>[‘El Mistater’ is] a major hasidic composition, brought to North America by Rabbi Zalman Schachter Shalomi in 1939, barely saving it (and thank G-d, himself) from the Holocaust. This poem on the Ten Sefirot (Divine Emanations) was written in Tsefat around 1550 by Rabbi Avraham Maimin, a student of Rabbi Moshe Cordovero (1522-1570), the teacher and master to the great Kabbalist Rabbi Isaac Luria (1534-1572), known as ha'ARI (“The Lion"), Rabbi Maimin's name appears acrostically at the beginning of stanzas.

This musical version comes from the Husyatiner hasidim (devout ones), Poland. Each of the eleven sections of the song (the last section is a paean to the Ten Sefirot) has its own melody, reflecting the feeling of its corresponding Sefirah (Emanation), Reb Zalman told me that it was composed by a Husyatiner cantor who presented it to the Husyatiner Rebbe. … This prayer is most often found as part of the Sabbath Third Meal celebration, which in hasidic circles is seen as a most favorable time for mystical profundities to be experienced. Other communities chant it every day.</blockquote>

Because the poem was written by a disciple of Moshe Cordovero, I looked to the latter’s book Tomer Devorah (The Palm Tree of Deborah) for inspiration. This work describes the qualities of each of the Sefirot to show how we can emulate it to develop our own character. I wrote a commentary on ‘El Mistater’ by taking quotes from this work.

Then, because the musical version comes from the Husyatiner hasidim, I put together some notes about these Rebbes and their lineage (descended from the Ruzhin dynasty).
I treat the second Hisyatiner Rebbe, Yisroel Friedman (1858-1949), a grandson of the Ruzhiner)—as the inspiration for this music, and include his picture on my Etz Chaim diagram.

As always, when I want to make a Hebrew text something of my own, I create a singable English version.  The more I sing this music, the more I feel the energy of each sefirah that its particular melody invokes. Singing it in both Hebrew and in English deepens my meditation on the sefirah’s essence.  I have made recordings in both languages of all eleven melodies (ten + a final verse which unites the ten sefirot into one).
