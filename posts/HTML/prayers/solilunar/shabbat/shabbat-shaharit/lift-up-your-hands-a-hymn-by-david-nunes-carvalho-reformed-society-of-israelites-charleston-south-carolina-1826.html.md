"Lift Up Your Hands" appears as Hymn 15 in <em><a href="/?p=39485">The Sabbath service and miscellaneous prayers, adopted by the Reformed society of Israelites, founded in Charleston, S.C., November 21, 1825</a></em> (1830, Bloch: 1916), p. 62. The hymn was written for the second anniversary celebration of the Reformed Society of Israelites (which would have been in 1826). Gary Zola writes that the prayer was written by David Carvalho for the Society as indicated in Abraham Mo√Øse's annotated copy of the 1830 prayerbook.[foot]Find, "The First Reform Prayerbook in America" (p. 116 ft. 32) in <em>Platforms and prayer books: theological and liturgical perspectives on Reform Judaism</em> (2002)[/foot] I have replaced the vocalized Tetragramaton in the fourth line of the first stanza with 'YHVH.' I have preserved the wording as handwritten in the endpapers of the <em>Constitution of the Reformed Society of Israelites, 1825</em>. --Aharon Varady
