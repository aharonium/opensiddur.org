"Prayer Song" from <em>David Dances, a play</a></em> (1973/1975) by Stephen Hanan Kaplan is included in Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi's <a href="http://opensiddur.org/?p=29177">Sabbath Supplement</a> to his <em><a href="http://opensiddur.org/?p=177">Siddur Tehillat Hashem Yidaber Pi ~ As I Can Say It (for Praying in the Vernacular)</a></em> (2009). The line “O Lord, O Lord, come into my heart, build there your shrine, and never depart” is quoted in Reb Zalman's <em>Davening: A Guide to Meaningful Jewish Prayer</em> (Jewish Lights, 2012), chapter "Intention: Davvening with Kavvanah" p. 23.

<blockquote>
Knowing that everything I think and feel is revealed and known to God is, in itself, an important form of divine service, of avodat ha-Shem. I want no barrier separating what I feel in my heart from what I’m praying and asking for. I want to make myself transparent of heart, transparent of mind, transparent of body—to say, “O Lord, O Lord, come into my heart, build there your shrine, and never depart.” I wish to constantly remember that everything I do is witnessed by that Infinite Witness. I want to invite that witness in and not shut it out. I want my awareness to bring me to the life described in Proverbs 3:6, “Be-khol derakhekha da’eihu, Know God in all your ways.”
</blockquote>
