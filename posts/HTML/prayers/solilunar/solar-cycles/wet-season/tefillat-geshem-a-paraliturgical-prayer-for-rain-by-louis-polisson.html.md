Our Beloved Earth and the Earth of our Ancestors, 
&nbsp;
<strong>Remember</strong> 
The parents drawn to your riverbanks, 
overflowing with water. 
&nbsp;
One was blessed with thirst quenched 
like a tree planted by streams of water. 
&nbsp;
Your downpour relieved another 
from the fiery heat with water. 
&nbsp;
They and you sought each otherâ€™s well-being, 
as they sowed seeds by your water.

<strong>Recall</strong> 
The once-barren woman 
who had mercy on those who longed 
for just a sip of water. 
&nbsp;
She lived with integrity 
on land nourished by water. 
&nbsp;
She led countless women 
to stand with her in solidarity - 
Taking shade under trees 
rooted in soil and water. 
&nbsp;
Thanks to her careful planting and stewardship, 
She suckled thousands with the natural milk 
that we call water.

<strong>Commemorate</strong> 
The prophetesses and prophets 
who invited us to partner with the water; 
&nbsp;
Who shepherded us and lifted us up, 
to free ourselves through falls of water; 
&nbsp;
Who taught us rituals 
to mark the ebbs and flows of seasons and water; 
&nbsp;
The ones who taught us how to build fires 
and watch the clouds that hydrated us with water.

<strong>Return</strong> 
To your sacred nature, 
the spirit within your body 
of stardust and water. 
&nbsp;
Renew yourself with days of feasting 
and become pure with one day 
of abstaining from water. 
&nbsp;
Prepare by witnessing the cleansing, 
life-giving power of water. 
&nbsp;
Know before whom you stand 
and remember that we can repair the world, 
if we learn to accept and to change like water.

Rabbi Louis Polisson's "Prayer for Rain - An Interpretive Translation and New Stanza of Tefillat Geshem (The Prayer for Rain) Recited on Shemini Atseret," was inspired by the Alternative Ashkenazic Prayer for Rain with Matriarchs in Siddur Lev Shalem. It was written for Rabbi Katy Allen's <em>Earth Etudes</em> for Elul 5779.
