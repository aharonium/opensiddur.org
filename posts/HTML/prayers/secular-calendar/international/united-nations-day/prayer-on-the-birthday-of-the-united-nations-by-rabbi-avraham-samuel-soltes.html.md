Father of all Men:
Since time immemorial
Thy children
have sought
to find Thee
in the realm of nature
and in the varied experiences of their
lives:
In the roar of thunder
have they heard Thy stirring voice;
in the golden glory of the sun
have they seen Thy radiance.
Where the mountains tower
above the plain,
they have built Thee
their altars,
and in the forest's cooling shade
have they heard
Thy still, small voice.

But
deepest of all
has been
the resonance of Thy spirit
that has echoed to man
from the heart of his fellow.
He has longed
through the ages
for the day
When the swords of battle
Would be beaten
into ploughs of peace,
when the spears of conquest
would be bent
into hooks of harvest.

the soft-skinned babe
of brotherhood.

shall sit under his vine and fig tree,
beside his own house and garden,
and none shall make him afraid.

“Birthday of the United Nations” was first published in Rabbi Avraham Soltes’ collection of prayers, תפלה <em>Invocation: Sheaf of Prayers</em> (Bloch 1959). No date was given for its composition but sometime between 1948 and 1958 is certain. In 1948, the United Nations General Assembly declared 24 October, the anniversary of the Charter of the United Nations, as which "shall be devoted to making known to the people of the world the aims and achievements of the United Nations and to gaining their support for" its work.[foot]United Nations General Assembly Session 2 Resolution 168. United Nations Day A/RES/168(II) 31 October 1947.[/foot]
