All kind and merciful Father,
in whose sight
a thousand years
a re but as a day,
as we stand assembled
here
in this peaceful city
on this beautiful day,
we are deeply moved
by memories,
and spurred
by hopes.

Yet

move our hearts

O Heavenly Father,
that
not by tears
nor by lamentation
can we offer fitting tribute
to these saviours of our Republic.
'Twas not for weeping
nor for monuments,
for parades
nor for speeches
that they gave their lives.

Our sons
died,
that we

that we might live
as friends and neighbors,
bound together
by invisible cords of democracy
and brotherhood.
They died

to bring closer
the day
of which Scripture has spoken:
"Proclaim liberty throughout the land
unto all the inhabitants thereof. . ."

Our sorrow is soothed,
O God,

But, can we be at peace
as long as
the hopes
for which they offered
their immeasurable devotion
are endangered or unfulfilled?

Help us,
O Father,
to understand
that there are no easy short-cuts to
democracy;
that the freedoms which Thy
children won
at such supreme cost,
short days ago,
cannot be preserved for us
today
by self-anointed inquisitors,
who would destroy the very liberties
for which they gave their lives,
in the name of
speedily saving the Republic.
For he who strangles liberty,
be it even
with a flag,
is as guilty of murdering her
as though
he wielded a hammer and sickle.

the dream of centuries

Aid us to see,
O Master of the Universe,
that this democracy
with which we have been endowed
by the blood
and the wisdom of generations
is never perfect;
that its essence is
"unfinished business",
which one generation
passes on to another
like the torch at Marathon.

Help us
to do our part,
in this
our blessed community,
to bring its democracy
closer
to the heavenly ideal,
that we may be truly
proud
of the banners we wave
that we may march
in our patriotic rhythms
this day
with heads held high,
knowing
that as we parade
the spirit of our departed heroes
marches beside us,
genuinely proud of our achievements
and satisfied
that their supreme sacrifice
was not made in vain.
<em>Amen</em>.
