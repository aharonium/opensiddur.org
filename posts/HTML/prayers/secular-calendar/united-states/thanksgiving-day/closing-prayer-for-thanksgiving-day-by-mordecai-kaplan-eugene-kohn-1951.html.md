O you who are our Creator

Let us not, in the pride of possession,

Teach us that the joy of creation 
far surpasses that of acquisition, 
that there is more security in mutual helpfulness 
than in selfish hoarding, 
that to earn the love and gratitude of our fellow men 
affords a deeper satisfaction than to force their fear, servility, and envy.

We thank you, O God, 
for all your gifts, 
but above all we thank you 
for the gift of your spirit,

for our blessing. 
<em>Amen</em>.

This closing prayer for Thanksgiving Day was first published in <em><a href="/?p=34753">The Faith of America: Readings, Songs, and Prayers for the Celebration of American Holidays</a></em> (Jewish Reconstructionist Foundation 1951), p. 327-328 -- following at the end of a number of readings selected by Mordecai Kaplan, Eugene Kohn, and J. Paul Williams for the day. It is unclear from this publication whether the prayer was written by Mordecai Kaplan, J. Paul Williams, or Eugene Kohn separately or together in collaboration. I have edited this prayer to replace archaisms (thee, thou, etc.). -- Aharon Varady
