Here we are, ready and prepared 
to acknowledge the sovereignty of the land as we are commanded 
for the sake of unification.[foot]The phrase "for the sake of unification" comes from Kabbalistic formulation of intention originated by Rabbi Isaac Luria in the 16th century. The traditional formulation of "I am ready and prepared" is for intention that precedes action, and so is appropriate here, since a land acknowledgment is intended to spur us to concrete action.[/foot]

This indigenous land acknowledgement was compiled by Dr. Aurora Mendelsohn for her Mendelsohn/Kalikow Family Haggadah (2020) and was adapted from a Land Acknowledgment offered at the Kohenet service held at the Parliament of World Religions, Toronto, November 2018. It reads, "Jews of many backgrounds have experienced a sense of geographical and cultural displacement over the years. We acknowledge our history of displacement, and as importantly, we acknowledge the ways in which we as non-indigenous peoples and settlers have benefited from colonialism, former and ongoing which has hurt and oppressed First Nations peoples. We ask for your forgiveness at this time." Territories and treaties obtained from the interactive map at <a href="https://native-land.ca">https://native-land.ca</a>, which covers Indigenous lands globally.
