On the fourth of July, in the year 1776, a new nation was born, the United States of America, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. The faith and vision of the Founding Fathers are expressed in a solemn Declaration of Independence. That Declaration set forth the principles which moved them to establish the former British colonies as an independent union of states. It is well that on the anniversary of this event we be reminded of the spiritual foundations of our Republic, and that we renew from year to year our allegiance to them. Let us then rise and listen to the words of that epoch-making Declaration:

“We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed; that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. . . .

This service for Independence Day appears on pages 545-547 of <em><a href="https://opensiddur.org/compilations/shabbat-siddur/sabbath-prayer-book-by-mordecai-kaplan-1945/">The Sabbath Prayer Book</a></em> (Jewish Reconstructionist Foundation, 1945). In Rabbi Kaplan's prayer, "That America Fulfil the Promise of Its Founding," I have replaced "thee, thy, and thou" archaisms. I have also tagged this prayer with the "problematic prayer" flag due to a statement concerning the use of natural resources "for the highest good of all men." I enjoin those adopting this prayer to adapt this statement to one which fully embraces our human role in preserving local, regional, and global ecologies for the mutual benefit of all species, as our continued existence on earth is interdependent and interconnected. --Aharon N. Varady
