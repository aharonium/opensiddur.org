Floating softly down from cloudland, 
Veiling o’er the azure blue, 
Robing all the earth in shadows, 
Hiding everything from view. 
In the twilight, in the gloaming, 
Like the spirits of the night, 
Bringing darkness with their brightness, 
Fell the flakes of gleaming white.

<div class="english" lang="en" style="text-align: left;">
One pale, vestal star had glittered 
Faintly through the twilight grey, 
But its silv’ry beams had vanished 
With the shrouded death of day; 
Said my heart: “The days are dreary 
And the earth is filled with woe; 
Every friend has vanished—vanished, 
Like a landscape in the snow.”

<td style="vertical-align:top;">
<div class="english" lang="en" style="text-align: left;">
And my gaze, by teardrops blinded, 
Turned from winter’s cold and gloom, 
Met a brighter, fairer picture 
As the firelight lit the room; 
While beside me, warm and glowing, 
Sweet as by-gone summer hours, 
Stood a gift from friendship’s fingers— 
Softly tinted, fragrant flowers.

<td style="vertical-align:top;">
<div class="english" lang="en" style="text-align: left;">
Smilax sprays, some pale, sweet roses, 
Feathery ferns and pinks as white 
As the spotless fragments drifted 
On the sleeping face of Night; 
Vaguely chimed their silv’ry voices; 
There’s no friendship but the true, 
And rememb’rance, Friendship’s echo, 
Seeks this guise to speak to you.

<div class="liturgy" lang="he" style="text-align: right;">

</div></td>

<td style="vertical-align:top;">
<div class="english" lang="en" style="text-align: left;">
And to say: “Like flowers of summer 
Blooming near us unawares, 
Thus does joy bloom on our pathway, 
E’en when life seems dark with cares; 
Friendship true can never perish, 
Though our faith may pass away, 
As a fragrance haunts the senses 
Though the roses may decay. 
</div></td></tr>


<tr><td style="vertical-align:top;">
<div class="liturgy" lang="he" style="text-align: right;">

</div></td>

<td style="vertical-align:top;">
<div class="english" lang="en" style="text-align: left;">
Friendship is not like a snowflake, 
But as constant and as true 
As its want that springs within us— 
As the violet’s eyes are blue; 
Shame it not by doubts and questions— 
If it lives, it lives for aye.” 
Softly, strangely had the voices 
Melted with the dying day. 
</div></td></tr>

<div class="liturgy" lang="he" style="text-align: right;">

</div></td>

<td style="vertical-align:top;">
<div class="english" lang="en" style="text-align: left;">
Long I sat there in the firelight 
As the room it dimly lit, 
Till upon the air before me 
Three young faces seemed to flit— 
May their friendship blossom for me 
As their flowers, fresh and bright, 
F’en when age has turned our tresses 
Silv’ry as the snows tonight. 
</div></td></tr>
