may be cast,
they may be fortified
in their spiritual fibre
to resist
the corroding barnacles of callousness
that would impair
the worthiness of their endeavors.

the healing hands
of Thy ministering angels.

"Nurse's Commencement" at Beth Israel Hospital was first published in Rabbi Avraham Soltes’ collection of prayers, תפלה <em>Invocation: Sheaf of Prayers</em> (Bloch 1959) and dated to September 19, 1951. We are not entirely certain whether this prayer was written for a Nurse's Commencement ceremony at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Sinai_Beth_Israel">Beth Israel Hospital</a> in lower Manhattan, next to Stuyvesant Town, which included a School of Nursing, or for a ceremony at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newark_Beth_Israel_Medical_Center">Beth Israel Hospital</a> in Newark, New Jersey. In 1949, Rabbi Soltes, left his position as assistant rabbi at Congregation Rodeph Sholom in Manhattan to serve as rabbi at Temple Sharey Tefilo in East Orange, New Jersey (which is close to Newark).

Beth Israel Hospital was incorporated on May 28, 1890 by a group of 40 Orthodox Jews on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, each of whom paid 25 cents to set up a hospital dedicated to serving immigrant Jews living in the tenement slums of the Lower East Side of Manhattan. At the time, most of New York's hospitals would not treat patients who had been in the city less than a year. It initially opened a dispensary at 206 Broadway in 1891, and moved to Jefferson and Cherry Streets in 1895. On March 12, 1929, it moved to First Avenue and 16th Street, facing Stuyvesant Square, and the old building was converted into an old age home, the Home of Old Israel. It purchased its neighbor Manhattan General Hospital in 1964 and was renamed Beth Israel Medical Center on March 10, 1965.

Newark Beth Israel Medical Center, previously Newark Beth Israel Hospital, is the largest hospital in Newark, New Jersey. It was run under auspices of the Newark Jewish Community and its suburban successors from its inception in 1900-1901 until its purchase by Barnabas Health in 1996.
