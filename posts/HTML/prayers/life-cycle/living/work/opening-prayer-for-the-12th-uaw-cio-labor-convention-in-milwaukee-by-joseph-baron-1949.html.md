Help us, O Father, 
to bear in mind constantly 
how much we owe to the labors of our fellow men. 
Day by day others toil that we may be satisfied; 
they brave the terrors of the unknown 
for the truth that sheds light on our way. 
Numberless gifts have been laid in our cradles 
as our birthright by men and women 
in every corner of the globe.

Help us then, O God, 
to realize that labor is man’s very life, 
that nothing comes into the world ready made, 
and that, therefore, 
none of us in the pride of possession 
forget the true nature and source of wealth 
or the responsibilities of power.

Give us the strength 
to pierce through the clouds of disagreement 
that we may see our common interests 
and soar above the distinctions of color, creed and culture: 
that we may see our common destiny 
to keep aglow the sacred memory of our common sacrifices, 
that we may never lose sight of our common humanity.

Help us, O God, 
to be on our guard against 
believing that the things which constitute the difficulties of our day 
are in the order of nature, 
beyond the control of man. 
Give us the vision, 
the courage, 
and the strength 
to struggle on toward 
the eradication of greed, corruption, and superstition, 
toward the implementation of health, security, and opportunity.

Aid us in our individual and collective efforts 
to rebuild this world 
for a society more free, 
more just, 
and more splendid than ours, 
for an order that will truly approximate 
the hope of Thy Kingdom.

This prayer, initially delivered by Rabbi Joseph Baron as an invocation at the opening of the 12th U.A.W.-C.I.O. Labor Convention in Milwaukee, July 1949, was included in the anthology, <em>The Prayer Book of the Armed Forces</em> (ed. Daniel A. Poling, 1951), pp. 81-82. The prayer was selected for the anthology by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Reuther">Walter P. Reuther</a> (1907-1970), a Lutheran, a leader of organized labor, and a civil rights activist who built the United Automobile Workers (UAW) into one of the most progressive labor unions in American history.
