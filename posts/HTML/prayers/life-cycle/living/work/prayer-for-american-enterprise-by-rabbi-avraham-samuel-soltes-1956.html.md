O Heavenly Father,
as we behold
the abundant display
of this splendid merchandise mart,
our hearts rise up to thank Thee
for the fulness of Thy bounty
which burgeons forth
from this promised land
toward which
Thou didst guide
our fathers' steps.

We thank Thee for this goodly earth,
its shimmering wheat and sturdy corn,
its snowy cotton and its golden flax;
we thank Thee
for its hills of iron and its mountains of brass,
its mines of coal and its wells of oil;
we thank Thee
for its roaring rivers that sing with power,
and its lapping seas
that bring the wide world to our doorstep.

with Thee, O Lord,

in peace and prosperity.

how rich
is the reward
of those who serve each other
and Thee
in honesty and truth
in friendship and in peace.
Amen.
