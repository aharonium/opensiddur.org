In the Book of Exodus, through the plague of <em>dever</em> the domesticated animals of Mitsrayim are made to suffer on behalf of the sins of their Egyptian taskmasters, even though they are, as the Israelites, innocent of their masters' transgressions. Rationally, we might explain away this as tragic by saying that then, just as today, domesticated animals are unjustly made to suffer the callous neglect and the willful abuse of the human keepers for whom they are subjects and ultimately, possessions. In a patriarchy, how do women suffer under this hierarchy? This proto-feminist prayer from 1852 implicitly questions whether a wife under patriarchal authority must submit to the transgressions of her husband. --Aharon Varady

Merciful Lord!

But, Father, in order to obey thy commandments,

I cannot, my God,

I cannot permit my religious observance 
to become dependent

And that if—
which in thy mercy avert—
his wife and children should be so lost
