My God and Father! God of life, gracious Protector in all dangers! With devout heart I invoke Thine almighty protection upon my beloved husband. His avocations and duties have removed him from me, the sacred duty of maintaining and supporting his family have called him away from his home. O Lord! do Thou protect him in all his ways! Do Thou preserve his health and life, strengthen and inspire him, that he may not succumb to the labors and troubles of his avocation. Remove far from him all trials and dangers wherewith journeys are usually beset. Guard him against all mischances, that cunning and malice, falsehood and deceit may devise for him. O grant! that he may find favor in the eyes of all men, and vouchsafe Thy blessing unto all that he may undertake, that his sojourn in a foreign land may be unto our benefit and happiness. Oh! bring him back unto me, unto his home, full of health and cheerfulness, and I will at all times thank Thee, and praise Thy holy name for evermore. <em>Amen</em>.
