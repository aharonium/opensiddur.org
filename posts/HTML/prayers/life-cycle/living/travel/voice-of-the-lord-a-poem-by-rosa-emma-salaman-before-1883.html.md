The voice of the Lord flashed fire, 
And bars of iron gave way; 
They bent—they fell as the waves rose higher, 
And tossed them about in their spray!

Then the mighty sea had rest, 
In its beauty, its clearness, its calm; 
The voice of the Lord was hush'd on its breast. 
Which heaved 'neath His heavenly arm!

<hr />

Titled "The Voice of the Lord" in Henry Abarbanel's <em>English School and Family Reader</em> (1883), this poem was written by Rosa Emma Collins née Salaman (1815-1898). Whether "that day" or "that night" refers to a primordial day of creation or a specific and dangerous storm is unclear, but the language of her poem feels inspired by Psalms (93, 29, and others). The poem was likely published before 1883 elsewhere previously although we haven't been able to locate where. If you know, please leave a comment or <a href="/contact/">contact us</a>.
