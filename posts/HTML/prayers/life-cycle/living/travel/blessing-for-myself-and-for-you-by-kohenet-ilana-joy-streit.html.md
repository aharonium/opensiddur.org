A poem-blessing for trailblazers of many kinds, to honor everyday courage and to inspire trust and self-compassion. May we get the support we need as we midwife the world to come.

<div class="english">
may you keep breathing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each moment
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in and out

may more and more of your cells
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be kissed by oxygen

may you keep trusting your feet, your path, your heart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your feet, your breath, your heart,
may you feel and trust in everything that helps you breathe easier

may your bare feet be caressed by
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cool stones
may you stop often to bask on sun-warmed stone

may you know that the path of trailblazing has been walked by many souls ahead of you

may your roots
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be your roots
may they descend from your feet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and know that they belong just to you

may you inhabit the crown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that is yours to wear

may you á¸¥evruta with Esther, making banquet after banquet
for as long as necessary
and then with one breath, altering the course
of history-herstory (whether real or imaginary)

&nbsp;
may your fruits
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be your fruits
may you taste them, may you share them
and may their seeds spread, until everyone has juice
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dribbling down their chins
