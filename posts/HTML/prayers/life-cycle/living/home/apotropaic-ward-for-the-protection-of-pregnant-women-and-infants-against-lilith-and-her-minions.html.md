And she answered and said to him: 
“For the sake of YHVH postpone the ban 
and I will flee and will swear to you 
in the name of YHVH Elohei Yisrael 
that I will let go this business 
in the case of this woman in childbirth 
and the child to be born to her 
and every pregnant woman so as to do no harm. 
And every time they are repeated 
or I see my names written, 
it will not be in the power of me or of all my gang 
to do evil or harm. 
And these are my names:[foot]The order of corresponding names diverges slightly in parallel texts. Some differences of transliteration are due to the vocalization as interpreted by the scribe/copyist, others are due to common confusion in letters (e.g. daled and resh in the name <em>Odam</em> vs. <em>Orem</em>. --ANV[/foot] 
<em>Lilit</em>, 
<em>Abitu</em>,[foot]"or <em>Abatur</em>, the Mandaic genius, but the possible reading of the copy, <em>Abito</em>, may be preferable, in view of the Greek parallels" (Gottheil in Montgomery 1913). <em>Abito</em> is also found in a similar albeit abbreviated text cited by Moses Gaster, <em>Mystery of the Lord</em> (the original Hebrew title, unclear, but possibly <span class="hebrew" lang="he">סודי ה׳</span>, a book that both Montgomery and I have yet to locate). Florentina Badalanova Geller, in "Between Demonology and Hagiology" (2015) also cites a text from an 18th-century Jewish amulet of German provenance, published by Maria Kaspina from the collection of The Museum of the History of the Jews in Russia ((Амулет для девочки, Германия, 18 век, Музей истории евреев в России, 3473-т6). Geller translates Kaspina's translation in Russian as published in “Илья Пророк и демоны в еврейских магических текстах (сборники заговоров и амулеты 18–20 вв.).” In: Д. И. Антонов, О. Б. Христофорова (eds).

I believe the original amulets from which her transcriptions were derived are <a href="http://mievr.ru/en/collection/show/70">here</a> and <a href="http://mievr.ru/en/collection/show/245">here</a>. There, the name is <span class="hebrew" lang="he">אַבִּיטִוּ</span> (<em>Abitu</em>).

"This tradition harks back to a Talmudic dictum that the body has 248 bones and 365 sinews, which add up to 613, equal to the number of Mosaic commandments in the Pentateuch; this relates to a Talmudic account of the first-century CE Palestinian sage Rabbi Ishmael, whose students dissected the body of a prostitute and were surprised to discover that she had 252 bones (rather than 248), the problem being solved by the explanation that a woman has four additional bones (doors and hinges) in her vagina (Bekhorot 45a). The theme is fairly common in Aramaic magic bowls, which also distinguish between 252 bones for females and 248 bones in males; see Shaked, Ford & Bhayro 2013, 55. See also two magic bowls published by Dan Levene in which a male client is to be protected by the spell in all his 248 limbs, and alternatively the demon is forbidden from harming a female client in all her 252 limbs (Levene 2003, 46, 116)." --note 25 in Florentina Badalanova Geller's "Between Demonology and Hagiology: The Slavonic Rendering of the Semitic Magical Historiola of the Child-Stealing Witch" in <em>In the Wake of the Compendia: Infrastructural Contexts and the Licensing of Empiricism in Ancient and Medieval Mesopotamia</em>. ed.

This historiola is found in the amulet, "№ 42" published in <em>Aramaic Incantation Texts from Nippur, The [University of Pennsylvania] Museum Publications of the Babylonian Section. Vol. 3</em> (Philadelphia, 1913) by James Alan Montgomery (1866-1949) transcribed and annotated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_James_Horatio_Gottheil">Richard Gottheil</a> (1862-1936). The amulet is undated and unprovenanced -- as Dr. Montgomery explains in his introduction: "Towards the close of my work on this volume, Professor Richard Gottheil, who had several years ago thought of publishing the bowls, kindly forwarded me some notes and transcriptions which he had made in his preliminary essays. Among the papers was the copy of a text which is not now found in the Museum. It differed so radically from the other inscriptions that I inquired of Prof. Gottheil if it was taken from a bowl. He replied that he knew of no other source whence the text could have come into his set of papers. Accordingly on the hypothesis that the original text was once in the Museum, I venture to publish Prof. Gottheil's copy, and do so the more readily because of its interesting character and the illustration it affords to several points in the texts above. It contains a form of the Lilith legend, widespread in folklore, and a bowl would have been a perfectly proper place for a text of this prophylactic character..." 

After his translation, Montgomery includes the following important details relayed by Gottheil: 

<blockquote>
Accompanying the text are given some inscribed designs and phrases. A rough figure of a hand (prophylactic against the evil eye) contains the Aramaic legend:

<span class="hebrew" lang="he">אנא מזרעי דיוסף קא (=הא?) אתינא ולא שלטא ביה שנא בישא</span>

“I am the seed-producer (?) of Yosef; when I come, an evil year cannot prevail over him,”—a play of thought between Yosef as controller of the fertility of Egypt and the fertility of the family, and as a good omen for the expectant mother.

A "David’s Shield” contains in the center <span class="hebrew" lang="he">יאהדונהי</span>, a [combined form of the Tetragrammaton with] Adonai. On the left hand <span class="hebrew" lang="he">שטן</span>...in another division <span class="hebrew" lang="he">אבג</span> and nearby <span class="hebrew" lang="he">יתץ</span>, i.e. <span class="hebrew" lang="he">אבג״יתץ</span>, [from the <a href="https://opensiddur.org/prayers/praxes/contemplation/adiryaron-bahiryaron-42-letter-name-in-the-sefer-hapeliah/">42-letter divine name</a> --ANV] to be found in Schwab, <em>Vocab</em>. Another species of the shield more roughly designed contains <span class="hebrew" lang="he">יהוה</span> in the center, flanked with <span class="hebrew" lang="he">יה</span>, etc. and <span class="hebrew" lang="he">אדני</span>, with <span class="hebrew" lang="he">מטטרון</span> and <span class="hebrew" lang="he">סנדלפון</span> on either side. The changes are rung on the possible mutations of <span class="hebrew" lang="he">ילק</span>, and the scripture Deuteronomy 28:10 is cited. Similar charms against the Lilith are to be found at the end of <em>Sefer Raziel</em> and in Buxtorf’s <em>Lexicon</em>, s.v.</blockquote>

The presence of portions of the 42-letter divine name found in <em>Sefer Raziel ha-Malakh</em> (ca. 13th c.) and described by Hai Gaon (939-1038), indicates to me that this variation of the text dates no earlier than the late Geonic period. Shorter versions of this text reproduced in later periods commonly end with the litany of Lilit's names and omit the adjuration of Eliyahu. 

Montgomery offers an additional insight for this Lilit text in the context of the stories appearing in the bowls he reviewed earlier: "The very ancient use of epical narrative as an efficient magical charm was described above p. 62; thus the mere narrative of a demon's power as in the case of Dibbarra, is potent, or, <em>à fortiori</em>, the relation of a triumph over the evil spirit from some sacred legend. In the present case we have the added virtue of the revelation of the demon's names, and she swears that whenever they confront her, she will retire; the knowledge of her names binds her (cf. p. 56)."

The source from which this transcription was derived appeared to me to have been lost,[foot]Shaked and Naveh comment "The provenance of that amulet is uncertain, but there can be no doubt that it is not part of the Nippur excavation material, despite Montgomery’s wavering on this point. The language and style are clearly late medieval or modern (Scholem 1948, "פרקים חדשים מענייני אשמדאי ולילית" תרביץ יט׳" p. 166, n. 25). Montgomery’s text seems to come from an area where Spanish was used. The name of the young mother to whose house Lilith goes may be read as Mercada who is known as (ד״מ is probably for דמתקריא) Vida (?), daughter of Donna." (p.118, n.18)[/foot]but by chance, I found an image of the manuscript <a href="https://twitter.com/CULHebrewMss/status/1385971816812875777">posted to Twitter</a> from the Columbia Hebrew Manuscripts collection with a link to the digital source posted to the <a href="https://archive.org/details/ldpd_11683790_000">Internet Archive</a>. In the collection, the manuscript is known as <a href="https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/8595342">MS General 194</a>. (When Gottheil died in 1936, his papers ultimately landed at the American Jewish Archives in Cincinnati, Ohio, but this manuscript and sundry other documents found their home at Columbia. Thanks to Michelle Chesner at Columbia for this information.)

I've provided a derivation of the source image below. I've altered the contrast in the image to improve its legibility. The manuscript conforms exactly to the girsah of the text as published by Montgomery along with his description of its accompanying segulot.

From the manuscript, I have corrected obvious errors in the transcription published by Montgomery (and corrected the latter's translation). I have included the notes published by Montgomery where significant. See below, "Sources," for Montgomery's original article and complete notes including his important reference to a similar work quoted in translation by Moses Gaster in “Two Thousand Years of the Child-Stealing Witch” (1900) in <em>Folk-lore</em> 11(2), 129–162. --Aharon Varady
