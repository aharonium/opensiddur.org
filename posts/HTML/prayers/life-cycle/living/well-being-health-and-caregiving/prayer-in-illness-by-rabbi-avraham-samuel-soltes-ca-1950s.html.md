O Thou still, small voice
whose love
is the heart of the universe,
my whispering soul
seeks the rhythm of Thy heartbeat,

in its reverberating concords
it may find strength and serenity.

When I behold Thy heavens,
O Lord,
the glories of Thy creation,
what am I
that Thou shouldst hear my whispers,
who am I
that my murmuring
should touch Thy spirit?
Yet, I know
that
the light which fires the stars,
the heat which warms the sun
is the light of my beloved's eyes,
the warmth of his spirit's embrace.

For Thou hast made man in Thine image
And crowned him with Thy glory:

that perceives the wonders of the universe;
--the glory of heart
that hears Thy music in the wind
and sees Thy smile in the rosebud;
--the glory of spirit
that speaks from soul to soul
binding one to another
with the sustaining rapture of love.

the loving touch of Thy hand,
the tender voice of Thy concern.
I know, then,
that Thou art with me, now,
as I entrust myself
to the skill of those
upon whom Thou hast bestowed
Thy healing wisdom.
Be Thou with them
in their art,
and guide their heads and hands
that I may be restored in health
and strength
to continue Thy work--
refracting
into dim and harried lives
the rays of Thy warming light.

hast bestowed the fiery ecstasy of love,
be gracious also unto us
at this hour,
