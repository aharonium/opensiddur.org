"Children's prayer for the recovery of our president" was first published in Rabbi Avraham Soltes’ collection of prayers, תפלה <em>Invocation: Sheaf of Prayers</em> (Bloch 1959) and dated to October 1, 1955. President Eisenhower suffered a <a href="https://text-message.blogs.archives.gov/2016/09/22/heart-attack-strikes-ike-president-eisenhowers-1955-medical-emergency-in-colorado/">severe heart attack</a> on September 24, 1955. Eisenhower initially planned on serving only one term, but he remained flexible in case leading Republicans wanted him to run again. While recovering from the heart attack late in September, he met with his closest advisors to evaluate the GOP's potential candidates. The group concluded that a second term was well advised, and he announced that he would run again in February 1956.
