With a humble, contrite, and trembling heart, I call upon Thee from a wounded breast, that Thou mayest yet preserve for me, for a long, long time, the precious blessing which in Thy unbounded mercy thou hast given unto me.

Without rest, without sleep, without soothing nourishment, the night of my trouble sinks down the starry heaven: every hour which I gloomily drag along by the sick bed of my husband, grows to me as eternity. Severe suffering is the rough guide that leads me to this spot, prostrated is now my domestic happiness, darkened is now the bright crown of my house. Hear, Thou, O God, The Essence of compassion, hear my prayer; I will resign and renounce all vain glory and ambition, only do not snatch the heart from the heart. Yet the hope which the faith of my fathers grafted on my heart, speaks to me in a comforting voice: have confidence, and endure, what the Lord has determined concerning thee! Yea, upon Thy paternal mercy I wait, I pant for thy help according to the in¬ struction conveyed in Thy holy word: <span class="hebrew">הַבּוֹטֵחַ בַּיְיָ חֶסֶד יְסוֹבְבֶנוּ</span> “He that trusteth in the Lord, mercy shall compass him about.”[foot]Psalms 32:10.[/foot] Yes, Thou wilt assuredly answer me, assuredly leave me the most precious good in my possession, assuredly relieve me from the grievous suffering which now so heavily oppresses me. Restore to him O, Father, his wonted vigour of life, restore him to his sacred duties, so that he may long be enabled to labour for his own good and the temporal and spiritual well-being of his family. <em>Amen</em>.
