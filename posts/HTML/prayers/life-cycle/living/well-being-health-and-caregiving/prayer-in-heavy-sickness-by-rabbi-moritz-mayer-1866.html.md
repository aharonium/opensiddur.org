Lord! answer and compassionate me, for I am full of distress, and humbled in mine afflictions. I am bowed down with weakness as a child, and without Thine aid, how shall I bear my troubles? Oh, that my deeds had been worthy of Thine approbation, then had my soul been satisfied and my heart rejoiced. Yet, do Thou, God! regard my contrition, hear my prayer, and lend Thy mercy even as a staff for my support. O Lord! pains and evils are inherited with the nature of man, yet my soul shall not be shaken by their approach. For, on whom shall I call for help but on Thee? And where shall I rest my hope but in Thy mercies? "Though my flesh and my heart fail; God is my consolation, my portion for ever; for, lo, they that are far from Thee shall perish, they that go after the favor of others shall be destroyed."[foot]Psalms 73:26-27.[/foot] Ah! were my days of sorrow lengthened to the number of mine offences, yet, O Lord! I would still bless Thy name, and Thy dispensations, for Thou art my consolation, the resting place of my soul. Then, wherefore should I complain? I will resign myself to Thy will, for Thou, Lord! art the Author of my being, and wilt not destroy the work which Thou hast made. Then shall I profit from my woes, and all times rest in Thy hands; for Thou, my God! art my Savior and my Living Redeemer. <em>Amen</em>.
