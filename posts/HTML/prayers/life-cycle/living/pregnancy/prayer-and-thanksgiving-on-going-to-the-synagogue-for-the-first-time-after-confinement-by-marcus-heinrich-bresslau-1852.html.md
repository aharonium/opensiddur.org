"Prayer and Thanksgiving, On Going to the Synagogue for the First Time After Confinement" by Marcus Heinrich Bresslau was first published in his <a href="/?p=32040">תחנות בנות ישראל <em>Devotions for the Daughters of Israel</em></a> (1852), p. 59-61. 

In his preface to <em>Devotions</em>, Bresslau is clear that his prayers in English were adapted from traditional teḥinot that had earlier been published in France, Germany, and Poland.
