How dark was everything around me but a few hours ago; anxiety filled my heart, and I was afraid of the results of my fears and pains. But when I called in my woe, the Lord heard me, and saved me from my troubles. The hours of anxiety have passed, and now joy and light surround me. Thou, God! hast safely led me through the dangers of the hour of delivery, Thou hast done more unto me than I ventured to hope; thou hast fulfilled my prayer, Thou hast given me a dear, healthful, well-formed child. Therefore, I praise Thy mercy, and shall never forget Thy benefits; my heart and mouth shall ever overflow with thanks and praises of Thy supreme power and loving-kindness.

My God and Lord!
