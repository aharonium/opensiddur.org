"The 10 Books of the Law are the double of the Pentateuch; cf. the Eighth Book of Moses in the Leyden MS. which Dieterich has published at the end of his <em>Abraxas</em>." The simpler answer is that this is an error, either in the original or in Gottheil's transcription, and so we do not need to resort to what might be a fantastic reference to gnostic pseudepigrapha including undiscovered 9th and 10th books of Moses.[/foot]

nor to devour its flesh, 
nor to touch them neither in their 256 limbs[foot]The "256 limbs" are 248 in Jewish lore. "This tradition harks back to a Talmudic dictum that the body has 248 bones and 365 sinews, which add up to 613, equal to the number of Mosaic commandments in the Pentateuch; this relates to a Talmudic account of the first-century CE Palestinian sage Rabbi Ishmael, whose students dissected the body of a prostitute and were surprised to discover that she had 252 bones (rather than 248), the problem being solved by the explanation that a woman has four additional bones (doors and hinges) in her vagina (Bekhorot 45a). The theme is fairly common in Aramaic magic bowls, which also distinguish between 252 bones for females and 248 bones in males; see Shaked, Ford & Bhayro 2013, 55. See also two magic bowls published by Dan Levene in which a male client is to be protected by the spell in all his 248 limbs, and alternatively the demon is forbidden from harming a female client in all her 252 limbs (Levene 2003, 46, 116)." --note 25 in Florentina Badalanova Geller's "Between Demonology and Hagiology: The Slavonic Rendering of the Semitic Magical Historiola of the Child-Stealing Witch" in <em>In the Wake of the Compendia: Infrastructural Contexts and the Licensing of Empiricism in Ancient and Medieval Mesopotamia</em>. ed.

This is an incantation text, "№ 42" published in <em>Aramaic Incantation Texts from Nippur. The [University of Pennsylvania] Museum Publications of the Babylonian Section. Vol. 3</em> (Philadelphia, 1913) by James Alan Montgomery (1866-1949). 

I have corrected obvious errors in Gottheil's transcription and consequently in Montgomery's translation. I have paraphrased commentary of Montgomery with the text and I have also altered his translation in parts. See below, "Sources," for Montgomery's original article and complete notes including his important reference to a similar work quoted in translation by Moses Gaster in “Two Thousand Years of the Child-Stealing Witch” (1900) in <em>Folk-lore</em> 11(2), 129–162.

The text is undated and unprovenaced and the actual source manuscript from which this text was transcribed appears to have been lost, unfortunately, as Dr. Montgomery explains in his introduction: "Towards the close of my work on this volume, Professor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_James_Horatio_Gottheil">Richard Gottheil</a> [(1862-1936)], who had several years ago thought of publishing the bowls, kindly forwarded me some notes and transcriptions which he had made in his preliminary essays. Among the papers was the copy of a text which is not now found in the Museum. It differed so radically from the other inscriptions that I inquired of Prof. Gottheil if it was taken from a bowl. He replied that he knew of no other source whence the text could have come into his set of papers. Accordingly on the hypothesis that the original text was once in the Museum, I venture to publish Prof. Gottheil's copy, and do so the more readily because of its interesting character and the illustration it affords to several points in the texts above. It contains a form of the Lilith legend, widespread in folklore, and a bowl would have been a perfectly proper place for a text of this prophylactic character..." After his translation, Montgomery includes the following important details relayed by Gottheil, which I think argues for this text originating from a <em>qame'a</em> that <strong><em>is not</em></strong> an incantation bowl, mainly due to the format restrictions of such objects. 

<blockquote>
Accompanying the text are given some inscribed designs and phrases. A rough figure of a hand (prophylactic against the evil eye) contains the Aramaic legend:

<span class="hebrew">אנא מזרעי דיוסף קא (? הא =) אתינא ולא שלטא ביה שנא בישא׃</span>

“I am the seed-producer (?) of Yosef; when I come, an evil year cannot prevail over him,”—a play of thought between Yosef as controller of the fertility of Egypt and the fertility of the family, and as a good omen for the expectant mother.

A "David’s Shield” contains in the center <span class="hebrew">יאהדונהי</span>, a [combined form of the Tetragrammaton with] Adonai. On the left hand <span class="hebrew">שטן</span>, “Satan,” in another division <span class="hebrew">אבג</span> and nearby <span class="hebrew">יחץ</span>, i.e. <span class="hebrew">אבג״יחץ</span>, [from the 42 letter divine name --ANV] to be found in Schwab, <em>Vocab</em>. Another species of the shield more roughly designed contains <span class="hebrew">יהוה</span> in the center, flanked with <span class="hebrew">יה</span>, etc. and <span class="hebrew">אדני</span>, with <span class="hebrew">מטטרון</span> and <span class="hebrew">סנדלפון</span> on either side. The changes are rung on the possible mutations of <span class="hebrew">ילק</span>, and the scripture Deuteronomy 28:10 is cited. Similar charms against the Lilith are to be found at the end of <em>Sefer Raziel</em> and in Buxtorf’s <em>Lexicon</em>, s.v.</blockquote>

There just does not seem to me to be enough room for all of these additional verses, symbols, and divine names in the center of an amulet bowl. A <em>qame'a</em> on parchment seems much more probable. The presence of portions of the 42-letter divine name found in <em>Sefer Raziel ha-Malakh</em> (ca. 13th c.) and described by Hai Gaon (939-1038), indicates to me that this variation of the text dates no earlier than the late Geonic period. Shorter versions of this text reproduced in later periods commonly end with the litany of Lilit's names and omit the adjuration of Eliyahu. 

Montgomery offers an additional insight for this Lilit text in the context of the stories appearing in the bowls he reviewed earlier: "The very ancient use of epical narrative as an efficient magical charm was described above p. 62; thus the mere narrative of a demon's power as in the case of Dibbarra, is potent, or, <em>à fortiori</em>, the relation of a triumph over the evil spirit from some sacred legend. In the present case we have the added virtue of the revelation of the demon's names, and she swears that whenever they confront her, she will retire; the knowledge of her names binds her (cf. p. 56)."
