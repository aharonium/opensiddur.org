In a flow of warm tears of gratitude 
I this day tread the steps of Thy house; 
in grateful raptures at the mercy shewn to me 
during my confinement, 
and Thy healing grace after it, 
I offer to Thy paternal love my inmost thanks—
the outpouring of my soul, 
which may be a substitute for the sacrifice of blood, 
which according to Thy law I was bound to offer to Thee, 
Fountain of Goodness.

And when she shall have outgrown the cradle, 
then bless her O God with the spirit of light and truth. 
Grant that she may not harbour in her heart 
any impure thoughts, 
any vain desire, 
any guilty cravings; 
and that all her powers may be directed 
to the ennoblement of her mind.

She is yet asleep in calm repose, 
and is not yet awakened by any tempest of life: 
therefore ere the flower is developed, 
ere the soft heart of the child 
inclines to the alluring strains of evil, 
bless it, that it may soon acknowledge and love Thee.

Eternal grace! 
do not deprive the mother’s breast of this presented good, 
preserve it to me unto remote days,

on the last evening of my life 
fades away, 
may she be my comfort. 
<em>Amen</em>.
