May the One 
who blessed our ancestors 
bless you, little one, who was born 
in your own time and at your own hour. 
May you follow in the footsteps 
of your ancestor Jacob 
who arrived after Esau and was not expected, 
and Peretz, the son of Tamar, 
who burst forth early surprising the midwives.

We say <em>b’shaah tovah</em>, may it be in a good hour, 
and the hour when you were born was truly good, 
as you are a perfect image of God. 
It is impossible to predict the exact moment 
when trees will blossom and give fruit; 
we can only bless its produce. 
Likewise, we can only bless 
the ongoing miracle of your gradual unfolding into life 
and the miracle of each of your precious breaths.

You came into the world 
at your own time and in your own way; 
may you continue to grow and thrive
 along your own unique, curving, and surprising pathways. 
May we, your parent(s) and your loved ones, 
have the <em>z’chut</em>, the privilege, 
of raising you to a life of Torah (learning and community), 
<em>chuppah</em> (loving relationships), 
and <em>maasim tovim</em> (good acts).
