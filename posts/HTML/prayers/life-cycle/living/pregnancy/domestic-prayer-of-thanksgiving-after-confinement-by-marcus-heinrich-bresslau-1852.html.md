Bless, All-merciful God this tender creature, 
ere yet the spirit of evil gains mastery over it; 
ere the bud is developed, 
ere from the tender germ 
a world unfolds itself within the child’s heart, 
cause a ray from the fulness of the light of Thy goodness 
to penetrate its soul, that it may soon learn 
to distinguish the good from the evil, 
to love the former and hate the latter.

Bless it with obedience to its parents, 
as Thou didst bless our father Isaac; 
cause virtue to illumine the dark road of its life, 
then my motherly care will be richly compensated, 
and my inward wishes will be realized. 
<em>Amen</em>.
