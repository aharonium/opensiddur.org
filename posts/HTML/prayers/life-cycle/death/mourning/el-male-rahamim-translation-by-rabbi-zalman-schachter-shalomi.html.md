This "praying translation" of El Malé Raḥamim is included in Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi's <a href="http://opensiddur.org/?p=29177">Sabbath Supplement</a> to his <em><a href="http://opensiddur.org/?p=177">Siddur Tehillat Hashem Yidaber Pi ~ As I Can Say It (for Praying in the Vernacular)</a></em> (2009) where he suggests it may be used by a mourner when and where there is no minyan.

Macy Nulman writes in his entry on “El Malé Raḥamim” in <em>Encyclopedia of Jewish Prayer</em> (1993, pp. 92-93):

<blockquote>Ayl Malay Rahamim came into being in Western and Eastern communities, where it was recited for the martyrs of the Crusades and the Chmielnicki massacres. Eliezer Landshuth has various versions of this prayer, as it was recited in different parts of Europe.4 Israel Davidson has twenty-two versions listed in his Thesaurus of Medieval Hebrew Poetry. 

In most prayer books, the phrase differs as to <em>al kanefay hashekhinah</em> ("on the wings of Divine Presence") or taḥat kanefay hashekhinah ("under the wings of Divine Presence"). Some prayer books give both versions side by side. According to Rabbi Isaiah Horowitz (SHeLaH), the correct version is <em>al kanefay hashekhinah</em> since the word taḥat is used in conjunction with proselytes (gerim), as it is written, <em>Asher bat laḥashot taḥat kenafav</em>--"Under whose wings thou art come to take refuge" (Ruth 2:12). In addition the prayer for a convert to Judaism reads, <em>Sheva laḥashot taḥat kanefay Elohay Yisrael</em> ("who came to find protection under the wings of the God of Israel"). A further distinction is made between <em>al</em> and <em>taḥat</em> in that the latter is used to mean heavenly protection from danger, whereas the former refers to spiritual elevation as indicated in this prayer.
