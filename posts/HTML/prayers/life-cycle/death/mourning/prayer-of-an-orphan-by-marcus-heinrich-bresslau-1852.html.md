Heavenly Father! Thy inscrutable justice has willed it, that my dear parent[foot]Or Parents, if an orphan of both father and mother.[/foot] should be taken away from me, and that with this loss I should be deprived of my greatest happiness. Alas Father! how heavy and afflicting was this punishment for a weak heart, which—now already weighed down by intense grief—would lie in the dust, had not the religion of my fathers taught me that Thou art called <span class="hebrew">אֲבִי יְתוֹמִים</span> “Father of Orphans,”[foot]Psalms 68:6.[/foot] I am now Thy child, Thy heir, Thou wilt be my parent unto eternity, Thou the mightiest Father in heaven and earth. Thou wilt hear me as often as I call upon Thee, Thou wilt protect me when I walk in Thy ways. To Thy paternal hand I now commit my spiritual weal. I trust in Thy fatherly love, and exclaim with the psalmist <span class="hebrew">כִּי־אַתָּה תָּאִיר נֵרִי יְיָ אֱלֹהַי יַגִּיהַּ חָשְׁכִּי</span> “For thou wilt light my lamp: the Lord my God will enlighten my darkness.”[foot]Psalms 18:29.[/foot] <em>Amen</em>.
