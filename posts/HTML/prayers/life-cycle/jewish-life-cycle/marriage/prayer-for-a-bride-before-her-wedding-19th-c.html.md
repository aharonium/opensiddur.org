My Dear Father in Heaven, gracious, great L-rd, who peers down from Your most lofty heavens upon the smallest earthly creatures.  All creations that have a broken heart turn to You, merciful G-d; all who are in an affected state turn to You.  And I too turn to You, my L-rd, on my holy day.  Before you I now lay my restless heart and the warm tears of my eyes.  Hear me please, O great L-rd, accept the supplication of your servant who entreats you with a bowed head, with trembling knees.  My heart is full as the great sea; my thoughts wandering and I don’t know the proper order of my prayers; what will best calm my restless heart.

Now the time has come to take leave of my parents, from those most beloved to me in the world, who cared for me and spent so much energy on my behalf.  As I depart my parents’ home, I also take leave of the friends of my youth, of all that was so dear to me, so that I may go forth to dedicate myself to a man that you have set aside for me.

I am quite unprepared, and awesome are the responsibilities that I am about to take upon myself; O L-rd, please hear my youthful prayer, receive my tears that I now cry before You; grant fortune to the road I am about to take; send your angels, the angels of peace, they shall escort me on my new path.

May you send blessing and peace to me and the man that you have granted me; I shall do all that I must as a wife – to fulfil all the obligations that You have established in Your Holy Torah.  May You always grant me to find favor and grace in the eyes of my husband; that there be envy or hate between us, but only peace and tranquility.  May love and favor always be our companion throughout our lives; may You grant us a peaceful life, with a livelihood from Your Full Hand – with honor and without shame, proudly and without grief; and I will praise and sing of Your Holy Name all my life; Amen.
