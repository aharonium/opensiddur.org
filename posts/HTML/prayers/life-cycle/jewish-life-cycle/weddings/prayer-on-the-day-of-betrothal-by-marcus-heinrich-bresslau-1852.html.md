All-merciful Father! God of Love! 
Thou hast created for the soul 
another soul to sympathise with it, 
for the heart 
another heart to beat similar to it. 
O, grant that I may have chosen 
a loving, noble being, 
which among millions has been created for me, 
and which can render me truly happy.

Pour out, All-loving Father, 
the fulness of Thy mercy over his head,

grant him sober reflection in hours of joy, fortitude and resignation 
in time of trouble.

O That the spirit of true love may animate him, 
for only such love it is, that renders us charitable and great, 
humble and courageous! 
It is such love only that beautifies the prospect of those fields, 
whither all Thy creatures will have to travel 
to attain salvation and higher felicity. 
<em>Amen</em>.
