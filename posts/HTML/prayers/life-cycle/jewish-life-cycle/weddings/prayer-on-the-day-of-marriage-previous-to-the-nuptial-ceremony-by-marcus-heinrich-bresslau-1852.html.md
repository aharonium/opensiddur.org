Creator in Heaven! 
I shall soon approach Thee at the side of my companion in life, 
whom Thou from the fulness of Thy grace and truth hath bestowed upon me; 
soon will be pronounced the sentence 
which will closely interweave me with the fate of that being; 
be it therefore Thy will, O Father, 
that no power on earth loosen our band.

grant us mild temperament, tenderness and fidelity; 
grant that I divide my heart without reserve with my betrothed, 
and that after Thee, I may love him most.
