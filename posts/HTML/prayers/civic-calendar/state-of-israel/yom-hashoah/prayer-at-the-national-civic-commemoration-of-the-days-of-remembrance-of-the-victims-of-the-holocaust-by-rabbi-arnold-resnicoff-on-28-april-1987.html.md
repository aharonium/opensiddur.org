O Lord our God
help us pray – as our <em>ceremony</em> ends,
that our <em>service</em> might begin.
And keep us from forgetting the difference.

Keep us from feeling too good
about what we say and do today,
for words are not enough,
and it is far too easy to recall
gigantic evil done by others,
yet miss the link to seeds of future horror
in our own lives:
in apathy, in the careless racial slur,
in blindness to a neighbor's wound,
or deafness to his cry...

<tr><td style="vertical-align:top;">
<div class="liturgy" lang="he">

</span></div></td>
 
<td style="vertical-align:top;">
<div class="english" lang="en">
And yet,
let us take some pride – and hope –
in what we do today,
for sometimes, words can pave the way:
songs and prayers
can bear witness to the good within us still;
can give dreams a voice –
a call which might be, must be, heard,
to give direction to our lives.
</div></td></tr>

<div class="liturgy" lang="he">

</span></div></td>
 
<td style="vertical-align:top;">
<div class="english" lang="en">
So, <em>from</em> the Holocaust, we learn:
when we deny humanity in others,
we destroy humanity within ourselves.
When we reject the human, and the holy,
in any neighbor's soul,
then we unleash the beast, and the barbaric,
in our own heart.
</div></td></tr>


<tr><td style="vertical-align:top;">
<div class="liturgy" lang="he">

</span></div></td>
 
<td style="vertical-align:top;">
<div class="english" lang="en">
And, <em>since</em> the Holocaust, we pray:
if the time has not yet dawned
when we can all proclaim our faith in God,
then let us say at least
that we admit we are not gods ourselves.
If we cannot yet see the face of God in others,
then let us see, at least,
a face as human as our own.
</div></td></tr>


<tr><td style="vertical-align:top;">
<div class="liturgy" lang="he">

</span></div></td>
 
<td style="vertical-align:top;">
<div class="english" lang="en">
So long ago
the Bible taught that life might be
a blessing or a curse:[foot]Cf. Deuteronomy 11:26, Deuteronomy 30:19[/foot]&nbsp;
the choice is in our hands.
Today we vow:
the curse will be remembered.
</div></td></tr>


<tr><td style="vertical-align:top;">
<div class="liturgy" lang="he">

</span></div></td>
 
<td style="vertical-align:top;">
<div class="english" lang="en">
But our prayer must also be:
to fight despair;
to find the strength, the courage,
and the faith,
<em>to keep alive the dream</em>
that – through us and through our children –
the <em>blessing</em> might still be.
</div></td></tr>
