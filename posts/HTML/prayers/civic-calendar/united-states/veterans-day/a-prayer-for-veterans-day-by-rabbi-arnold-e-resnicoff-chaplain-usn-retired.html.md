Almighty God, on this day in 1918,
—11th day, 11th month, 11th hour of that day—
we signed the armistice to end the war:
“the war to end all wars,”[foot]A term originating from a series of articles by H.G. Wells published in 1914, referring to what eventually came to be known as the First World War of 1914–1918. Find "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_war_to_end_war">The War to End War</a>" (Wikipedia).[/foot] we prayed.

But other wars would come 
and many more would serve.
So Armistice Day—renamed, reborn—now Veterans Day[foot]Armistice Day was renamed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterans_Day">Veterans Day</a> in 1954 at the behest of a number of US Veterans organizations.[/foot] 
to recognize, salute, all who answered duty’s call.
