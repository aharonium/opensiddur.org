Almighty Father, 
Thou who controllest the destinies of all men 
and in whose hand lies the fate of all nations, 
we have appeared before Thee this day 
with feelings of deep thankfulness. 
We are grateful that the war which brought 
so much destruction, 
so much sorrow, 
and so much death, 
ceased. 
We recall the heroism 
which so many of our brave spirits showed, 
and the noble sacrifices 
so many made at the call of their beloved land. 
We remember, with affection, 
all those devoted souls who gave their lives for their country.

But, Almighty God, 
futile would have been our observance of this sacred day, 
of no avail will have been all the sufferings of our martyrs 
if there be not born in us the conviction 
that wars must no longer afflict mankind—
wars with all their terrors—
wars in which the hand of one man is turned against his brother! 
“For have we not all one father? 
Hath not one God created us?”[foot]Malachi 2:10.[/foot]

We know that America came forth victorious, 
because all its people 
from one end of the land to the other, 
irrespective of race or creed, 
were united for a common purpose. 
Grant us the wisdom to banish hate 
so that no internal dissension 
may disrupt our living together in fellowship.

"Armistice-Day Prayer" was published in Rabbi Jacob Bosniak's <em><a href="https://opensiddur.org/compilations/sifrei-tehinot/likutei-tefilot-pulpit-and-public-prayers-compiled-and-edited-by-rabbi-jacob-bosniak-1927/">Likutei Tefilot: Public and Pulpit Prayers</a></em> (1930). It may have been published elsewhere, earlier, as Rabbi Solomon tragically died at the age of 40 that year. We have been unable to find an earlier publication.
