with the lash shall be paid with another drawn with the sword,

The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.’[foot]Abraham Lincoln, <a href="https://opensiddur.org/readings-and-sourcetexts/mekorot/non-canonical/exoteric/modern/the-second-inaugural-address-of-president-abraham-lincoln-on-4-march-1865/">Second Inaugural Address</a>, 4 March 1865.[/foot]

"An American Covenant of Brotherhood" was first published in Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan's <em><a href="/?p=17387">A Sabbath Prayer Book</a></em> (Jewish Reconstructionist Foundation, 1945), p. 538-541. (A slightly modified version was published under the title "<a href="https://archive.org/details/the-faith-of-america-readings-songs-and-prayers-for-the-celebration-of-american-holidays-1951/page/64/mode/2up">The Spiritual Heritage of America</a>" in <em><a href="/?p=34753">The Faith of America: Readings, Songs, and Prayers for the Celebration of American Holidays</a></em> (Jewish Reconstructionist Foundation 1951), p. 65-67.) I have replaced all archaisms (Thee, Thy, Thou) in reference to divinity. --Aharon Varady
