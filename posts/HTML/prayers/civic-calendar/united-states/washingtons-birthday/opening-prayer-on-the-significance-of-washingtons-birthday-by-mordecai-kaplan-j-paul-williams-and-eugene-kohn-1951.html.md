This closing prayer for Washington's Birthday was first published in <em><a href="/?p=34753">The Faith of America: Readings, Songs, and Prayers for the Celebration of American Holidays</a></em> (Jewish Reconstructionist Foundation 1951), p. 51. I have replaced archaisms in this prayer (thee, thy, thou, etc.) and made other related changes. --Aharon Varady
