We thank you, O God, 
for the capacity to work 
wherein human beings are different from all other living beings. 
For these others survive 
by adjusting themselves to their environment, 
but humanity has survived 
by transforming its environment 
and adjusting it to itself.[foot]This statement is demonstrably false, as there are numerous other creatures that transform their environment to their benefit. Beavers are perhaps the most obvious example. The rhetorical direction within which this statement is placed appears intended to underscore the tremendous hubris of humanity's labor "when our plans conform not to [God's] designs" (see following stanza). Distinguishing the agency of human beings from other animals seems to be a trope of these mid-20th century labor day prayers.[/foot]

"Dignity of Labor" is a prayer for Labor Day first published in <em><a href="/?p=34753">The Faith of America: Readings, Songs, and Prayers for the Celebration of American Holidays</a></em> (Jewish Reconstructionist Foundation 1951), p.176-177. It is unclear from this publication whether the prayer was written by Mordecai Kaplan, J. Paul Williams, or Eugene Kohn separately or together in collaboration. I have replaced archaisms in this prayer (thee, thy, thou, etc.) and made other changes to make this prayer more gender-neutral (e.g. by replacing 'Man' with 'human beings.') --Aharon Varady
