Our God and Creator: 
&nbsp;
On this day we consecrate to you 
the labor of muscle and mind. 
We thank you for the gifts of life 
and for the wherewithal to sustain it. 
Yours is the earth and all it holds,[foot]Cf. Psalms 24:1.[/foot] 
and you have unlocked its resources 
for the service of humanity. 
Yours is the energy pent in the seed, 
and yours is the strength and skill of humanity, 
whereby they cause the fields to yield to them 
food in abundance.

When men and women bring forth 
that which satisfies their needs, 
it is you who instruct them. 
When they exchange with one another 
what they can best do and make, 
it is you who guides them. 
You desire that all people have at their disposal 
what each most needs for health and comfort 
and for the full use of the gifts 
wherewith you have endowed them.

Bless our toil, O God, 
that no one in this land of ours

for health of body and mind.

Withhold us from selling our labor

to banish poverty, 
disease, 
and war, 
and to establish your rule 
of freedom, 
brotherhood, 
and peace.

"Opening Prayer on the Significance of [Labor] Day" was first published in <em><a href="/?p=34753">The Faith of America: Readings, Songs, and Prayers for the Celebration of American Holidays</a></em> (Jewish Reconstructionist Foundation 1951), p.165. It is unclear from this publication whether the prayer was written by Mordecai Kaplan, J. Paul Williams, or Eugene Kohn separately or together in collaboration. I have replaced archaisms in this prayer (thee, thy, thou, etc.) and made other changes to make this prayer more gender-neutral (e.g. by replacing 'man' with 'humanity.') --Aharon Varady
