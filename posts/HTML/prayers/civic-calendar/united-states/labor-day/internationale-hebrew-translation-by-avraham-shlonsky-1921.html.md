Debout les damnés de la terre,
Debout les forçats de la faim.
La raison tonne en son cratére.
C’est l’éruption de la fin.
Du passé faisons table rase.
Foules, esclaves, debout, debout.
Le monde va changer de base.
Nous ne sommes rien, soyons tout.

Stand up, the damned (people) of the earth,
Stand up, the starved forced laborers.
Reason thunders in its crater.
This is the final eruption.
[Out] of the past let us make a clean slate.
Masses, slaves, stand up, stand up.
The world is going to change from its base.
We are nothing, let us be everything.

מִגַּב כָּפוּף נִפְרֹק הָעֹל

Arise shake yourself, a hapless people,[foot]Cf. Isaiah 52:1-2 with "O (daughter of) Zion," replaced with a "hapless people." For <span class="hebrew">חֵלְכָה</span> (hapless), find Psalms 10:8-10 and Psalms 10:14-15 in their context.[/foot]
a people of slaves[foot]Cf. Deuteronomy 26:5-6. Following after the Russian and Yiddish translations. Shlonsky alters "the whole world of hungry people and slaves" in Russian, to "a people of slaves..."[/foot],  wasted with hunger;[foot]Cf. Deuteronomy 32:24.[/foot]
the fire of vengeance has scorched the heart.[foot]Cf. Psalms 94:1-2, Psalms 94:6, and Psalms 94:14-15 in their context of avenging the acts of the wicked. While the Russian and Yiddish translations, have the metaphor of "burning" directed towards the struggle, Shlonsky evokes the theme of social justice in the psalm according to Kuzar. In the context of early Zionism, I think it would evoke passions of vengeance against the injustices against Jews in the pogroms occurring at the very time Shlonsky was translating this Hebrew version.[/foot] 
Prepare for the battle against the enemy.
Let us demolish the old world to its foundation;
from a bent back we shall dismantle the yoke.[foot]Cf. Jeremiah 28:4, the yoke of oppression in the Diaspora.[/foot]
Let us establish our world!
Yesterday is nothing, tomorrow is everything!

There is no one, no savior to fight our struggle,[foot]Cf. the brakhah concluding the reading of Megilat Esther. <span class="hebrew">בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ אֱלֹהֵֽינוּ מֶֽלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם, (הָאֵל) הָרָב אֶת רִיבֵֽנוּ וְהַדָּן אֶת דִּינֵֽנוּ וְהַנּוֹקֵם אֶת נִקְמָתֵֽנוּ וְהַמְשַׁלֵּם גְּמוּל לְכָל אוֹיְבֵי נַפְשֵֽׁנוּ וְהַנִּפְרָע לָֽנוּ מִצָּרֵֽינוּ. בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ הַנִּפְרָע לְעַמּוֹ יִשְׂרָאֵל מִכָּל צָרֵיהֶם הָאֵל הַמּוֹשִֽׁיעַ:‏</span>. (Many thanks to Rabbi George Barnard for noting this.) The blessing after the Megillah serves to attribute to God the victory of the tale of near genocide, a tale in which the divine name is absent and any divine intervention is hidden (or implicit). By providing this reference, Shlonsky, I believe, subverts the explicit denial of God in Pottier's original lyrics while in no way dulling their edge.[/foot]
no god, no king, no giant
to break through with an outstretched arm.[foot]Exodus 6:6[/foot]
We are on the path toward the Light!
While thunderous doom will clap
upon our enemy's stupefied heads,
upon us sunshine shall emerge
to pour out her warm radiance.

The <em>Chanson Internationale</em> (‘International Song’) was originally written in 1871 by Eugène Pottier, a French public transportation worker, member of the International Workingmen’s Association (The First International), and activist of the Paris Commune. He wrote it to pay tribute to the commune violently destroyed that year. The song became the official anthem of The Second International, of the Comintem, and between 1921 and 1944 also of the Soviet Union. Most socialist and communist parties adopted it as their anthem during the last decades of the 19th century and throughout the 20th century, adapting it in local languages (Russian, Yiddish, etc.) to their particular ideological framework. Several stanzas of the anthem were first translated into Hebrew by <a href="https://www.hartman.org.il/avraham-shlonsky/">Avraham Shlonsky</a> in 1921. As Ron Kuzar explains,[foot]Ron Kuzar, "<a href="https://www.academia.edu/2651746/Translating_the_Internationale_Unity_and_dissent_in_the_encoding_of_proletarian_solidarity">Translating the Internationale: unity and dissent in the encoding of proletarian solidarity</a>" in <em>Journal of Pragmatics</em> 34 (2002) 87-109.[/foot] 

<blockquote>This is the only version [of the Internationale] that every Jewish Israeli has been singing in Hebrew, regardless of exact political affiliation. Shlonsky was an important poet of Labor-Zionism, the stream of Zionism which was becoming hegemonic in Palestine from the 1920s holding this power through the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 and till 1977. Striving to foster a Jewish national entity in Palestine, Labor-Zionism was guided by the principle of Constructive Socialism, which advocated selective postponement of class struggle during the phases of nation-building, partly substituting class struggle with cooperation with capital invested in a productive national spirit, especially when carried out under the auspices of the organizational and political power of Labor-Zionism (Horowitz and Lissak, 1977: 187, 203-207) (see Fig. 1). Its objective was to build a national economy which ascribed priority and channeled funds to the creation of employment opportunities for the Jewish workers and to the settlement of Jews in the country’s frontiers in several types of cooperative communities.

Labor Zionism had different political streams in it, ranging from social democracy to radical Marxism, but on the whole, it did not deny - at least in its earlier phases - the socialist revolutionary tradition. During 1921-1922, Shlonsky was a member of the Labor Legion, the first countrywide organization of Jewish workers’ communes in Palestine, which undertook road paving, stone mining and cutting, house construction, and other hard labor jobs. The Legion was formed in the Valley of Yizre’el, and later spread to other parts of the country. Shlonsky viewed himself as a “road paving poet” ([1927] 1961: 165), a binomial definition which embodies his insistence on the professionality of the poet, albeit combined with a personal involvement in physical labor. Before the 1920s, “the ideological attitude towards literary production that expressed labor life, especially when written by the workers themselves, involved also a moratorium on aesthetic judgment. The mechanism of acceptance sometimes simply evaded literary evaluation according to established norms, which were otherwise applied to literature” (Hever, 1994: 75), in order to enhance a literary production in Hebrew, which lauded the Zionist project and praised its agents.

Shlonsky had come to Palestine equipped with an avant-garde modernism which declined to accept one-sided writing, preferring to stand at the forefront of political involvement and debate. During the two years of his membership in the Labor Legion, Shlonsky was not yet able to materialize the independence of a professional poet in his own life; this started to happen only when he moved to Tel-Aviv in 1922. But his insistence on quality, on the expression of the personal angle, and on the right to culturally intervene, not only to collectively reflect, was part of the European modernism that he imported. To be sure, “the dichotomy [between the traditional and the modernist literary viewpoints] was not between mobilized versus unmobilized literature, but between more principled intellectual commitments, which would materialize in the different literary structures emanating from them” (Hever, 1994: 71).

In a later autobiographical text, Shlonsky recounts that already while in the Labor Legion he had a literary dialogue with “my secret readers” on “old and new in poetry, on necessary transformation in contents and forms”. It was this small group that “‘ordered’ from me the translation of the Internationale, for the first celebration of the First of May in the Valley of Yizre’el” ([1954] 1964: 895). Shlonsky faced the need to deal with the tension between preserving, on the one hand, the principled socialist heritage of class struggle and international solidarity of all workers, and on the other hand provisionally suspending it under the local conditions of nation building and national solidarity. The Arab worker, with whom the Labor Legion was competing for employment opportunities, was both a canditate for class solidarity and a challenger of the emergent separate Jewish national economy.</blockquote>

The text of Shlonsky's translation found here is as found elsewhere, in <a href="https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/האינטרנציונל">Hebrew Wikipedia</a> and in <a href="https://www.zemereshet.co.il/m/song.asp?id=164">Zemereshet</a>. (I haven't yet been able to locate the source for the additional two stanzas given for Shlonsky.) The English translation of Shlonsky's first stanza of the Internationale was made by Ron Kuzar, to which I have made a few small changes for the sake of a smoother reading. I have also added translations for the remaining two stanzas.
