Our God and God of our ancestors, 
as we [prepare to] observe another Memorial Day in America, 
bless us with the gifts of memory and understanding, 
that we may appreciate the true meaning of this [that] day, 
an annual occasion to honor the brave men and women 
who gave their lives for our country 
and for their fellow citizens.

God of compassion, 
let those who made the ultimate sacrifice, 
so that we may live in freedom, 
rest in peace, 
honored by a grateful nation.  
Remember their parents, 
partners, 
children 
and all the loved ones they left behind.  
Protect and comfort them; 
bring them peace.

God of justice, 
remind us of the debt we owe 
to those who lost their lives in the defense of our nation, 
and to the families that go on without them.  
Fill the heart of every American 
with pride in those who served, 
and caring concern for their survivors.

May it be Your will 
that every American be re-dedicated 
to the task of building a nation 
worthy of the sacrifices made by our honored dead.  
And may it be Your will, also, 
that all of us pursue a just peace throughout the world, 
so that no more lives are lost in armed conflict 
anywhere in Your creation.
