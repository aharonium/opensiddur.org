O Lord our God and God of generations past,
you commanded us, “remember”:[foot]Cf. Deuteronomy 32:7.[/foot]
remember, pass on, stories of the past,  but also  
recall, retell dreams and promises of future, better times.

I know some have given up on prayer,
Some have lost their faith in faith.

Dream with me
That those we honor on this day
Will never be forgotten,
But we will build a future
When we need not dig new military graves,
And no new names need be inscribed
on memorials of war;
a time we beat our swords to plowshares
And war will be no more.

Today, to honor those who sacrificed their lives
Let us embrace old patriotic words –
“The Liberty Song”[foot]"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Liberty_Song">The Liberty Song</a>" -- a pre-American Revolutionary War song with lyrics by Founding Father John Dickinson. The song is set to the tunes of "Heart of Oak", the anthem of the Royal Navy of the United Kingdom. The song itself was first published in two colonial newspapers, the <em>Pennsylvania Journal</em> and the <em>Pennsylvania Gazette</em>, both on July 7, 1768.[/foot] that once inspired founders of our nation,
And now must touch our hearts, inspire us again:
&nbsp;
“Join hand in hand, brave Americans all,
By uniting we stand, by dividing we fall.”[foot]From the seventh stanza of “The Liberty Song.” Find note above.[/foot]
