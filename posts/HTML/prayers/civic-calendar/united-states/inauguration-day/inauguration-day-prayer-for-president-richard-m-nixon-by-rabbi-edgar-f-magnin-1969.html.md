In the beginning, 
God created the heavens and the earth, 
and the darkness was upon the face of the deep. 
God said, "Let there be light," 
and there was light.[foot]Genesis 1:3[/foot] 
This was not the light of the sun nor the moon, 
nor a billion blazing worlds. 
It was the Sheḳinah, 
the Logos, the Word, 
the Divine Presence, 
that was to reflect itself 
upon the human mind and soul.

This is the light

morality, 
the yearning for freedom, 
that inspired the prophets and sages of old 
and through all ages.

This is the American ideal, 
born at the time of creation itself, 
cherished by the Founding Fathers, 
who were practical idealists. 
They knew history well. 
They warned against the dangers of ignorance, 
stupidity, 
apathy, 
selfishness, 
immorality, 
and dissension within our borders 
and between nations. 
They knew full well that patience, 
courage, 
good will, 
and cooperation 
were preferable to hysteria 
and emotionalism, 
and that age-old problems 
and complex problems 
cannot be solved with instant answers 
and simple answers. 
They knew 
that there is no substitute in the world 
for commonsense.

The night is long, 
and it is still dark 
as far as civilization goes. 
We will never be perfect, 
for man is not perfect; 
but we are on the way. 
Our country is still great, 
and it will be greater, 
with hope in our hearts, 
and work and rededication. 
There are a few faint streaks of pink in the sky. 
We await the dawn.
