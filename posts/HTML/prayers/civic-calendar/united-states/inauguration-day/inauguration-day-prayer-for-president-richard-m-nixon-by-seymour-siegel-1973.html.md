O Lord, Creator of all beginnings: 
We thank You for the opportunity of starting anew. 
Today those whom we have chosen to lead our country — 
President Nixon and Vice President Spiro Agnew — 
pledge again their commitment to serve You 
and this great and blessed Nation. 
Grant them the wisdom to understand their true task; 
the courage to pursue it; 
and the health and vigor to persist in it.

O Lord, source of all peace: 
We ask You with all our hearts 
that we be granted peace, 
for which we all yearn. 
Bless us and our leaders 
with harmony, 
vision, 
and strength of purpose 
so that we may better fulfill our responsibilities 
to You and to our fellow man. 
Bring us nearer to You 
and thus closer to each other — 
for next to being Your children 
our greatest privilege is that we are brothers of each other.
