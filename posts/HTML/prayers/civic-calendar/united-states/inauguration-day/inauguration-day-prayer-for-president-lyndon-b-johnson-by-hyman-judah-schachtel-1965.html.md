Almighty God, 
we thank Thee for this inaugural, 
the living historic witness to our faith in Thee 
and to the choice and actions of a free people. 
Here at the Capitol of our Nation, 
the very sight of which exalts our hearts 
and awakens thrilling memories 
of the preeminent men of our resplendent past, 
we pray for Thy blessings upon our beloved President, 
the Vice President, 
and those associated with them 
in the sacred trust of leadership.

As Lyndon Baines Johnson 
and Hubert Horatio Humphrey 
each places his hand on the Bible 
to take his oath of office, 
let them know 
and let us feel 
that the hands of all of us join theirs 
in this symbolic avowal 
that Thou art supreme 
and Thy Holy Word our eternal challenge.

We ask for no miracles 
beyond the miracle which is always with us, 
if we will only use it, 
the power of love 
to transform foes into friends, 
slaves into free-men, 
the curse of war and poverty 
into the benediction of concord and plenty.

May this inauguration mark, O Lord, 
the renewal of a people unafraid of the tasks of greatness, 
a turning point in American history when we move closer 
to the realization of President Johnson’s dream 
of a better life for every citizen, 
and of uniting with all who are dedicated 
to the continuance of humanity’s immemorial, heroic journey 
toward freedom and prosperity,
justice, and peace. 
<em>Amen</em>.
