1. That mystic word of Thine, Sovereign Lord! 
Is all too pure, too high, too deep for me; 
Weary of striving, and with longing faint, 
I breathe it back again in <em>prayer</em> to Thee.[foot]This stanza is not provided in Gustav Gottheil's <em><a href="https://opensiddur.org/compilations/hymnals/hymns-and-anthems-adapted-for-jewish-worship-by-gustav-gottheil-1886/">Hymns and Anthems Adapted for Jewish Worship</a></em> (1886).[/foot]

"Abide in Me" by Harriet Beecher Stowe (1811-1896) was first published in <em><a href="https://archive.org/stream/plymouthcollecti00beec">Plymouth Collection of Hymns and Tunes; for the use of Christian Congregations</a></em> (Henry Ward Beecher, 1855), p.215. A second version with a new second stanza, the 4th stanza removed, and additional edits was published by Beecher Stowe as the poem "Abide in Me, and I in You: The Soul's Answer" in <em><a href="https://archive.org/stream/religiouspoems00stowrich#page/n39/mode/2up">Religious Poems</a></em> (1867).[foot]This second version of the poem appears two years earlier in Caroline Snowden Whitmarsh’s <em><a href="https://archive.org/details/hymnsofagesthird00whit/page/92">Hymns of the ages, Third series</a></em> (1865).[/foot] In 1886, Gustav Gottheil (1827-1903) included an abridged form of that poem, (removing the first, third, and fourth stanzas of the original hymn) in <em><a href="https://opensiddur.org/compilations/hymnals/hymns-and-anthems-adapted-for-jewish-worship-by-gustav-gottheil-1886/">Hymns and Anthems Adapted for Jewish Worship</a></em>. Finally, Gottheil's variation was reprinted in Rabbi Max D. Klein's <em><a href="https://opensiddur.org/compilations/hymnals/hymns-of-praise-and-prayer-by-max-klein-for-congregation-adath-jeshurun-philadelphia-1926/">Hymns of Praise and Prayer</a></em> (Congregation Adath Jeshurun of Philadelphia, 1926). 

I've retained the numbering of the stanzas for the hymn as it originally appears in the <em>Plymouth Collection</em> and I have enclosed the second stanza added by Beecher Stowe in [brackets]. --Aharon Varady.
