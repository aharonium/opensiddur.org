The Tribe members who were removed from Indiana would at first be removed to Kansas only to be removed again to their present location in Oklahoma. The Indiana Miami signed an 1854 treaty with the US government making us the only tribe to be recognized by the government in the State of Indiana post removal.

This indigenous land acknowledgement was adapted by Aharon Varady from <a href="/?p=30866">one compiled by Dr. Aurora Mendelsohn</a> for her Mendelsohn/Kalikow Family Haggadah (2020), itself adapted from a Land Acknowledgment offered at the Kohenet service held at the Parliament of World Religions, Toronto, November 2018. It reads, "Jews of many backgrounds have experienced a sense of geographical and cultural displacement over the years. We acknowledge our history of displacement, and as importantly, we acknowledge the ways in which we as non-indigenous peoples and settlers have benefited from colonialism, former and ongoing which has hurt and oppressed First Nations peoples. We ask for your forgiveness at this time." Territories and treaties obtained from the interactive map at <a href="https://native-land.ca">https://native-land.ca</a>, which covers Indigenous lands globally. For adapting this acknowledgement to your context, <a href="https://native-land.ca">specify your location</a>.

Dr. Mendelsohn's kavvanah observes a mitsvah or commandment of "recognizing the sovereignty of the land." I can imagine perhaps this relating to the mitsvah of <em>bal tashḥit</em> -- not laying laying waste (or being wasteful) or even the commandment in the decalogue of "honoring your mother," where the Earth is understood as our mother per Psalms 139:13-16. In my kavvanah, I situate the mitsvah first with Deuteronomy 16:20, to pursue justice, and then with the mitsvah given to Adam in Genesis 2:16, to tend to and preserve the Garden of Eden. In that tale and its midrashic expansion, Adam is created outside of the Garden, but placed inside as its caretaker. In the language of the Tanakh, all of humanity, in all of its diverse expression -- all the nations -- are <em>planted</em> in the earth -- a profound agricultural metaphor. Adam, as the first earthling, immigrant, and caretaker is given responsibility to respect and concern themselves with the well-being of this great garden. But Adam is also a metaphor for humanity as a whole, and I understand this story such that we should be preoccupied with our collective well-being in this precious biosphere, as individual human beings part of collective human groupings, and as an interdependent species sharing rich, complex and interconnected ecologies with other species. I don't want to extend the metaphor of the caretaker gardener too far for fear of its misuse. (A tidy garden with every root kept in check, every branch pruned, and every species kept within its designated plot, and all "weeds" eliminated likely appeals to the worst and most dangerous people.) I feel I'm on safe ground simply stating that the mitsvah of loving one's fellow as oneself (Leviticus 19:17-18) is implicit here, and that the Torah constantly exhorts us not to see and take, but to temper our predatory impulses and pursue, yes, pursue justice (<em>tsedeq tsedeq tirdof</em>). Might does not make right and we must always take a principled stand against land theft regardless of any claim to indigeneity, manifest destiny, or divine inheritance. The history and pattern of the abuse of indigenous peoples worldwide, is one that argues for its recognition as particularly depraved. The economic, political, and other cultural assumptions at the root of this abuse, historical and ongoing, is worthy of our sober concern and action, especially in the places where we live, so that we may possibly mitigate, correct, and support the well-being of those people's harmed in the development of those places we call our home. 

We hope this land acknowledgement will continue to be developed and improved. How can we say "we acknowledge the ways in which we, as non-indigenous people in this land, have benefited from colonialism," when these ways are not indicated? Detailing these ways is at the very least, an opportunity for an individual and group discussion, but in future iterations of the land acknowledgement, I'd like this section to be developed further. We must also not make this simply lip service -- we must think of what policies our communities need to institute to undertake actions that mitigate and reverse the harms done in alignment with the interests of indigenous peoples. --Aharon Varady
