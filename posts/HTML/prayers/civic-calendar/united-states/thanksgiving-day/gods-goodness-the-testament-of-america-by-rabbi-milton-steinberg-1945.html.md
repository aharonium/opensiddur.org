Your goodness is revealed in the <em>Testament of America</em>. 
Into this land there have assembled 
the outcast and the weary 
of the older nations of the world. 
Here they dreamed a new dream 
of a nation founded on the truth, 
"that all men are created equal, 
that they are endowed by their Creator 
with certain inalienable rights, 
that among these rights are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."[foot]Cf. the Declaration of Independence.[/foot]

And because you have been with us 
and your goodness has kept us strong, 
the freedom which they won is still ours. 
May we ever be worthy of our American heritage; 
may we ever treasure our liberties, 
not for ourselves alone but for all our fellowmen; 
and may our country become a guiding light to all mankind.

In founding the United States,

conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition 
that all men are created equal.... 
It is for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us. 
We here highly resolve that the dead shall not have died in vain,... 
That this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom,
