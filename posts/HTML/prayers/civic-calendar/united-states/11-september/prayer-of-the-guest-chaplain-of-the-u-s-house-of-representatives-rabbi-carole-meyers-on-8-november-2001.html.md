<blockquote>
<h3>One Minute Speech Given in Recognition of the Guest Chaplain:</h3>

Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I would like to join in welcoming today's distinguished guest chaplain, Rabbi Carole Meyers, and thank her for leading the House in prayer. As Rabbi Emerita of Temple Sinai in Glendale, California, Rabbi Meyers has distinguished herself as a community leader.

Over the past 15 years, Rabbi Meyers has served at Glendale's Temple Sinai, one of the most thriving synagogues in the area. During her tenure at Temple Sinai, the congregation nearly doubled in size, boosting its education programs for both children and adults.

Rabbi Meyers significantly raised the profile of the temple through her extensive community involvement. Over the past few years, Rabbi Meyers has been involved with Habitat for Humanity and the Glendale Community Foundation. She served on the Mayor's Task Force on Hate Crimes, helping to craft a citywide response plan to hate crimes. Rabbi Meyers also trained as a chaplain for the Glendale Police Department and helped to create an annual AIDS Awareness Prayer Service with other Glendale religious leaders.

Though Rabbi Meyers retired this past June in order to devote more time to her family, her influence on her community can still be felt. Today, especially in this time of national tragedy, the warmth of her words have indeed found a new meaning.

We are all proud to welcome Rabbi Meyers here today as a guest chaplain.

Upon her death, Rep Adam Schiff delivered the following remarks into the Congressional Record, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/15/extensions-of-remarks-section/article/e2127-2">Monday, October 15, 2007</a>:

<blockquote>Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, today I would like to take a moment to honor the memory of a good friend and a community leader, Rabbi Carole Meyers. Rabbi Meyers died at the age of 50 on Thursday, July 26, after a brief battle with bone cancer. She served as Rabbi of Temple Sinai in Glendale, CA, from 1986 to 2001.

Over the 15 years Rabbi Meyers served at Glendale's Temple Sinai the congregation nearly doubled in size, boosting its education programs for both children and adults.

Rabbi Meyers significantly raised the profile of the temple through her extensive work in the community. Rabbi Meyers was involved with Habitat for Humanity and the Glendale Community Foundation. She served on the Mayor's Task Force on Hate Crimes, helping to craft a citywide response plan to fight hate crimes. Rabbi Meyers also trained as a chaplain for the Glendale Police Department and helped to create an annual AIDS Awareness Prayer Service with other Glendale religious leaders.

After retiring in 2001 to spend more time with her family, Rabbi Meyers remained active in our community serving on the board of the Central Conference of American Rabbis, developing curriculum for Hebrew Union College in Los Angeles, and presiding at marriages and bar and bat mitsvahs.

In 2001, shortly after the tragic events of 9/11, Rabbi Meyers had the distinction of delivering the opening prayer in the House of Representatives. In such a sad and somber time Rabbi Meyers's prayer was uplifting and life-affirming. Her words helped console our nation. And her words that day still ring true today as we try to find answers to her untimely death.</blockquote>
