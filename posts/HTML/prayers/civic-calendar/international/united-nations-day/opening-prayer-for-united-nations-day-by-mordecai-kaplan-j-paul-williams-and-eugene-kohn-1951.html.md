We are assembled to celebrate 
the anniversary of the day in the year 1945 
when the Charter of the United Nations went into effect. 
With the adoption of that Charter, 
the first step was taken 
toward bringing all the nations of the world 
into a law-bound convenant to respect one another’s rights.

What is a nation? 
It is people who live in a land of their own, 
who live in it 
and derive their living from it; 
people bound together 
by common memories, 
by shared experiences, 
and by the ideals and aspirations 
that have grown out of those experiences.

Each nation thus possesses a character of its own. 
The national character helps mold the life 
of every man and woman in the nation 
and every man and woman adds something of his own 
to the life of the nation. 
No person is merely an individual. 
His very personality is rooted in the soil of his nation, 
reflects its landscape, 
thinks in its language, 
responds to its moral standards, laws, and customs. 
In the permanence of the nation 
his own life acquires abiding meaning; 
the resources of the nation enhance his meager powers; 
the security of the nation protects his own. 
The sovereignty of the nation 
derives from the nation’s need 
to be free to help its people obtain these blessings. 
Each nation should therefore be allowed 
to live its own life, 
to seek its own welfare, 
and to make its own contribution to civilization.

But national sovereignty must not be absolute. 
It must always be subject to the sovereignty of God, 
to whom belongs the earth and the fullness thereof.[foot]Cf. Psalms 24:1.[/foot]&nbsp; 
It must conform to His law of justice. 
When nations act arbitrarily in their own interest 
and disregard the needs and the rights of other nations, 
they usurp God’s sovereignty 
and render idolatrous obeisance to their own national ego. 
Nationalism then turns from a blessing to a curse. 
This has been the tragedy of human history 
with its record of recurrent wars 
that wreak havoc with human lives.

Aggressive nationalism has been the scourge of mankind in every age, 
but in ours it menaces the very existence of the race of man. 
Technology has shrunk the dimensions of our world 
and bound together 
in one economic mesh 
people of all races and all climes. 
We are all neighbors now 
and must learn to live together as neighbors. 
International war is an anachronism that must be abolished. 
Wars have become too destructive to be tolerated. 
Their devastation affects the lives not only of the participants 
but of whole populations, 
including millions of people who have no share in waging them. 
War has become mutual genocide. 
There is no victory in modern war, 
save for the vulture, 
the worm, 
and the disease germ.

Under such conditions 
national sovereignty can no longer mean complete national independence; 
it must mean the equality of interdependent nations. 
It calls for the union of all nations, great and small, 
to protect the rights of each and advance the good of all.

Let us look upon mankind’s plight as a challenge from God, who tells us: 
“I have set before you life and death, 
the blessing and the curse. 
Choose, therefore, life.” <span class="citation">(Deuteronomy 30:19)</span>
The decision of the nations to unite was a choice of life. 
If the nations will be loyal to the United Nations charter, 
mankind will live.

It is unclear from this publication whether the prayer was written by Mordecai Kaplan, J. Paul Williams, or Eugene Kohn separately or together in collaboration. --Aharon Varady
