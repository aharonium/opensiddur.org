God of our nation and of all nations, 
people of different races and different faiths the world over 
implore you in many tongues for the boon of peace. 
By whatever name men call you, 
and by whatever creed you are to them, 
you are the Power that has implanted in their hearts 
the yearning for justice, for love, and for peace.

We turn to you, 
ashamed of the sins that have alienated us from you
and have corrupted the world with injustice, oppression, and war. 
We repent of the idolatrous worship we have at times accorded 
to our own national being. 
We repent of the blasphemy of having invoked you name 
to sanctify acts of ungodly greed and exploitation. 
Save us from ourselves. 
Fill our minds with wisdom 
and our hearts with love, 
that we may learn to reconcile our wants 
with those of our neighbors. 
Teach us to share 
without strife 
the blessings you bestow upon us.

Give us the courage to defend the freedom of the weak 
against the strong who would enslave them. 
Grant us the patience to curb our resentments 
and to submit to arbitration the grievances we bear against our neighbors. 
Endow us with insight into the needs of other nations and peoples, 
and inspire us with the love to minister to those needs. 
Save us from bondage to those fears and passions that involve, 
in destructive and death-dealing pursuits, 
the powers which you would have us consecrate to your service 
and that of our fellow men.

Help us to build a world government 
that will command the loyalty of men and women everywhere 
by its beneficent influence on their lives. 
Speed the day when nation shall not lift up sword against nation,[foot]Cf. Isaiah 2:4; Joel 3:12; Micah 4:3.[/foot]&nbsp; 
when men shall no longer train for war, 
when the burden of armaments shall be lifted from the shoulders of men, 
and the world shall be full of that knowledge of you[foot]Cf. Habakkuk 2:14.[/foot]&nbsp;  
which will teach us how to live in harmony and love.

This closing prayer for United Nations Day was first published in <em><a href="/?p=34753">The Faith of America: Readings, Songs, and Prayers for the Celebration of American Holidays</a></em> (Jewish Reconstructionist Foundation 1951), p. 272-273. It is unclear from this publication whether the prayer was written by Mordecai Kaplan, J. Paul Williams, or Eugene Kohn separately or together in collaboration. I have replaced all archaisms in referencing the divine (Thee, Thy, Thou dost, etc.). --Aharon Varady
