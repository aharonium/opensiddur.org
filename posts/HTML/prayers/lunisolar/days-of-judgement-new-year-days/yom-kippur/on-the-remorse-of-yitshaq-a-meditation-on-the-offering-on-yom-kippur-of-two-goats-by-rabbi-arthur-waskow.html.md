Especially for those of us who use the Torah passages on the expulsion of Hagar and Ishmael and the Binding of Isaac for Rosh Hashanah, together with Rabbi Phyllis Ocean Berman, I want to recommend that you read from the Sefer Torah the passage in Genesis 25:7-11 on the reconciliation of the two brothers as they come together to bury their dangerous father Avraham/Ibrahim/Abraham.

I say “reconciliation” because the passage ends with Isaac going to live at the wellspring that saved Hagar’s and Ishmael’s lives, the one that Hagar named Be’er Laḥai Ro’i, Well of the Living-One Who-Sees-Me. This is the passage, from Everett Fox’s translation in <em>The Five Books of Moses</em> (Schocken, 1995):

A hundred years and seventy years and five years, then he expired.

It seems to us that the point of Yom Kippur is to make tshuvah and tiqqun from misdeeds of our lives. The reconciliation of the two brothers may be an example that should be lifted up for Yom Kippur, and treated with the importance of a formal Torah reading on that day.

That is <em>pshat</em>.[foot]The explicit meaning.[/foot] On a more midrashic level, we might say that the ritual of the two goats echoes the dangers faced by the two brothers – one goat offered up precisely where tradition says Isaac was bound, almost to be offered; and the other goat is sent away into the wilderness, as Ishmael was. We might see this as “We do not do this to humans any more -- God forbid, God forbade! -- only to goats.”  And then this becomes only a story-telling, not a physical act even toward goats -- as if to say, “We don’t do this to animals, either: we only tell the story.”

But perhaps then we have grown enough in our awareness to say, “But even that is not enough. At this time of year we must lift up a positive act of peace-making, and let it find its way into our hearts and even our hands, as we seek to lift up a truer end of the story to affect ourselves in our own generation.”
