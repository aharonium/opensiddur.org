This world of ours - 
this world of Yours, really - 
seems ever-determined upon its own defeat. 
Needless anger and persistent belligerence fill our vulnerable air. 
The world around us can be so very, very loud. 
So we seek solace and quiet within this sanctuary in time. Quiet. 
A bit of peace, even.

God, 
during these days of heightened wonder 
when we express our ache for the blessing of a New Year, 
touch our own wounded hearts 
and cast away the crumbs of egotism. 
In other words, Beloved God, 
we pause, reflect acknowledge, and return again to our best selves.

Yes, Source of Life, 
this moment is one of return. 
We return to the world, 
to ancient promises 
of life and safety, 
of justice and mercy. 
Yes, God, 
we are here, weary, 
hearts in trembling hands.

We wish to be with You, Holy One, 
to feel Your Grace once again, 
to taste the Hope that is Your very Breath, 
to cry freely, 
to feel deeply loved, 
to break free of the obstacles that have been placed in our ways, 
some by our own hands. 
We are so very powerful 
we can sometimes ourselves be the stumbling blocks 
we so desperately seek to overcome. 
Today we observe ourselves, 
acknowledge our power 
to clear the paths ahead, 
to find peace, inner and beyond.

In this moment,

as it was meant to be, 
as You dreamt it to be.

God, 
as we sway and feel,

one way we can bring our broken open-eyed-world 
one step close to the beauty we sense when we close our eyes.
