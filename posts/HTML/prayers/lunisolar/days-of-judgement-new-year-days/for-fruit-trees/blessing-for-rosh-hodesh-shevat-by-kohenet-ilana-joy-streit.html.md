the sap
is considering rising
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the snow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is considering falling

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and here we are
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;between the two

may the rising sap
&nbsp;&nbsp;be woven into us
may it enter
&nbsp;&nbsp;our bloodstream

may the light from the sun
&nbsp;&nbsp;reflected off of bare branches
enter into our eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and from our eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to our visions and prayers
&nbsp;&nbsp;and then to vibrant waters
and a peaceful Jerusalem

may we be the trees
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that we have been waiting for

may it be a month
&nbsp;&nbsp;of rising and falling
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and being held and beheld
&nbsp;&nbsp;touching the roots of our sorrow
blessing the roots of our redemption

may we be the trees
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that we have been waiting for

may the Third Temple
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be an altar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of words and grieving and joyful dancing
at town squares everywhere
