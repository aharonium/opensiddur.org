1) In the time that the Holy One created the first human, he took him to all the trees of Gan Eden and said to him, ‘See my works, how lovely and praiseworthy they are, and all I created, for your sake I created it. Put your mind [to this], that you don’t ruin or destroy my world, for if you ruin there is no one who will repair after you.” (<em>Ecclesiastes Rabbah</em> on Ecclesiastes 7:13 “See the work of God!

<h3>Prayer of Reb Nachman of Bratslav</h3>
רבונו של עולם
Master of the Universe,
grant me the ability to be alone;
may it be my custom to go outdoors each day
among the trees and grass,
among all growing things
and there may I be alone,
and enter into התבודדות prayer,
to talk with the One to whom I belong.
May I express there everything in my heart,
and may all the foliage of the field —
all grasses, trees, and plants —
awake at my coming,
to send the powers of their life
into the words of my prayer
so that my prayer and speech are made whole
through the life and spirit of all growing things,
which are made as one by their transcendent Source.
May I then pour out the words of my heart
before your Presence like water, O Lord,
and lift up my hands to You in worship,
on my behalf, and that of my children!
(Adapted from R’ Natan, <a href="https://opensiddur.org/2011/09/likutei-tefillot-and-the-open-breslov-project/">Tefillah 11 (Ot 224) from Likutei Tefillot v.2</a>)

<h3>Fruits of the Four Worlds</h3>

“I went down to the nut garden…” With the walnut/egoz, you take one from the pile, and all of them scatter and roll, one after the other. So too with Israel: strike one of them, and all of them feel it. (<em>Song of Songs Rabbah</em> 6:11)

Likewise, when a single species is endangered, the entire ecosystem is shaken and affected.

“And the dove came in [to the ark] at evening, and here, an olive leaf torn off in her mouth.” (Gen. 8:9) From where did she bring it? R’ Bibi said: The gates of Gan Eden גן עדן were opened for her. R’ Abahu said: If she came from the garden of Eden, wouldn’t she bring something special, cinnamon or balsam? But she hinted to Noah: Better is bitterness from this and not sweetness from beneath your hand. (<em>Genesis Rabbah</em> 33:6)

With a fig-tree, whenever one searches her, one finds [ripe] figs in her [because they don’t ripen at once, but some each day]. So too with words of Torah: whenever a person meditates upon them, he finds [new] meaning/ta`am טעם taste. (<em>Talmud Bavli Eruvin</em> 54a-b)

A person has a head and so does the earth, as it’s said, “and the head of the dirt/<em>`afar</em> of the world” (Prov. 8:26)…Just as the woman gives birth so does the land, as it’s said, “Has the earth labored for a single day, even birthing a nation in a moment?” (<em>Kohelet Rabbah</em> to Ecclesiastes 1:4)

15) The Human is the Universe is the Cosmic Tree

Kabbalah teaches that the universe exists as the Cosmic image of a human being (called <em>Adam Kadmon</em> אדם קדמון). The universe is also the image of a tree, with roots in the emanation of divine blessing in God, the trunk as the manifestation of creation out of nothingness, branches as the unfolding and weaving of diversity in creation, leaves as the transformations of each life, and fruit as the souls of all living things, especially human beings. This means that universe and the tree are images of God. Also, like the Cosmic Tree, trees tie together heaven and earth (humans do as well), while fruit trees in particular give of themselves freely. These are all reasons why fruit trees, like humans, are seen as an image of God.

<h3>ACTION</h3>
Every Tu biShvat seder should include some action or practical work for trees and the earth. Find out what fits your local community. If you want to help Israel, look up the Good Energy Initiative, created by the Heschel Center for the Environment. Are you already recycling? Bicycling? Composting? What can you do next? What sustainable community initiatives exist where you live? What makes it hard to do more, and what inspires you to do more? What kind of world do you want to live in? Before you complete the <em>seder</em>, arrive at one resolution that you can do that will bring us closer to that vision.

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">O God, who makes, forms, creates, and emanates the highest worlds! You made the trees and grasses grow from the ground in the shape and pattern of these highest worlds. And this full moon is the beginning of Your work to renew and ripen the fruit trees, to bring forth the fruit of ‘the Tree of Life in the midst of the garden’. May it be Your will that our eating and blessing and meditating on these fruits will strengthen the flow of love and blessing over the trees, to make them grow and bloom, for good life, for blessing and for peace. May all Creation return to its original strength and may we see the rainbow rejoicing in its colors. And may all the sparks of divine energy, whether scattered by our hands, or by the hands of our ancestors, or by the sin of the first human against the fruit of the tree, be returned and included in the majestic might of the Tree of Life.</p>

17) Pardes I

Four entered the orchard/<em>pardes</em> פרדס (Paradise)— Ben Azai, Ben Zoma, Acher and Rabbi Akiva. Ben Azai looked and died. Ben Zoma looked and lost his mind. Acher cut off the saplings. R’ Akiva entered in peace and came out in peace. (<em>Talmud Bavli Chagigah</em> 14)

Commentary: Ben Azai saw things at the level of <em>p’shat</em> פ – he couldn’t contain the mystery. Acher saw things at the level of <em>remez</em> ר – everything had to make sense for him to believe. Ben Zoma saw things at the level of <em>sōd</em> ס – once he entered he never left. Akiva could move between the levels, drinking from all of them and from their source. This is the level of <em>drash</em> ד, the level of mythos, psyche, the dream-soul.

20) Pardes II: Don’t Detach the Fruit from the Tree !

The 4 letters of the word <em>pardes</em>—PRDS פרדס —stand for the 4 ways of interpreting Torah. These are <em>P’shat</em> פשט –literal interpretation, Remez רמז –allusion and parable, <em>D’rash</em> דרש – exegesis, and Sōd סוד – mystical inter-pretation. If we remove Sōd, we are left with PRD פרד , the root of <em>nifrad</em> נפרד , which means “separate” or “detached.” Torah without <em>Sōd</em>, its mystical dimension, is like a fruit separated from the Tree.

25) The Radiance of the Earth—Returning Light

The essence and nature of the light of the infinite/<em>Eyn Sof</em> אין סוף …encompasses all worlds equally [as it says]: “And I fill the heavens and the earth ארץ ,” and “There is no place void of Him”—even in this physical world…[But] this radiance manifests its power and ability in the element of the physical earth/<em>`afar</em> עפר in an immense manifestation, in more enormous strength than the elements transcending it [water, air and fire,] even more than the hosts of heaven. For they do not have the power to bring forth something from nothing, like the element of earth—these are the plants and trees—from the power it possesses, which is אין <em>Ayin</em>/no-thing and spiritual. This is the constant and everlasting effect, throughout the earth, of the command “Let the earth bring forth plants”, and not only during the six days of creation. For during the seven days of the beginning there shone in this world a radiance from the light of the <em>Eyn Sof</em> in pure kindness <em>Ḥesed chinam</em>, making plants and trees and fruits grow from nothing to something, constantly from year to year. This is called <em>Or Ḥozer</em>, from below, where there is revealed in enormous strength the light of Eyn Sof that surrounds all worlds.

<h3>The Tree of Life</h3>
“The kabbalists refer to the extension of the worlds as a tree.

<h3>Kabbalistic anagrams and gematriot (hard!)</h3>
26) YHVH = Shekhinah = the Tree of Life

"This one, your body, was like a date palm..." (Song of Songs 7:8)

Commentary: [What does this verse teach us about the Holy One?] It means that one who knows the measure of the body of [this date palm] inherits the coming world. For this date palm is the letter Vav ו [of God’s name – because ו is a straight line, like a trunk]. About Him it says, “YHVH is the purifying pool of Israel/<em>miqveh yisrael</em>”. <em>Miqveh</em> מקוה is her <em>qomah</em> קומה which is Her (<em>Shekhinah</em>’s) measure. [Because date palms require male and female trees to make fruit.] This is [why] it says, “The Righteous One like a date palm will blossom.” (Psalms 92:13) <em>Tiquney Zohar</em> 146a 27) The Name YHVH is alluded to in the word tree/<em>`eits</em>…How so? [Y × H + H × Y = 100, V × H + H × V = 60 = 160], thus the total is the value of <em>`eits</em> [Ayin + Ts = 70+90 = 160]. And beloved is the human being, who was created <em>b’tselem</em>/in God’s image, which has the same value, [Ts+L+M = 90+30+40 = 160]. (from <em>Generations of Man</em>, Isaiah Horowitz (the Shla”h), 111-112)

<em>Ilan</em>/tree equals 91, which is YHVH (26) + Adonai (65).

<h3>Ending the <em>Seder</em></h3>
<h4>Redemption</h4>
28) [In the future, the Holy One] is destined to make the face of the heavens new, like the face of the sun, and the face of the earth new like the face of the moon, and the face of the fruit trees like the face of the stars, and the face of the fruits of the fruits of the ground like the face of the constellations, and make sweet their scent like the scent of Gan Eden…Each and every tree is destined to put forth fruit in the time-to-come, as it’s said, “And the land will give her produce and the tree of the field will give his fruit.” (<em>Midrash Alpha Beta, Batey Midrashot,</em> 430)
