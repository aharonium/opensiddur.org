I feel the Presence
Of what today I call God
Tomorrow I may call nature--
The Fierce Mystery
All around us,
This connection that must know everything because it is everything.

We buy slabs of meat in transparent packages that don't look like you
So we don't have to think about how you were raised and slaughtered.
You are a breast or a leg or a steak,
You are a hamburger, a wing or a bucket.
We tool and dye your skin and call it leather
So we don't have to acknowledge we're wearing your skin.
We arrange your feathers artfully
And admire the beautiful colors,
Ignoring why you have them in the first place.
We put your feathers in our pillows
And we sleep well.

You domestic beasts are all vegetarians, why is that?
Why don't we eat predators?
Is it because you are docile and easy to domesticate?
Or is it because predators remind us of ourselves?

I do.

I wear leather. I'm wearing it on my feet right now.
My pillow is filled with down. I slept okay.
I know all about how you suffer and still I partake of it all.
I don't eat veal. That's it. Not much.
I think about helping you.
But i don't.
So I can't ask for forgiveness

We can eat less meat.
We can wear less leather.
We can refuse to wear real fur.
We can refuse to eat veal.
We can only buy grass fed and pasture raised poultry and meat, if we can afford it.
We can stop wearing feathers.
We can use alternative down feather pillows, though that's plastic and not so good for the environment.

Blessed Yah,
Breath of Life,
Remembering us in Death,
The Fierce Mystery:
We acknowledge, celebrate, and give thanks for all the ways the animals have made our lives possible.
We confess to cruelty and hypocrisy.
We ask your forgiveness for all the wrongs we have done our domestic beasts,
We are blessed by their lives.
May we learn to be a blessing to them.
And we wish them a Happy New Year and a Ḥodesh Tov
