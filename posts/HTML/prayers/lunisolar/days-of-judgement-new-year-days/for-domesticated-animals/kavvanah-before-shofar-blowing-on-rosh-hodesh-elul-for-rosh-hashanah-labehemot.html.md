For a sourcesheet on Rosh ha-Shanah la-Behemah, find Aharon Varady's compilation of texts, <a href="https://www.sefaria.org/sheets/184964?lang=bi">here</a>.

The text of this ritual shofar blowing for Rosh Ḥodesh Elul on Rosh haShanah La-Behemah developed as part of the annual ceremony taking place at the dairy barn on the campus of the Isabella Freedman Jewish Retreat Center beginning in 2009 under the auspices of Elat Chayyim Center for Jewish Spirituality and the Adamah Farm & Fellowship. The first Rosh haShanah ritual ceremony was co-developed by Rabbi Jill Hammer and Kohenet Sarah Chandler. My contribution of the kavvanah came a year later in 2010. The text presented here was built upon that ceremony and was presented first at the Hazon Detroit Jewish Food Festival in 2016.

In rabbinic Judaism, the law of <em>tsaar baalei ḥayyim</em> obligating concern and fulfillment of the basic needs of non-human animals so as not to cause them harm is derived from Deuteronomy 11:13-15.[foot]Berakhot 40a. Rav Yehuda taught in the name of Rav: "It is forbidden for a person to eat before he gives food to his animal as it says (Deuteronomy 11:15) 'I will provide grass in your field for your <em>behemah</em>' and only then does the verse state “and you will eat and be satisfied.” Also find, Genesis 9:4, as interpreted in the Talmud (<em>Sanhedrin</em> 59a). Many thanks to Sharona Margolin Halickman for <a href="https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/the-animals-eat-first/">her teaching</a> on <em>tsaar baalei ḥayyim</em>.[/foot] Compassion for animals is declared to have been the merit of Moshe which made him the <em>shepherd</em> of his people (<em>Exodus Rabbah</em> 2), while Yehudah ha-Nasi saw in his own ailment the punishment for having once failed to show compassion for a frightened calf (<em>Bava Metzia</em> 85a). The <em>aggadic</em> (mythic) tradition concerned with the origin of predatory nature in <em>Olam Hazeh</em> (this world) can be found in the Jewish deutero-canonical works of <em>Sefer Ḥanokh</em> (1 Enoch) and <em>Sefer Yubalim</em> (Jubilees) as well as in<em> Midrash Abkir</em> and the collection of rabbinic midrash and midrash aggadah, <em>Yalkut Shimoni</em>.[foot]In Sefer haYovelim (circa 3rd century BCE), the need for circumscribing the predatory nature of humankind after the <em>Dor Hamabul</em> (depraved generation of the Flood) is given as the <em>raison d'etre</em> for the giving of the Torah. As required by the covenant of the Rainbow made to Noaḥ and his descendants after the flood, a representative people was needed who might abide by the general commandment of <em>ever min haḥai</em> (forbidding eating living creatures). In this tradition, Avraham was the first to prove worthy since his actions epitomized <em>ḥesed</em>, lovingkindness (an innovation in Judaism's mytho-historic chronicle of humanity in Genesis). As noted in Rav Shlomo Kluger's HaElef L’cha Shlomo in Yoreh Deah 322, dairy foods, the product of living creatures, were prohibited after the Flood, but this prohibition was relaxed upon the giving of the Torah at Sinai just as the prohibition against eating flesh was relaxed after the covenant at Ararat. For this reason, dairy is a symbolic food eaten on the festival of Shavuot (Pentecost) and remains a symbolic food representing the subversion of predatory nature as reflected in Megillat Yehudith and the dairy food traditions of the festival of Ḥanukkah.

For the Leader. [A Psalm] of David the servant of YHVH.

Transgression speaks to the wicked, methinks—
There is no fear of God before their eyes.

For it flatters them in their eyes,
Until their iniquity is found, and they be hated.

The words of their mouth are iniquity and deceit;
They have left off to be wise, to do good.

They devise iniquity upon their bed;
They set themselves in a way that is not good;
They abhor not evil.

Your lovingkindness, YHVH, is in the heavens;
Your faithfulness reaches unto the skies.

Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains;
Your judgments are like the great deep;
<strong>Human (<em>adam</em>) and domesticated animal (<em>behemah</em>) you preserve, YHVH.</strong>

How precious is your lovingkindness, <em>Elohim</em>!
And the children of <em>Adam</em>
take refuge in the shadow of your wings.

They are abundantly satisfied with the fatness of your house;
And you make them drink of the river of your pleasures.

For with you is the fountain of life;
In your light do we see light.

O continue your lovingkindness unto them that know you;
And your righteousness to the upright in heart.

Let not the foot of pride overtake me,
And let not the hand of the wicked drive me away.

There are the workers of iniquity fallen;
They are thrust down, and are not able to rise.

For the Leader. A Psalm. A Song of David. 

Praise waits for you, Elohim, in Tsiyon; 
and unto you the vow is performed. 

You who hears prayer; unto you does all flesh come. 

The tale of iniquities is too heavy for me; 
as for our transgressions, you will pardon them. 

Happy is the one whom you choose and bring near, that they may dwell in your courts; 
may we be satisfied with the goodness of your house, the holy place of your temple! 

With wondrous works do you answer us in righteousness, elo'ah of our salvation; 
You are the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of the far distant seas; 

Who by your strength sets fast the mountains, who are girded about with might; 

Who stills the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves, and the tumult of the peoples; 

So that they that dwell in the uttermost parts stand in awe of your signs; 
You make the outgoings of the morning and evening rejoice. 

You have remembered the earth, and watered her, 
greatly enriching her, with the river of Elohim that is full of water; 
You prepare them corn, for so prepare you her. 

Watering her ridges abundantly, settling down the furrows thereof, 
You makest her soft with showers; 
You bless the growth thereof. 

You crown the year with your goodness; 
and your paths drop fatness. 

The pastures of the wilderness do drop; 
and the hills are girded with joy. 

The meadows are clothed with flocks; 
the valleys also are covered over with corn; 
they shout for joy, yea, they sing.
