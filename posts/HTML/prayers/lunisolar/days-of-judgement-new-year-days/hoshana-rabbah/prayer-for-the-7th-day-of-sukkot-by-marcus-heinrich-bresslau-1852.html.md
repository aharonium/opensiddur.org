O Lord, abundant in goodness and truth! 
Animated with pious reflections, 
urged by Thy commandment to celebrate this Festival, 
I venture to approach Thee this day 
which according to custom in Israel 
is distinguished by sacred observances 
tending to impress us 
with our nothingness and our humbleness, 
like unto the willow of the brook, 
a symbol of plaintiveness, tears, and suffering. 
For what is our life, 
what is our strength, 
and what is our virtue?

We ourselves have as little merit as that willow of the brook, 
which has neither taste, nor flavour, nor fragrance. 
Be it then a token of deep humility, 
to guard us against over-rating our powers, 
and over-valuing our merits. 
Be this willow a warning to us 
not to grow over-bearing and haughty in prosperity, 
not to become proud and vain in affluence; 
not to boast of our piety, 
not to land ourselves for our religious observances; 
nor to be intoxicated with joy during these Festivals, 
but to allow the injunction of the Psalmist, 
“serve the Lord in fear and rejoice in trembling.” <span class="citation">(Psalms 2:11)</span>

Grant, therefore, O Lord, 
that our attention during our Service 
may not be distracted by worldly affairs, 
that our devotions may not be disturbed, 
that our mind be not divided 
between the worship of Thee 
and that of worldly matters.

we may tremble also at the punishment which awaits us, 
if we abuse Thy kindness and forbearance.

Strengthen us, Omnipotent Father, 
to combine this joy and fear, 
so that we may not be haughty in prosperity, 
nor faint-hearted in adversity. 
But that we may be able to attain the golden medium, 
in order to walk straightly and uprightly in Thy ways 
towards the goal of life, 
so that we may merit the blessing of again celebrating this Festival 
with that joy and praise to Thee 
as our ancestors did in the times of Thy glorious Temple 
in Thy holy City. 
<em>Amen</em>.
