This, O Lord! 
according to the holy legend, 
is the apple of paradise, 
which entailed on man salvation and misery. 
Through the enjoyment of this fruit, 
as revealed in Holy Writ, 
light and reason became the properties of the spirit, 
but the germ of destruction was, through it, 
also implanted in the body.

Let me remember, Eternal God! 
that we the frail daughters of Eve, 
are likewise subject to the temptings of the serpent, sin; 
and that we must, with all care and diligence, 
guard our hearts from the venom of its sting. 
Grant us strength and power of will, 
to withstand courageously each temptation in life 
which leads to error; 
and do Thou ward off from us 
every allurement of the senses 
which might effect the destruction of our better nature. 
For every fruit, seducing vice holds forth to us, 
entails upon us banishment from Paradise, 
and closes against us the Eden of innocence, 
where with flaming sword, 
the angel keep his constant guard, 
that the sinner may never more obtain admission. 
Alas! sin once admitted, 
is sure to extend its baleful influence over the heart: 
the soul once stained with vice, 
never regains below its heavenly brightness.

'Tis therefore, Father! 
that we every day implore Thee, 
not to lead us in the power of temptation; 
but to remove from us the snares of evil, 
so that our wavering footsteps may not stumble.

As an admonitory recollection, Lord! 
I taste the stalk[foot]By stalk, Miriam Wertheimer and Wolfgang Wessely here are referring to the <em>pithom</em> of the Etrog. This prayer serves as a kavvanah for the ritual custom of a pregnant woman biting off the pithom of the etrog.[/foot] of this beautiful fruit, 
so that its bitterness may keep alive the salutary reflection, 
that the result of sin, however sightly, 
is bitter to the mind and heart; 
and that it is only folly which permits itself 
to be enticed by the false allurements of the tempter. 
Therefore, Heavenly Father! 
do Thou hear my prayer, as I supplicate Thee 
in the words of the holy Psalmist, 
"Create in me a pure heart, 
and renew within me an upright spirit, 
Eternal, my Rock and my Redeemer!" <span class="citation">(Psalms 51:10)</span> 
<em>Amen</em>.

We have transcribed her translation as it was published in <em><a href="/?p=41448">Devotional Exercises for the Use of Jewish Women on Public and Domestic Occasions</a></em> (1852), pp. 48-49. I have not been able to locate a copy of the original work from which this translation was derived.
