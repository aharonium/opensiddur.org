We are the generation that stands 
between the fires:
Behind us the flame and smoke
that rose from Auschwitz and from Hiroshima;
From the burning forests of the Amazon,
From the hottest years of human history
that bring upon us
Melted ice fields, Flooded cities, Scorching droughts.
Before us the nightmare of a Flood of Fire,
The heat and smoke that could consume all Earth.

"Here! The day is coming
That will flame like a furnace, “
Says the Infinite YHWH / Yahhhh,
The Breath of Life --
when all the arrogant, all evil-doers,
root and branch,
will like straw be burnt to ashes.
Yet for those of you who revere My Name,
Yes! My Name, Yahhhh, the Interbreath of Life!
a sun of justice will arise
with healing in its wings / rays. . . .

<hr />
"Between the Fires: A Prayer for lighting Candles of Commitment" was composed by Rabbi Arthur Waskow, drawing on traditional midrash about the danger of a Flood of Fire, and the passage from Malachi. Rabbi David Seidenberg (neohasid.org) was inspired to compose a prayer based on this on this one for the ten day period between the day of the flood (ל״ב בעומר) and the day of the rainbow (מ״ב בעומר) during the Sefirat HaOmer, <a href="https://opensiddur.org/prayers/special-days/sefirat-haomer/prayer-between-the-fires-by-rabbi-david-seidenberg-neohasid-org/">A prayer between the Fires (between the 32nd and the 42nd day of the Omer)</a>.
