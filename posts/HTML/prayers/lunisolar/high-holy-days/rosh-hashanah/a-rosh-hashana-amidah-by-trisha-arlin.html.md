God of my childhood faith, of my adult skepticism
God of the mystics, of the philosophers
God of our ancestors, of our children
God of this community, and of mine, only
God who knew my parents, God who knows my death

<strong>PRAISE GOD’S POWER</strong>
God of my strength and of my weakness,
God of my current understanding and my lack thereof,
Incline your metaphorical ear
And open your metaphorical eye.
Rambam says, 
If you can’t imagine God then you don’t exist.
There is no thing that is not God.
God is no thing.
Wow.
<strong>Blessed be God, bringing us the Wow.</strong>

<strong>DECLARE YOURSELF</strong>
Because the truly evil are already condemned
The truly good are already blessed
And then, there’s the rest of us.
It is said that on Rosh Hashanah God decides your fate: life or death.
And the ten days until Yom Kippur are your opportunity to change God’s mind.
So don’t blow it.
This is a powerful day, a fantastic opportunity!
Declare yourself for holiness and joy and truth.
<strong>Bless <em>Shechina</em>, seeing how hard we are trying.</strong>

And let us declare together:
We understand nothing.
All that is physical, ends.
We die.
But not today.
Except sometimes, today.
We fret about the past and worry about the future
And forget to live with where we are now.
And then we die.
We understand nothing.

<em>Tzedukah</em>, when we transcend self;
And that’s when God decrees.
<strong>Bless the Presence, remembering when we have forgotten.</strong>

Life can be so good, can’t it?

Who cares which book we’re inscribed in?
This moment is so great.
I am so thankful for the beautiful weather, 
the glorious music, the fine words, 
the sweet meals, the warm home,
the good friends, the silly toys
the sexual pleasures, the profound thoughts,
the crazy family, the big laughs,
and the loving.
