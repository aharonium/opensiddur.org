<em>We have sinned</em>
By yielding to confusion and falling into passivity
By indulging in fear
By giving in to anger
By not standing up for ourselves
By thinking about Jewish values only on holy days
By tolerating global warming, global disease and global poverty
By being cynical about repairing the world
By not defending Israel
By not defending Palestine

By not standing up to fanaticism, terrorism, rape and torture – no matter who the perpetrators are
By not rocking the boat
By not being grateful for our blessings
By not loving enough
By being indifferent to the rich getting richer and the poor staying miserable
By allowing greed, in others and in ourselves, to go unchecked
By not opposing laws that promise false security and deprive us of our freedoms and civil liberties
By not opposing ballot measures that deprive us of basic rights

By building fences on our borders

By not making the most of the limited time we have
By speaking <em>loshen hara</em>[foot]Misrepresenting, harmful speech[/foot]
By forgetting how to smile
