You are a hamburger, a wing or a bucket.
We tool and dye your skin and call it leather
So we don't have to acknowledge we're wearing your skin.
We arrange your feathers artfully
And admire the beautiful colors,
Ignoring why you have them in the first place.
We put your feathers in our pillows
And we sleep well.

You domestic beasts are all vegetarians, why is that?
Why don't we eat predators?
Is it because you are docile and easy to domesticate?

I do.

I love eggs, honey, yogurt, chicken, steak.
I wear leather. I'm wearing it on my feet right now.
My pillow is filled with down. I slept okay.
I know all about how you suffer and still I partake of it all.
I don't eat veal. That's it. Not much.
I think about helping you.
But i don't.
So I can't ask for forgiveness
because I'm not going to change.
This month, anyway.

We can eat less meat.
We can wear less leather.
We can refuse to wear real fur.
We can refuse to eat veal.
We can only buy grass fed and pasture raised poultry and meat, if we can afford it.
We can stop wearing feathers.
We can use alternative down feather pillows, though that's plastic and not so good for the environment.

We confess to cruelty and hypocrisy.
