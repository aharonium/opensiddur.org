We raise this branch in sorrow because each and every year, olive trees, the source of livelihood for Palestinian families, are intentionally chopped down, burned and uprooted.  In attempting to exercise their right to work their lands, farmers repeatedly put themselves in danger. Both the human being and the trees of the field are desecrated, and there is no earthly law or judge (<em>ein din v’ein dayan</em>). Only a few are guilty, but all are responsible.[foot]Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel.[/foot]
