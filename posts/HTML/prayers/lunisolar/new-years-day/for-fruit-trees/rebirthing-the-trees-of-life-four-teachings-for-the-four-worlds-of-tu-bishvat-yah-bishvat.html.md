The four teachings below are connected with the Four Worlds that the kabbalists saw as the architecture of the universe. When the Kabbalistic community of Tz'fat created the Seder for Tu BiShvat/Yah BiShvat, they unfolded these Four Worlds in four cups of wine and four sorts of fruit and nuts (one sort so ethereal it was invisible and untouchable).

The Tu BiShvat seder itself is the one ceremonial meal that requires the death of no living creature. Trees give us nuts &amp; fruit in such profusion that we can eat and eat without endangering the next generation. Even the Pesaḥ bitter herb requires yanking a radish up by the root. So the Tu BiShvat Seder is the meal of Gan Eden, the Garden of Delight.

The mixture of red wine and white in the four successive cups of the Seder is often described as a procession of the seasons, from white winter to the full red of autumn. It may also be an echo of the Rabbinic and Kabbalistic teaching that it is the mixture of blood (red) and semen (white) that makes the future fruitful.

In the year 2000, for Tu BiShvat 300 Jews and people of other cultures and communities gathered in the redwood forests of northern California to challenge a corporation that was logging ancient redwoods, shattering the grandeur of groves that had been growing 1500 years and more that were growing when Shammai and Hillel first debated the date of the new year of the trees.

At the end of the Seder, we planned to walk onto ground that Maxxam Corporation had shattered in this way, and to plant redwood seedlings as an act of protest. Nonviolent civil disobedience. And we did. Though the company's police were ready to arrest us, they pulled back at the last moment.

But first we sat nearby in a grove of ancient trees to share the Seder. Above us towered trees that were more than 200 feet tall — the tallest living beings on the planet. Suddenly my friend, student, co-editor, and teacher (now Rabbi) Naomi Mara Hyman turned to me and said, "Imagine if those 200-foot-tall <em>eytzim</em> (trees) were the eytzim (wooden poles) of a Sefer Torah! — What a Sefer Torah it would be, how large, not only physically but in the spirit! And we ourselves, we would each be just the right size to be a letter in that Sefer Torah!"

And in the Sefer Torah, no letter stands alone. In Hebrew there is no word that can be written with a single letter. Not even "I" or "a," as in English. We appear in clusters to make words, verses, books. We live and breathe together.

The energy has nowhere to go, to flow. It flames up in a single narrow place, so that the sacred energy and light first scorches the single letter and then from that scorched place turns the entire Scroll, the entire Earth, into a furious furnace. The sacred Sefer Torah burns to ashes.

Rabbi Phyllis Ocean Berman teaches:

When we count in Hebrew, we say that the letter <span class="liturgy-inline">י</span> (Yod) is 10, <span class="liturgy-inline">י״א</span> (Yod-aleph) is 11, <span class="liturgy-inline">י״בּ</span> (Yod-bet) is 12, and so on. But when we come to 15, which should read as <span class="liturgy-inline">י״ה</span> (Yod-hei), we stop. For Yod-Hei, <span class="liturgy-inline">יָהּ</span> (Yah), is one of the Names of God as in <span class="liturgy-inline">הַלְלוּ־יָהּ</span> (Hallelu-YAH), "Let us praise YAH" and we have been afraid to connect the Name of God with the sacred time of the fullness of the moon and the rebirthing of the trees.

This year [2013], the full moon of Shvat will fall on Shabbat Shira itself, January 24-25. In your own Seder, feel free to integrate the four teachings by reading each passage in its “world.” If you do, please credit The Shalom Center, referring to a treasury of teaching about this festival at <a  href="https://theshalomcenter.org/treasury/118" >https://theshalomcenter.org/treasury/118</a>. Thanks!

Shalom, Arthur
