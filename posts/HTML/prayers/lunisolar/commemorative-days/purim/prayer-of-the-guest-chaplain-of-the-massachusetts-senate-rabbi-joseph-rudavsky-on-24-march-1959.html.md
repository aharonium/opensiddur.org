Today is Purim, festival of joy, 
gladness dedicated to the proposition 
that the Hamans of all ages—
men, 
merchants of prejudice, 
purveyors of hatred—
may yet learn the truth "that to bigotry there can be no sanction."[foot]George Washington’s <a href="https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/05-06-02-0135">Letter to the Jews of Newport, Rhode Island</a> (1790)[/foot]
Purim, festival of religious equality, 
commemorating the right of worship. 
The privilege to stand stalwart, 
consistent with one's faith and belief.

On Purim we pray to thee, 
O God, creator of all, 
to implant in humanity 
the qualities of love and understanding, 
of courage and wisdom, 
of patience and humility. 
As we are grateful to Thee 
for people of prophetic stamp, 
so do we pray to Thee, 
for our leaders, 
who serve to inculcate these ideals in the people.

O God of our fathers,
bless us 
and shield our leaders with wisdom and fortitude, 
that they may lead the people in righteousness. 
Enable our legislators to make of our land, 
a land of justice and goodness for all. 
Help them to organize our life 
for a better day. 
Strengthen their hands 
and bless them with consecrated hearts 
to serve our people with devotion and dedication, 
that our land, 
the land of the brave, 
may ever be the home of the free, 
its beacon shining, 
a guiding light to those yet struggling 
in darkness and oppression, 
yearning for the light. 
May their inspiration ever be peace, 
and their lodestar ever be justice 
for all mankind.
