According to the Ḥasidic Master and Kabbalist, R' Levi Yitzchak of Berditchev (1740 – 1810), a key theme of Ḥanukkah is vision, and the festival offers us an important opportunity to work with and heal our sense of sight (see <em>Kedushat Levi</em>, Ḥanukkah 2:2).

The candles of Ḥanukkah provide an optimal object for visual meditation. As taught in the passages below, we are invited to gaze into their flames and to see the light of infinite potential. Our ancient tradition teaches that this light, the <em>Or HaGanuz</em>, is the hidden light of creation, consciousness, healing and redemption (see Genesis Rabbah 11:2, Niddah 30b and Ḥagigah 12a).

The Ḥasidic Master and Kabbalist, R' Tzvi Elimelech Spira of Dinov (1783 – 1841) often draws upon earlier mystical teachings in his classic work Bnei Yissascher. In the teaching below, he writes that Ḥanukkah is an opportunity to train ourselves to see and appreciate as much as of this light as we are able.[foot]See R' Tsvi Elimelech Spira of Dinov's <a href="https://opensiddur.org/prayers/lunisolar/commemorative-days/hanukkah/kavvanah-for-the-mitsvah-of-kindling-the-hanukkah-lights-by-rebbe-tsvi-elimelech-spira-of-dinov/">kavvanah for kindling the Ḥanukkah lights</a>. --Aharon Varady[/foot]

As we light and gaze at one more candle each day, we increase our capacity to see, appreciate and channel its infinite goodness, hope and creativity.

Gazing at the candles themselves is a profound practice, but they are not essential for us to do this work. The practice instructions below offer guidance for how to visualize this light in our mind's eye. In the <u><a href="https://www.appliedjewishspirituality.org/kabbalah-through-the-calendar">Kabbalah Through the Calendar</a></u> course we explore this subject in depth.
