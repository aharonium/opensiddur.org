An interpretive version of Al HaNisim for Ḥanukkah that is playful, powerful, and embodied. May it fuel our activism, including the self-care and community-building that is part of activism.

The Hebrew word for miracle, <em>ness</em>, also means banner: a miracle is a banner that announces something.

Alice refers to the title character in <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>, a popular children's book by Lewis Carroll.

I hope this piece brings you spiritual sustenance for your journey! I appreciate financial contributions to sustain me as a writer, which will help bring more of my work out into the world.

<span class="hebrew">עַל הַנִּסִּים</span>  <em>al hanisim</em>
	
Upon the banners that we raised high
in pride and hope and We Are Here

And for all of the moments that raise us up





<span class="hebrew">וְעַל הַנִּפְלָאוֹת</span>  <em>v’al hanifla’ot</em>

And for the wonders
&nbsp;&nbsp;and our ability to be in wonderment
&nbsp;&nbsp;and know that we are wonderful
and for Alice





<span class="hebrew">וְעַל הַמִּלְחָמוֹת</span>  <em>v’al hamilḥamot</em>
		
and for the times that we took up the fight
and for the times that we fought for ourselves
and for the allies who fought by our side
and for the times that we won





<span class="hebrew">וְעַל הַפֻּרְקָן</span>  <em>v’al hapurkan</em>
				
and for all of the moments
that we stop and catch our breath
before doing it all again

for all of the times that we are able to see our power
and cry on each other's shoulders





<span class="hebrew">וְעַל הַגְּבוּרוֹת</span>  <em>v’al hag’vurot</em>

for all of the moments that we knew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or were willing to believe
&nbsp;&nbsp;that we were strong





<span class="hebrew">וְעַל הַתְּשׁוּעוֹת</span>  <em>v’al hat’shuot</em>
				
for all of the times that we reclaimed sacred spaces
&nbsp;&nbsp;created sacred spaces
and for all of the times of recognizing altars

and breathing and delighting
and being altars
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;portals
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vessels for the divine





for all of the shrineful moments of knowing
&nbsp;&nbsp;that our ancestors bequeathed to us





for all of the moments of Yes!
and the yesness of knowing No





for all of the huge and tiny movements
in which aliveness was present
and life won
		
and for all of the revolutions and resolutions
and for the consolations
and breaths taken





for all of the bullets that never flew
for all of the times that everything was okay
for all of the times that I forgot to worry





for all of the moments of hopefulness





for all of the times I got to hold up the banner
to touch the banner
the banner of hopeful<em>ness</em>





for all of the moments I didn't give up





<span class="instruction">add a line or two from your own life:</span>





for all of the banners that we raise up
and for all of the banners
&nbsp;&nbsp;that we have been





<span class="hebrew">בַּיָּמִים הָהֵם וּבַזְּמַן הַזֶּה</span>  <em>bayamim hahem uvaz’man hazeh<em>
