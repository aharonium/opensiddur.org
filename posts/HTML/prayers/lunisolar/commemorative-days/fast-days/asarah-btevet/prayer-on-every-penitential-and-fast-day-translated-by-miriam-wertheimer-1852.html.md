O omnipotent King! 
who sitteth upon the throne of mercy; 
governing with beneficence 
and pardoning the iniquities of His people, 
by causing them successively to pass away; 
who extendest pardon unto sinners 
and forgiveness unto transgressors; 
who evinces charity to all flesh and spirit, 
and retributes them not according to their wickedness!

O God! 
Thou hast taught us to repeat 
the thirteen attributes of Thy mercy. 
Remember then unto us, this day, 
the covenant of the thirteen attributes, 
as Thou didst reveal them of old 
to the meekest of men, even as it is written: 
"And the Eternal descended in the cloud, 
and stood with him there 
and proclaimed the name of the Eternal, 
And the Eternal passed before him, and proclaimed, 
the Eternal is the immutable, everlasting Being! 
An omnipotent God, 
merciful and gracious, long-suffering 
and abundant in beneficence and truth; 
keeping mercy for thousands, 
forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin, 
but not acquiting the guilty." <span class="citation">(Exodus 34:5-6)</span>

O! pardon our iniquity and our sin, 
and take us for Thine heritage. 
Forgive us, our Father! for we have sinned; 
pardon us, our King! for we have transgressed: 
for Thou, Eternal! art good and forgiving, 
and abundant in mercy to all who call upon Thee. 
<em>Amen</em>.

We have transcribed her translation as it was published in <em><a href="/?p=41448">Devotional Exercises for the Use of Jewish Women on Public and Domestic Occasions</a></em> (1852), pp. 71-72.
