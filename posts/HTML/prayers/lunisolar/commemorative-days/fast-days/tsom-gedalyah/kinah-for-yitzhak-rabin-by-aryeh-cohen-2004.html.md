On the day after Yitzhak Rabin was killed
Moshe remonstrated with God
as he does every day
Is this Torah and this its reward?

in the back of Akiva’s study hall
looking over nine empty rows
benches bereft of students whose
master was martyred whose 
flesh was parcelled
out in the market.

sensing the dread that was
approaching

a man took his bandages off one at

On the day after Yitzhak Rabin was killed
I stood in the cool dark Lebanese night
shouting names of friends, acquaintances 
comrades, study partners
and waited—as during the days between
Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur
when the whole world’s fate rests 
on the weight of one deed good
or evil—for the decree 
from on high, from below
from before creation 
from the barrel of a gun
from the barrel of a tank.

On the day after Yitzhak Rabin was killed,
having bathed in the mikvah in
preparation, I, pure, walked 
the sandy smooth steps 
of the Moslem Quarter
turning left then sharply right. i, pure 
entered the Temple Mount through the gate
of the Chain. Turning right again
I, Pure, paced off the area of the 
Holy of Holies.
the perfect Temple of the holy
books now forced upon the cold 
stones of the Herodian plaza
as the Dome of the Rock faded into 
invisibility i, pure, donned the vestments and 
prepared the sacrifice to GodManofWar
slaughtering the ram catching the blood
sprinkling it on the altar as if without 
intent, skinning the ram son of Isaac
removing the innards and the legs 
bringing it near on to the altar
burning it so that the pleasant smell
might satiate the One of this Place
and then removing the vestments
and gathering the sins I rode off
on a goat to die on the rocky cliffs of Azazel.
On the day after Yitzhak Rabin was killed.
