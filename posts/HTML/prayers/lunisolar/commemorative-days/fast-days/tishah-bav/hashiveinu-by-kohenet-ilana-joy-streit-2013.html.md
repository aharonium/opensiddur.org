<u>Hashiveinu</u>

Return us to ourselves
Return us to each other

Return us to the earth
Return us to our Land: the land beneath our feet

Return us to This Moment

Return us to our knowing
&nbsp;&nbsp;remembering that we know

Return us to our rhythms
Return us to our drums

Return us to sleep in the middle of the night

Return us to our deepest desires
&nbsp;&nbsp;our shared loves
&nbsp;&nbsp;our clear visions

Return us to our bodies
&nbsp;&nbsp;to our breath
&nbsp;&nbsp;to breathing easily

Return us to knowing
&nbsp;&nbsp;how beautiful we are

Return us to ourselves
Return us to each other

Return us to our good questions
&nbsp;&nbsp;our bare feet
&nbsp;&nbsp;our brilliant minds
&nbsp;&nbsp;our singing voices
Return us to falling in love
&nbsp;&nbsp;with ourselves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and each other

Return us to our Shrines
&nbsp;&nbsp;and to our shrine-keeping

Return us to our places of peacemaking

Return us to trusting each other
&nbsp;&nbsp;and ourselves
&nbsp;

Return us
&nbsp;&nbsp;turn us
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and we will dance and be held
and behold that we are whole

and be in harmony with You

Return us
&nbsp;&nbsp;keep turning us
for everything is within us
for Torah will keep coming out of us

for sweetness is
&nbsp;&nbsp;within us
and longs to return to You
