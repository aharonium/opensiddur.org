We approach Thee, O Eternal! 
with sorrowing spirits 
and hearts bowed down with grief, 
because of the dark clouds 
which overshadow our national life, 
in retribution of our grave iniquity. 
Hear us, O Lord! 
on this fast-day, 
appointed for repentance 
and purification of the sin-stained soul.

Cease from Thy wrath, 
chasten us no more in Thy anger, 
but raise us up, Father! in Thy mercy, 
for already are we sorely punished. 
Remember thy servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, 
and no more regard the stubborn, stiff-necked spirit of Thy people.

Hide not Thy gracious countenance from us, 
and withold not thy compassionate ears from our supplications, 
but be near unto our plaint, 
to console us with Thy tender mercy, 
and to hearken when we call upon Thee, 
even as Thou hast promised through thy prophet, 
"Before they call I will answer, 
while yet they are speaking I will hear." <span class="citation">(Isaiah 65:24)</span> 

Lord! 
we can no longer bring the peace offering 
to the altar of thy holiness, 
but we approach Thee on this day of sorrow 
with the sacrifice most grateful in Thy sight — 
the repentant heart and the atoning spirit turning unto Thee; 
as it is said, "The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit,
a broken and contrite heart, O God, 
thou wilt not despise." <span class="citation">(Psalms 51:17)</span>

Look then into our hearts, 
O Thou, who searchest the inward parts of man; 
in Thy mercy, accept our atonement offering 
and hearken to our supplication. 
Even if Thou shouldst have cast us from Thee, 
O God of truth and justice! 
have compassion once more upon us, 
as a tender father hath pity on his children, 
for we have sorely felt the burning of Thy wrath.

O cause us to return to Thee,

too long obscured by the shadows of our night of mourning, 
may again shine forth with a reviving splendour.

Change our mourning into joy — 
our lamentation into songs of rejoicing; 
even as thou hast consolingly revealed through Thy prophet, 
"The fast of the fourth month, 
the fast of the fifth, 
the fast of the seventh, 
and the fast of the tenth, 
shall be to the house of Judah, 
joy and gladness and cheerful feasts; 
therefore love truth and peace." <span class="citation">(Zechariah 8:19)</span>
