Eternal! Creator of the Universe, 
in Thy wisdom and in Thy goodness 
Thou hast ordained the celebration of this closing Festival 
at a time when the rich blessings of nature 
are brought home from the field of plenty. 
This Festival, especially devoted to joyfulness 
is to remind us at the same time 
of the overwhelming benefits, 
which Thou graciously conferrest upon us 
every day and every moment.

Truly from the Omnipotent come 
all things that we have, 
which rejoice and quicken us.
“How great and how many are thy works, O Lord, 
all of them hast Thou ordained in wisdom, 
the earth is full of Thy possessions.” <span class="citation">(Psalms 104:24)</span>
Thy paternal and saving hand warded off 
all danger from our fields; 
whilst divine blessing and gladness, 
joy and delight flowed down upon us in mild streams.

Never, O Lord, let me forget Thy goodness; 
let the remembrance thereof ever encourage me

so that I may cause the poor and the needy, 
the widow and the orphan, 
and the stranger in the gates, 
also to rejoice on the Festival days.

I likewise beseech Thee, O Lord, 
that the present season of the year 
may serve me as a picture of my own life, 
and rouse within me feelings of humility and devotion. 
The splendour and attraction of the earth 
is gradually vanishing, 
and the whole creation appears to wrap itself 
in gloom and mourning. 
The human mind alone is conscious of its superiority 
above the cold and inanimate creation. 
The soul, a spark of Thy Divine Spirit, 
is above decay and perishableness; 
therefore, all-wise Creator, assist me 
that I may never neglect my higher vocation. 
May this weak perishable body ever remind me 
of my higher destination, 
for which my earthly existence 
is but a preparation.

Fortify me, all-kind Father, 
that I may by virtue and uprightness, 
and the faithful performance of all my sacred duties 
render myself deserving of life eternal. 
Let Thy Laws be my guide, 
Thy precepts be my standard, 
and Thy instructions be my advisers, 
and I shall with confidence look 
for Thy favour and graciousness, 
and for our restoration to the Holy land. 
<em>Amen</em>.
