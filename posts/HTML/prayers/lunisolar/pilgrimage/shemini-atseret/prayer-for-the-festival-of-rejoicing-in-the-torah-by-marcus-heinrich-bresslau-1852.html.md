O Lord God, abundant in mercy and truth! 
Thou hast deigned thousands of years past 
to reveal Thy Law unto mankind 
for their guidance on earth 
and their salvation in a future life. 
This law, 
as unchangeable as its Divine author 
is yet and ever will be preserved by them. 
Truly this law emanating from the Essence of perfection 
“Is perfect, quickening the soul;” <span class="citation">(Psalms 19:8)</span>
the statutes ordained by Thee, O God of righteousness, 
are “Righteous, rejoicing the heart.” <span class="citation">(Psalms 19:9)</span>

through Thy faithful servant Moses.
