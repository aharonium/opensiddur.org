<u><em>Mah Nishtanah</em>: what needs to change</em></u>

What needs to change
so the world as it is
can wake up?

What needs to change
so the world as it is
can love us?

What needs to change
right now
so we can breathe?

What needs to change
so our sisters and brothers
can be as free as we are?

and what needs to change
so that we
can be free too?

What needs to change
in our voices, our postures,
our pacing

What needs to change
in how
we try to change our bodies

What needs to change
in our newspapers
and in our budgets

What needs to change
in our language
and in our bedrooms

What needs to change
in how
we look in the mirror

What needs to change
in our lovemaking
in every moment

What needs to change -- tonight!
so we may wake up
freer in the morning

What needs to change
next week
to nurture all the Miriams and Mosheâ€™s?

And what needs to change
so that every Pharaoh
gets twelve hugs a day?

What needs to change
so that I have a voice
and you have ears?

i know what needs to change
and you know what needs to change
and we will be the change

<em>amen</em>
