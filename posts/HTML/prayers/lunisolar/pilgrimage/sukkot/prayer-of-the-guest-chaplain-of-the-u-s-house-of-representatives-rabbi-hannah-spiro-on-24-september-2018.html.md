God, 
we thank You for the Jewish festival of Sukkot, 
which begins today, 
and for Your commandment 
to build temporary structures, 
to eat and sleep in them 
under the stars, 
and to welcome in guests––
honored guests, 
guests in need. 
You teach us that these are one and the same.

<td style="vertical-align:top;">
<div class="english" lang="en">
Your festival teaches us 
to come to terms with impermanence––
of these temporary structures, 
our actual homes, 
our wealth, 
our social standing, 
and even our lives. 
When we remember, 
as Ecclesiastes teaches, 
that we came from dust 
and will return to it,[foot]Cf. Ecclesiastes 3:20[/foot]
we can't possibly feel justified 
in holding onto our resources 
with a clenched fist. 
You move us 
to open our hands 
and homes 
in generosity, 
inclusion, 
and justice.

<div class="english" lang="en">
May the Sukkot season 
and the beauty of changing autumn leaves 
inspire each one of us 
to welcome, 
to serve, and, 
for this brief time we are allotted, 
to generously live.
</div></td></tr>
