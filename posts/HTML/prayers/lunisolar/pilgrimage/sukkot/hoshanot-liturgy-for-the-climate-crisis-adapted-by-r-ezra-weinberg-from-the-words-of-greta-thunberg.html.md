<em>Hoshana!</em>  That governments, political parties and corporations grasp the urgency of the cli<span class="acrostic">m</span>ate crisis.  <em>Hoshana!</em>

<em>Hoshana!</em>  It’s time to face the reality, the facts, the science.  <em>Hoshana!</em> (SAVE US NOW!) 
<em>Hoshana!</em>  Science doesn’t speak of “great opportunities” to create the society we always wanted.  <em>Hoshana!</em>  
<em>Hoshana!</em>  Science tells of unspoken human sufferings, which will get worse the longer we delay action.  <em>Hoshana!</em>  
<em>Hoshana!</em>  This is, above all, an emergency, and not just any emergency.  <em>Hoshana!</em>  
<em>Hoshana!</em>  This is the biggest crisis humanity has ever faced.  <em>Hoshana!</em>  
<em>Hoshana!</em>  You can not solve a crisis without treating it as one.  <em>Hoshana!</em>  
<em>Hoshana!</em>  The best available scientific calculations do not include non-linear tipping points.  <em>Hoshana!</em>  
<em>Hoshana!</em>  Unforeseen feedback loops like the extremely powerful methane gas escaping from rapidly thawing arctic permafrost.  <em>Hoshana!</em>

<em>Hoshana!</em>  So where do we begin?  <em>Hoshana!</em> (SAVE US NOW!)
<em>Hoshana!</em>  I would suggest that we start looking at <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2019/02/SR15_Chapter2_Low_Res.pdf">chapter 2, on page 108 in the IPCC report</a> that came out last year. <em>Hoshana!</em>  
<em>Hoshana!</em>  Richer countries need to do their fair share and get down to zero emissions much faster <em>Hoshana!</em>  
<em>Hoshana!</em>  The USA is the biggest carbon polluter in history <em>Hoshana!</em>  
<em>Hoshana!</em>  And yet, the US is the only nation in the world that has signaled an intention to leave <a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement">the Paris Agreement</a>.  <em>Hoshana!</em>  
<em>Hoshana!</em>  Because quote “it was a bad deal for the USA.”  <em>Hoshana!</em> 
<em>Hoshana!</em>  The numbers are very uncomfortable.  <em>Hoshana!</em>  
<em>Hoshana!</em>  But people have the right to know.  <em>Hoshana!</em>  
<em>Hoshana!</em>  We must not allow this to continue to be a partisan political question.  <em>Hoshana!</em> 
<em>Hoshana!</em>  And our main enemy right now is not our political opponents.  <em>Hoshana!</em> 
<em>Hoshana!</em>  Our main enemy now is physics. And we can not make “deals” with physics.  <em>Hoshana!</em> 
<em>Hoshana!</em>  Americans have indeed made great sacrifices to overcome terrible odds before.  <em>Hoshana!</em>  
<em>Hoshana!</em>  You must unite behind the science.  <em>Hoshana!</em>  
<em>Hoshana!</em>  Because giving up can never ever be an option.  <em>Hoshana!</em>  
<em>Hoshana!</em>  The world is waking up. And change is coming, whether you like it or not.  <em>Hoshana!</em>
<em>Hoshana!</em>  <em>Hoshana!</em>  <em>Hoshana!</em> <em>Hoshana!</em>

The "Hoshanot liturgy for Climate Crisis" by Reb Ezra Weinberg, adapting the words of Greta Thunberg (from her <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/09/23/763452863/transcript-greta-thunbergs-speech-at-the-u-n-climate-action-summit">UN Speech, Sept 23, 2019</a>), was first published in PDF format on Ritualwell along with an <a href="https://www.ritualwell.org/ritual/climate-crisis-hoshanot-words-greta-thunberg">explanatory essay</a>. Subsequently, the work was lightly edited by Rabbi Riqi Kosovske.
