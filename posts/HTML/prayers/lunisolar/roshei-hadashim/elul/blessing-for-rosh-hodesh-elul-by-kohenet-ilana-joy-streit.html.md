A blessing for announcing the new moon of Elul, for Rosh Ḥodesh Elul, and for the whole month. A poem of kindness, rootedness and transformation as we enter into a time of turning and returning.

May we turn and return
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to glimpses of beauty and truth

May this month and the year ahead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be a time of compassion and grace

May healing show the way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may our footsteps show the way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may new melodies guide us

May we lend each other faith
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as if it was a cup of sugar (because it is)

May we bake muffins of kindness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pies of gentleness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brownies of generosity

May this year be so sweet that
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it inspires a new profession
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spiritual dentistry

May we be well-midwifed this year
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may we be the ones that our shadows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have been waiting for, this year

May we tend altars of forgiveness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and drink often from their waters

May our breadcrumbs feed the birds of transformation

May there be a week in the coming year
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when all we read is children's books
May these next 40 days be a time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when we clean all of our own and each other's mirrors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that we may then celebrate our own place
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in Creation and in Torah 

May we then dance about and around the Torah of our own lives
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and may we write and live
the Torah of our own lives

May moonlight shine upon our
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;joy and celebration and blessed sleep this year
May the sparks of liberation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the yuntif candles burn away any last bits of regret
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and shame and disconnection

May we enter into this turning time whole
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may it be a time of mending quilts
and returning long-borrowed books

May it be a time of flowing ink from the pens of wisdom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and flowing tears from the eyes of hope
