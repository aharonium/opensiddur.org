A juicy, playful poem for connection and redemption.

A blessing for announcing the new moon of Adar, for Rosh Ḥodesh Adar, and for the whole month.

May we be the poppy seeds in each other's hamentaschen
this year

may the world be sweet to the taste
&nbsp;&nbsp;soft to the touch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and moonlight to the eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and redemption to the soul

may we design contests in which we all win
may we design beauty contests to which each moment
&nbsp;&nbsp;is a contender

may we all be blessed with cousins who have our backs
&nbsp;&nbsp;and who would fast on our account

may we recognize when we are Esther
&nbsp;&nbsp;when we are Mordecai
and when we are Aḥashverosh

may we keep remembering to forget to remember

may we each and may all of us appear at the party of our lives
&nbsp;&nbsp;wearing the crown of our royalty
and whatever the hell else we choose
