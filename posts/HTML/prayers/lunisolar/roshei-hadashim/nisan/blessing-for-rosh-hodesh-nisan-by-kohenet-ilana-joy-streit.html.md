A tender poem about hope and liberation, as we move day by day towards the full moon that marks the beginning of Passover.

A blessing for announcing the new moon of Nisan, for Rosh Ḥodesh Nisan, and for the whole month.

Shine on us, shine into us,
Sliver of moonlight
Teardrop of a slave

Shine down on us, shine on over to us,
chaff of wheat tired of hearing the cries
of people whose hearts have
been pounded down like matza

Shine towards us:
this is how much light we can hold
this is how much light we can digest
and no more

O Moon of Nisan
be gentle with us
we have never known you before

we have been waiting for you for
all of our lives
for so many generations

give us time
and when you grow into a whole matza
we will be ready
