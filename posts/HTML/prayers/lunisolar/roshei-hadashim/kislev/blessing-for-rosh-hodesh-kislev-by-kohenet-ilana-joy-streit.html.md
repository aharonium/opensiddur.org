A poem-blessing for the Hebrew month of Kislev, suitable for Birkat HaḤodesh, Rosh Ḥodesh Kislev, and the whole month.

Please note that this was written in the Northern Hemisphere and conveys the experience of Ḥeshvan as a winter month.

The references to Hershel and hard-boiled eggs are from the popular picture book, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hershel_and_the_Hanukkah_Goblins">Hershel and the Ḥanukkah Goblins</a></em>, by Eric A. Kimmel, which is highly recommended both in general and in further understanding this poem.

May we be nourished by the darkness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and by the light





May we be held in our moments of darkness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and see the ripples of our light





May all of the Shabbat candles from the past year cheer us on
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;illuminate our path to rededication
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;give us just a bit more energy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;team up with the stars to brighten our faces and hearts





May Hershel stay with us all year
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may we dress up as him for Purim and offer hard-boiled eggs to misguided politicians





May we let our dreams be our ḥevrutas





And may we put the Lev back in Kislev
