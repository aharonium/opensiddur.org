A poem-blessing for the Hebrew month of Ḥeshvan, suitable for Birkat HaḤodesh and for Rosh Ḥodesh Ḥeshvan itself. Also to be kept in the pocket of Jewish communal leaders during Elul and Tishrei.

Please note that this was written in the Northern Hemisphere and conveys the experience of Ḥeshvan as an autumn month.

May all of the ḥavurah leaders, rabbis, cantors, and Hebrew priestesses 
heave one giant sigh of relief 
(and be able to cook for themselves 
and answer personal emails 
and read New Yorker cartoons)





May all of the synagogue administrators 
get massages 
and pedicures 
and days off 
and empty to do lists





May the Torah hold us





May the matriarchs and patriarchs 
hold us
and whisper to us 
and dance with us





May we keep dancing, 
far beyond Simḥat Torah 





May sweetness now be folded into our lives 
like laundry, 
as if it belonged, 
which it does





May Mr. Ḥeshvan be a kind and friendly sort of man, 
like a next-door neighbor 
who will shovel our sidewalk 
every so often





May there not be any snow this Ḥeshvan





May our hearts be warmed instead of the earth





May autumn descend gently, 
may we find both gloves in each pair





May we reconnect 
with the joys of soup 
and fireplaces 
and snuggling in a warm bed
