A soulful, playful, embodied, grounded poem for announcing the new moon of Tishrei, for Rosh Ḥodesh Tishrei (otherwise known as Rosh haShanah) and for the whole month.

While the world is pregnant with possibility
may we each prepare, ingest, and share
our own particular blend of prenatal vitamins

May there be enough midwives
that we each get a turn to sleep

May all of the slices of apples
create a banner of love
over our cities and farms

May all of the honey
spill over into our schools
and drip down into our language

May our good strong roots grow ever deeper
aided by the company of last year's compost
</div></td></tr>
