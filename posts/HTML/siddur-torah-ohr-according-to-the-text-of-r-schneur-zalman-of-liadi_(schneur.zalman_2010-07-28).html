Join us in creating a faithful digital transcription of the <a href="http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A4%D7%AA%D7%97:Siddur_Torah_Ohr_%28Schulzinger_Bros._1940%29.pdf"><em>Siddur Torah Ohr</em></a> (R' Schneur Zalman of Liadi (1745-1812)), a critical text of the nusaḥ ha-ARI z"l.

The <em>Siddur Torah Ohr</em> was originally prepared by the Alter Rebbe, R' Schneur Zalman of Liadi (1745-1812), the founder of the חב״ד ḤaBaD movement within <em>Ḥassidut</em>. <em>Torah Ohr</em> witnesses the Nusaḥ Ha-Ari, a nusaḥ prepared by R' Schneur Zalman of Liadi according to the tradition of R' Yitzchak Luria, also known as the ARI. This siddur was originally published in 1803 in Shklov. The edition we are transcribing was prepared by anonymous editors according to the text of R' Schneur Zalman of Liadi and published by Shulzinger Brothers in Brooklyn, New York 1940.

Transcription of the siddur including commentary began in 2006 on <a href="http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%93%D7%95%D7%A8_%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8">Wikisource</a>. Integration of wikisource material with this transcription effort was completed in July 2010. In June 2010, we received some transcriptions of liturgy prepared by Shmuel Gonzales for a another, later siddur prepared by Ḥabad, the <em>Siddur Tehillat Hashem</em>. If you are looking for downloadable segments of transcribed liturgy, please check Shmuel Gonzales' <a href="http://opensiddur.org/2010/08/nusa%E1%B8%A5-ha-ari-a-new-transcription-by-shmuel-gonzales/">Nusach Ha-Ari transcriptions</a>.

After transcription and proofreading, this new digital edition will be shared under a Creative Commons Zero (CC0) Public Domain dedication. The edition will then be encoded in TEI XML and archived in the <a href="http://app.opensiddur.org">Open Siddur database</a>, a <em>libre</em> Open Access liturgy database.
