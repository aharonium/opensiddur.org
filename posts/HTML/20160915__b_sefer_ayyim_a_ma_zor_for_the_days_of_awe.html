This is a complete* Jewish Renewal/Reconstructionist Machzor for Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, primarily influenced by the davennin of Reb Zalman and the <a href="http://www.aquarianminyan.org/">Aquarian Minyan</a>. All text in English is gender-neutral. All Hebrew prayers are accompanied by transliteration. Material for Shabbat is at the back of the book. Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur prayers are combined (so some pages need to be skipped depending), but there should be a minimum of flipping back and forth.

<ul>
<li>NOTE: It does not contain a Mincha service. The Torah reading for Yom Kippur morning is the Reform alternative (<em>U'vacharta bachayyim</em>).</li>
</ul>

This Machzor is derivative of many works, which it tries to credit whenever known. It makes what I believe to be fair use of limited and credited excerpts of works not in the Public Domain, for purposes of education and prayer.
