<h3>About</h3>

Siddur Olas Tamid is written in XeLaTeX markup language. It became my project once I learned how to typeset Hebrew using XeLaTeX. I originally wrote this siddur for myself since I was unable to find a bound siddur of the German rite. However I wanted my siddur to be refined enough so that anybody with a background in tefila would be able to use it.

Everything is arranged very carefully to maintain a pleasing page layout with plenty of visual cues. Among the visual cues are the vignettes on the chapter and section headings, as well as the bolding of the first words of important paragraphs.

You will not find any commentary, nor will you find much instruction of how to perform certain tefilos and rituals. Instead I’ve focused on minimalist instructions. The reason for this is to maintain the flow of the text.

If the reader is interested in learning more about German Jewish customs, some great resources are <a href="http://www.moreshesashkenaz.org/">Machon Moreshes Ashkenaz</a>, the <a href="http://www.kayj.net/en/forum/category/list">K’hal Adas Yeshurun Jerusalem</a> forums, and <a href="http://opensiddur.org/compilations/siddurim/siddur-bneiashkenaz- a-german-rite-siddur-prepared-by-r-rallis-wiesenthal/">Tefiloh Sefas Yisroel</a>, which is the work that my own siddur is based on.

<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>

I would like to extend my most profound gratitude to those who helped me put this work together. Especially for my wife, for without her I surely wouldn’t have gotten very far. She allowed me the many hours I spent working on this project.

Rabbi Raphael Davidovich, Rabbi Benjamin Levi, Rabbi Sholmo Hunger,H. aver Mark Selent, Mr. Brian Rothenberg, Rabbi Jason Claude, and Steven Perlin all helped out in their own ways by answering questions about nusaḥ, instructions, page layout, and every inane detail of tefila.

Rabbi Rallis Wiesenthal did a great חסד by providing much of the text available under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike licence and providing his own input. Ari Auerbach, and many others on Stack Exchange helped with the source code.

The Wolf logo was drawn by Yisroel Mendenhall. Most of all I would like to thank Ha-Shem, Der Ewige, for bringing me to the occasion of being able to put together such a work. Forgive me for anyone whom I may have forgotten to mention above. Please attribute all errors to me, be them in ḥ, instructions, page layout, or anything else.
