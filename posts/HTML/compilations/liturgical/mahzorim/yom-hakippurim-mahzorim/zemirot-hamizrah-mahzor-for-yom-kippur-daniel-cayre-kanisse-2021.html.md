<em>Zemirot HaMizraḥ</em> is the first and (so far) only Sephardic/Mizraḥi egalitarian and inclusive Hebrew and English maḥzor of its kind. With full English translation and select transliteration, this abridged Yom Kippur prayerbook provides traditional texts with egalitarian and inclusive revisions, alternative options for those desiring more contemporary prayer, and extended versions of traditional prayers in its appendix. Spanning four distinct traditions, our maḥzor includes the full liturgy of the following rites: Moroccan, Eastern Communities (“‘Edot HaMizraḥ”, including Iraqi, Persian and communities of West/Central Asia), Syrian, and Spanish-Portuguese. The prayerbook’s title, which translates as “Songs of the East,” highlights the musical traditions of the Sephardic and Mizraḥi world, with lyrical translation of piyutim that can be sung to traditional Hebrew melodies.
