PREFACE.

This book contains several services for Jewish worship. They are derived almost entirely from the traditional liturgy. The translations are selected from the Union Prayer Book, the Rev. S. Singer's issue of the Daily Prayer Book, and from the Order of Service of the Jewish Religious Union. The passages from the Bible are given according to the Revised Version. All the additional prayers, as well as the selection of Scripture verses, are adopted from the book of the Jewish Religious Union, to the editors of which the Committee is greatly indebted.
