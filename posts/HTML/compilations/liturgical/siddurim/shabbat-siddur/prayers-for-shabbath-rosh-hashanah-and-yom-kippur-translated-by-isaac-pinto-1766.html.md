PREFACE. 

A Veneration for the Language, <em>sacred</em> by being that in which it pleased Almighty God to reveal himself to our Ancestors, and a desire to preserve it, in firm Persuasion that it will again be re-established in Israel, are probably leading Reasons for our performing divine Service in Hebrew: But that, being imperfectly understood by many, by some, not at all; it has been necessary to translate our Prayers, in the Language of the Country wherein it hath pleased the divine Providence to appoint our Lot. In Europe, the Spanish and Portuguese Jews have a Translation in Spanish, which as they generally understand, may be sufficient; but that not being the Case in the British Dominions in America, has induced me to Attempt a Translation in English, not without Hope that it will tend to the Improvement of many of my Brethren in their Devotion; and if it answer that Good Intention, it will afford me the Satisfaction of having contributed towards it. In Justice to the Learned and Reverend H.H.R. Ishac Nieto, I must have received from his Elegant Spanish Translation of the Prayers of Rosh-hashanah and Kippur: From which, by particular Desire, I have taken the Liberty of translating his Exhortation, and prefixing it to these Sheets. Not withstanding my utmost Care, I make no doubt this Translation has its Errors, and the Stile I am sensible has its Defects, which I hope will meet with Indulgence from the candid Reader.
