PREFACE 


This prayer-book contains the traditional prayers for week-days, as well as the benedictions which are recited at home, on all occasions. 

The Evening Prayers were placed at the beginning of this volume, with the hope that it will serve the purpose of impressing the reader with the basic principle in Jewish life that the day begins with the preceding evening. 

The English translation has been adopted from the best versions used in England and in America. Our thanks are due to the Jewish Publication Society of America for its kind permission to reprint in this volume its English version of all Biblical passages that form part of the regular prayers. 

It has long been felt that the rendition of the word “Torah” by “Law” has been erroneous, since the word Torah is in most cases used for the entire body of sacred Hebrew literature. (See Jewish Encyclopedia, Vol. XII, p. 196c.) Hence the word “Torah” is used in the English translation; and the interested reader who is not acquainted with the Hebrew will find its definition in any standard dictionary.
