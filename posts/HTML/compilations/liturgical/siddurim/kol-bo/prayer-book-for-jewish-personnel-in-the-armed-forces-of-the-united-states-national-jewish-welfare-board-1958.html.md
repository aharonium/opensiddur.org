<blockquote>PREFACE

This prayer book has been prepared by the Commission on Jewish Chaplaincy of the National Jewish Welfare Board for use at religious services of Jewish personnel in the Armed Forces and in federal hospitals of the United States of America. It is not intended for general use by the civilian population. Its shortened and compact form has been designed for the specific purpose of use by military congregations. Jewish service personnel who desire to possess and employ a more complete prayer book for their personal devotions are encouraged to do so.

It is hoped that this prayer book will not only be a source of inspiration to the Jewish personnel in the Armed Forces and a link in the chain of faith that binds them to their homes and their families while they are in the military service, but that it will also be a means of strengthening their loyalty to their religious tradition both during and after their years in the Armed Forces.

Commission on Jewish Chaplaincy
