This is עלת תמיד <em>Olath Tamid</em> by Rev. Dr. David Einhorn (1809-1878), in its German-Hebrew edition (1858). Rabbi Dr. Dalia Marx writes:

<blockquote>Rabbi David Einhorn’s prayer book <em>`Olat Tamid</em> (lit. the perpetual sacrifice)...first penned in Germany, served as the model for the Union Prayer Book,....the prayer book of the American Reform movement for almost eight decades. It reflected what is now called “classical Reform,” eliminating prayers for the restoration of Zion, mentions of the messiah, and bodily resurrection of the dead, while diminishing mentions of Jewish chosenness and the like.</blockquote>
