<blockquote>PREFATORY NOTE.

This Prayer Book is substantially the same as that issued in the latter part of the Great War. The Prayer for those on Active Service, the Prayer before a Battle, and the War and Intercession Prayers have all been revised; and a few of the Statutory Prayers are given in a free rendering.

The translation of the other Prayers is, by kind permission of the Jewish Religious Education Board, taken from the Authorised Prayer Book.

This new edition was seen through the Press by the Senior Jewish Chaplain, Dayan M. Gollop, S.C.F., B.A.

J. H. H.
Office of the Chief Rabbi,
23rd Shevat, 5700.
2nd February, 1940.
