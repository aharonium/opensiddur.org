PREFATORY NOTE.

This abbreviated form of the Prayer Book has been compiled for the use of Jewish members of His Majesty’s Navy and Army. It is hoped that this book will meet the wants of the very large number of English Jews who are taking part in the present Great European War. It has been officially accepted for distribution by the Admiralty and the War Office.

By kind permission of the Jewish Religious Education Board, the text of Singer’s Authorised Prayer Book has been used.

The book is issued with the sanction of the Chief Rabbi.

MICHAEL ADLER, Chaplain.
38, Hallam Street, London, W.

<blockquote>
NOTE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.

The present Edition completes an issue of 16,000 copies. This fact testifies to the number of our brethren who are engaged on active service to-day. I am happy to know that the Prayer Book has become very endeared to my gallant comrades in H. M. Forces, both on sea and on land, who are doing their duty so well for King and Country.

May speedy victory be the answer to our prayers !

M. A.
G.H.Q., British Expeditionary Force, France,
27th June 1915.
