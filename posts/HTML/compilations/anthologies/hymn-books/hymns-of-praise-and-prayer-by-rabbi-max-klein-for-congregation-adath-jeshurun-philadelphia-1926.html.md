In sending forth this volume of hymns for the use of the congregation, I desire to record my deepest thanks to those whose words I have included in this collection. I feel certain that it will be a source of happiness to them to know that their words will be sung by thousands who never sang them before. 

In accordance with the practise in hymnology, I have taken the liberty to alter original texts either in language, for the clarification of thought, or in metre for the sake of melody, when I felt that the change would make the hymn more adapted to the needs of the congregation. I have indicated through two stars wherever hymns have been rewritten or considerably altered by me. 

It has been a labor of love to edit this volume and a still greater labor of love to write the words of my own hymns. I lay them all now before the congregation in the fond hope that they may help us find solace in our griefs, and at all times inspiration for our work; that through these hymns of praise, prayer and aspiration we may come closer to God and man. 

In dedicating my work and its fruits to the memory of the Reverend Alexander Gross who led this congregation in worship for thirty years, I am paying a tribute to one who was a beloved minister in his own congreÂ¬ gation and widely esteemed in the community at large. May the memory of a faithful servant of God, now further associated with our worship through these hymns, remain an abiding inspiration in our midst. 

May God grant us and the whole House of Israel his blessing in the year about to begin.
