The first prayerbook compiled by an American Jewish woman, and quite possibly by the first Jewish woman ever, is the hymn-book of Penina Moïse (1797-1880), prepared for her congregation Beth Elohim in Charleston, South Carolina in 1842. This is the first edition (1842) containing 74 hymns (61 of which are by Penina Moïse) and the fourth printing of the revised edition first published in 1856 containing 210 hymns including material by <a href="/profile/moritz-mayer/">Rabbi Moritz Mayer</a> and others affiliated with Beth Elohim. 

While the majority of the hymns published are attributed Penina Moïse (as P.M.), a handful of other authors are also occasionally indicated by their initials. We can identify four of these with certainty: Cordelia Moïse Cohen (1809-1869), Caroline de Litchfield Harby (1800-1876), Moritz Mayer (1821-1866), and Gershon Lazarus (1804-1868).[foot]Gershon Lazarus is identified as Gershom Lazarus in the 1914 CCAR <em>Union Hymnal</em>. There was a Gershom Lazarus in Charleston at the time, working as a steamboat inspector in the Custom House from 1847-1858. Unfortunately, we know very little else about him. Some correspondence of his is recorded in the <a href="https://www.lcfhs.org/uploads/1/1/9/8/119823026/bulletin_oct_1983.pdf">Bulletin of the Lower Cape Fear Historical Society</a>, October 1983.[/foot] The identity of the remaining author, J.C.L.,[foot]J.C.L. may indicate Jacob Lazarus or possibly, Jacob C. Levy (d. 1875).[/foot] remains a mystery.

The <a href="https://www.kestenbaum.net/auction/lot/auction-58/058-011/">very first edition</a> of Moïse's hymn-book was published as <em>Hymns Written for the Service of the Hebrew Congregation Beth Elohim, Charleston, S.C.</em> (1842), over a decade before Fanny Neuda's <em><a href="/?p=6753">Stunden der Andacht</a></em> (Hours of Devotion) in 1855, or Hester Rothschild's English translation of the French anthology of tehinot and paraliturgical prayer, <em>Imrei Lev</em> (<em><a href="/?p=31179">Prayers and Meditations</a></em>, also in 1855).
