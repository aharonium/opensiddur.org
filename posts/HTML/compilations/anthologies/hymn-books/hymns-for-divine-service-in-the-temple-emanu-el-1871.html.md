A collection of hymns used by Temple Emanu-El in New York City. The hymn book mainly contains hymns in German with English translation by Rabbi James Koppel Gutheim (1817-1886), who was at that time serving as rabbi of Temple Emanu-El. Another handful of hymns in English include one by Rabbi Moritz Mayer (1821-1867), and the rest by a young Felix Adler (before his founding of Ethical Culture).
