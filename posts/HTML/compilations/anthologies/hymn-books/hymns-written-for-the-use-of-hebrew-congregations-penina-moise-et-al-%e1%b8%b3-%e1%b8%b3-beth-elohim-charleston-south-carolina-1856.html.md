The first prayerbook compiled by an American Jewish woman, and quite possibly by the first Jewish woman ever, is the hymn-book of Penina Moïse (1797-1880), prepared for her congregation Beth Elohim in Charleston, South Carolina in 1842. This is the second edition (revised 1856) containing 210 hymns, reprinting 73 of the hymns appearing in the 1842 albeit with changes, mostly to punctuation and capitalization, but sometimes with significant changes to wording and omission of entire stanzas. There are in total 137 hymns that are new to this edition (128 of which were written by Penina Moïse). The two other contributors providing new material to the work, identified by their initials, are <a href="/profile/moritz-mayer/">Rabbi Moritz Mayer</a> (1821-1866) and <a href="/profile/caroline-de-litchfield-harby">Caroline de Litchfield Harby</a> (1800-1876). There are three hymns which are unsigned with any initials, but were likely to have been written by Penina Moïse and Moritz Mayer.

The 1842 edition of the hymn-book, <em><a href="/?p=39305">Hymns Written for the Service of the Hebrew Congregation Beth Elohim, Charleston, S.C.</a></em> (1842) was written over a decade before Fanny Neuda's <em><a href="/?p=6753">Stunden der Andacht</a></em> (Hours of Devotion) in 1855, or Hester Rothschild's English translation of the French anthology of tehinot and paraliturgical prayer, <em>Imrei Lev</em> (<em><a href="/?p=31179">Prayers and Meditations</a></em>, also in 1855). This edition, published within a year of the latter, is yet another indication of the popularity of prayer literature written by or for Jewish women at this time.
