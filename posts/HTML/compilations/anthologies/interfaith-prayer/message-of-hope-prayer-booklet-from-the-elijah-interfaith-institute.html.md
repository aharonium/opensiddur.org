St. Paul says in Rom 8, 24-25: 
“In hope, we already have salvation; 
in hope not visibly present, 
or we should not be hoping--
nobody goes on hoping for something he can already see. 
But having this hope for what we cannot yet see, 
we are to wait for it with persevering confidence” (Romans 8, 24-25, New Jerusalem Bible)

Let none deceive another,

Let none through anger or ill-will 
Wish harm upon another.

Her child, her only child,

Should one cherish all living beings; 
Radiating kindness over the entire world: 
Spreading upwards to the skies, 
And downwards to the depths; 
Outwards and unbounded, 
Freed from hatred and ill-will.

Merciful, most Merciful, is my master God. 
He bestows His divine blessings upon all beings. (Pause) 
Do not waver, O mortal being. The Creator God Himself shall protect you. 
He who created you, will also look after you. (1)
The One who created the world, also takes care of it. 
He dwells in every heart and mind, He is the True protector. (2)
His creative power and capacity is infinite and incomprehensible; He is as Great as He is carefree. 
O mortal being, meditate upon Him, as long as there is breath in your body. (3)
Almighty God, You are all-powerful, indescribable and incomprehensible; my soul, body and mind are all yours. 
 It is only through Your Mercy and compassion that there can be happiness and peace - so prays Nanak. (4)(3)
