This is the anthology of teḥinot, <em>Devotional Exercises for the Use of Jewish Women on Public and Domestic Occasions</em> (1852), translated by Miriam Wertheimer from an unknown work in German but misattributed somehow to Wolfgang Wessely. (We have not been able to locate any text in German from which this work was derived. If you know the title, then please leave a comment or <a href="/contact/">contact us</a>.) As we have begun to transcribe and recognize the work of Meir Letteris, we tentatively attribute the source of this translation to him.

Wertheimer dedicated her translation to her friend, writing, "To my beloved friend Hester, this little volume is inscribed, as a slight tribute of affection, and in recognition of her many virtues as a Daughter of Israel, by her friend, the Translator. Birmingham, April, 1852."

<blockquote>PREFACE.

Every incident of our existence is calculated to excite admiration at the marvellous workings of Providence, and to elicit from the grateful heart expressions of devotion and thankfulness. Pious men of all ages have compiled services rich in sacred eloquence, and adapted for every purpose of public worship. But there are occasions of a special nature, which would seem to require a more peculiar form of prayer and praise; bringing the soul, like the primitive adorations of the early patriarchs, into immediate communion, as if listening to, and conversing with, its Divine Progenitor. More especially are such prayers required by the daughters of Israel; many of whom, though animated with fervent piety and gratitude, seek in vain for words expressive of their ardent feelings, and the meek but heavenward aspirations which elevate their souls amidst every daily duty, every earthly occurrence. The daughter of Israel feels that there are times and seasons, holy festivals, and sacred observances, when she would wish to meet with a concise form of prayer, echoing the sentiments of her heart, suited to all occasions, and ready to fill all vacant intervals. Among our continental neighbours, this want has been already recognized and responded to; men of eminent piety have not disdained to exert their mental and literary endowments in the compilation of a compendium for the use of our sex, fitted for all periods of public worship or special observance. The most celebrated is that arranged by <strong>Dr. Wolfgang Wessely</strong>, a faithful translation of which is now offered to the English public. It will be found simple, but energetic; humbly devout, yet fervently eloquent; equally suited for the house of prayer or the retirement of the closet. These addresses are penned in so genuine and unaffected a style, that they come home to every bosom, and awaken the sympathies in every circumstance of existence, gladdening the soul in prosperity, and awakening consolation even in the gloom of adversity.</blockquote>
