This is a collection of <em>teḥinot</em> in the English vernacular found as a supplement (with its own pagination) added to Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise's <em>Daily Prayers of American Israelites</em>. It is uncertain currently whether Rabbi Wise was the author of these <em>teḥinot</em> or whether they are translations of supplications found in earlier collections in German, French, English, and Yiddish. If you know the origin of any specific <em>teḥinah</em> please <a href="/contact/">contact us</a> or leave a comment below.
