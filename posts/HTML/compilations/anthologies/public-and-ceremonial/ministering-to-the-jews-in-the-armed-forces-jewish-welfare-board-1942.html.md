<blockquote>FOREWORD 

The Committee on Army and Navy Religious Activities of the Jewish Welfare Board wishes to express its thanks to Chaplain Aryeh Lev of the Office of the Chief of Chaplains, Washington, D. C., who has prepared this pamphlet. It has been compiled tentatively as an aid to chaplains, civilian rabbis, and Jewish Welfare Board field rep- resentatives who may be called on to minister religiously to the sick, dying, and dead in our armed forces. It contains the following sections: Prayers for the Sick, a Military Funeral Service, and a Memorial Service for Those Fallen in Battle. The form of burial service follows military regulations. The Committee would appreciate receiving suggestions as to how to enhance the usefulness of this manual. 

The liturgy and prayers have been culled from various sources—Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform. Permission has been received to reprint prayers from the following books: <em>Sabbath and Festival Services</em> by Morris Silverman, Prayer Book Press, Hartford, Connecticut; <em>Union Prayer Book and Rabbis’ Manual</em>, Central Conference of American Rabbis. Blank pages have been added for additional selections. The Jewish Welfare Board’s “<em>Abridged Prayer Book</em>” and “<em>Selections from the Holy Scriptures</em>,” are also available at army posts and aboard ship. 

David de‎ Sola Pool, Chairman 
Committee on Army and Navy Religious Activities</blockquote>
