PREFACE 

This volume contains, as its name indicates, pulpit and public prayers for various occasions. The need for such a collection has long been felt. It has always been the custom in Israel to recite special prayers during the regular service, in other than the Hebrew language, as evidenced by the ancient prayers of <em>Brich Shemeh</em>, at the open ark, and <em>Yekum Purkan</em>, which are in the Aramaic, the vernacular of the people in olden times. It is, therefore, natural that these and similar prayers should now be recited in English. Then again, the Rabbi is very frequently called upon, to open or close important public functions with prayer. The composition of special prayers forms an important part of the Rabbi’s work; and it is our hope that this collection will facilitate his performance of this particular task. 

It is not our intention to produce a book of “ready-made” prayers to be read or recited by the minister in the pulpit or at a public function, though the volume contains a considerable number of prayers, like those of Chief Rabbi Dr. Joseph H. Hertz, Dr. Jaceb Kohn, Dr. Israel H. Levinthal, and others, that may be properly used in this manner. The main purpose of this volume is to guide and direct the minister in his efforts to write special prayers. For this reason we include a number of prayers which refer to, or make mention of special circumstances that might never again occur; they may merely be used as examples. 

Our grateful acknowledgement is due to the Rabbis, who responded to our letter, and sent in their contributions to this volume.
