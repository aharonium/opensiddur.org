PREFACE 

"Just as a man must ever find new sources of meaning and comprehension in the Torah, so in the Service of the Heart, which is prayer, must a man find new sources of love and devotion every day." --Rabbi Menaḥem Mendel of Kosov 

The traditional prayerbook is the bastion of Jewish living. Through the centuries the Jew would turn to it many times every dav at home and in the synagogue. To the Ḥasid, finding new sources of love and devotion in the Siddur was a labor of joy. 

We who are not Ḥasidim still find in our prayerbooks the heart of our Service. Yet in our search for meaning in prayer we would turn from time to time to other books. 

The purpose of <em>An Offering of Prayer</em> is to supplement the prayerbooks, to provide prayers on subjects that are not dealt with in traditional material or that reflect more exactly the temper of our day. 

The great majority of the prayers included here are of Jewish origin, but I have included some work of non-Jews that seemed in consonance with the spirit of our religion. 

To all of those who have allowed me to use their prayers, to all those who aided in the collecting and arranging of this material, or who assisted in its publication, I offer my gratitude. 

Especially do I thank the members of Temple Sinai of Summit, whose Tenth Anniversary was the occasion of this publication. It has been a privilege for me to accompany them over the years to this milestone in our religious journey. To them <em>An Offering of Prayer</em> is dedicated. 

Morrison David Bial
