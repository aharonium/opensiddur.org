<em>Selichot for the Propitiatory and Penitential Days, and for the Minor Fasts, to which are added the Selichot for the Minor Day of Atonement</em> with a New English Translation by David Asher, Ph. Dr. (Vallentine &amp; Sons 1912) is, we believe, the most comprehensive collection of seliḥot with an English translation in the Public Domain.
