Tu biShvat, the New Year for the trees, was designated, following debate in the Talmud, as the time of renewal of budding in the trees. The early winter rains were mostly over, the sap in the trees had risen, and the period of budding was just beginning. The origin of Tu biShvat in the Torah was a time for renewal of our commitment to God and to share the yield of the land with the poor. &quot;Every year, you shall set aside a tenth part of the yield, so that you may learn to revere your God forever.&quot; (Deuteronomy 14.22-23) Today we celebrate Tu biShvat also for renewal of our commitment to serve and protect the trees, and all of God's creation. The evolution of this holiday has an interesting history.

After the exile of the Jews from Israel, Tu biShvat became a day on which to commemorate our connection to Eretz Israel. During much of Jewish history, the only observance of this day was the practice of eating fruit associated with the land of Israel. A tradition based on Deuteronomy 8:8 holds that there are five fruits and two grains associated with it as a &quot;land of wheat and barley, of vines, figs and pomegranates, a land of olive trees and [date] honey.&quot; Almonds were also given a prominent place in Tu biShvat meals since the almond trees were believed to be the first of all trees in Israel to blossom. Carob or St John's bread - was the most popular fruit to use, since it could survive the long trip from Israel to Jewish communities in Europe and North Africa.

The medieval mystical Kabbalists carried Tu biShvat a step further. For them, trees were a symbol of humans, as it says: &quot;For a human is like a tree of the field&quot; (Deut. 20:19). In line with their general concern with Tikun Olam -spiritually repairing the world - the Kabbalists regarded eating a variety of fruits on Tu biShvat as a way of improving our spiritual selves. They believed that the ritual consumption of the fruits and the nuts, if done with the proper intention (kavanah), would cause the sparks of holy light hidden in the fruit to be liberated from their shells and rise up the heavenly ladder to return to their divine source, thereby contributing to the renewal of life for the coming year. The Torah is referred to as a &quot;tree of life to them that hold fast to it.&quot; The Kabbalists pictured their philosophical construct of the Sephirot - the ten mystical emanations of the divinity - in the form of a heavenly tree, or ladder.

For the Kabbalists, trees were symbolic also of <em>the</em> tree - the Tree of Life, which carries divine goodness and blessing into the world. To encourage this flow and effect Tikun Olam, the Kabbalists of Ts'fat (16th century) created a Tu biShvat seder loosely modeled after the Pesach seder.

In the twentieth century, with the growth of Zionism and the founding of the State of Israel, the association of Tu biShvat with the land of Israel has gained even more significance. In Israel, thousands of children plant trees. They play a vital role in the ecological healing of the land that was degraded after centuries of Ottoman rule. In the Diaspora, we give money to the Jewish National Fund for tree planting in Israel. It is also customary to collect money for Ma'ot Peirot - tz'daka for those in need.

In recent decades, the stakes have become much higher. Tu biShvat calls upon us to cry out against the enormity of destruction and degradation being inflicted upon God's world. This degradation includes depletion of our protective ozone layer, global warming, massive deforestation, the extinction of species, poisonous deposits of toxic chemicals and nuclear wastes, and exponential population growth. We are also deeply concerned that the poor suffer disproportionately from environmental degradation. Rabbi Abraham Heschel wrote: &quot;Human beings have indeed become primarily tool-making animals, and the world is now a gigantic tool box for the satisfaction of their needs...&quot;

Tonight we will crack open some shells of nuts, and like the Kabbalists of the 16th century, release some sparks of holy light.

<em>TEHILLIM - PSALMS OF ASCENT</em>
On Tu biShvat it is traditional to read from the fifteen Psalms of Ascent (Shire Hama'alot) which include Psalms 120-134. These were recited as the Levites ascended the fifteen steps to the temple. The fifteen Psalms also remind us of the date of the festival - the fifteenth of Sh'vat - Tu biShvat.

The Tu biShvat seder, like the Passover seder, follows a specific order. The seder is divided into four parts, representing the four worlds of the mystics. As in the Pesach seder, we drink four cups of wine, each cup here changing color to correspond to the changing seasons. Unique to the Tu biShvat seder is the ritual consumption of fifteen types of fruits and nuts, with special significance for the first three of the four worlds. According to kabbalah, the four worlds are: Assiyah (action - our world of physical reality), Y'tzirah (formation), B'riah (creation), and Atzilut (emanation).

The white wine symbolizes the sleep that descends upon nature when the sun's rays begin to weaken. In winter the earth is sometimes barren, covered with snow. In winter we layer ourselves in clothing, blanketing ourselves from the cold just as the earth covered in snow is insulated. The fruit also symbolizes the winter season with its protected outside. Removing the hard shells exposes a fleshy vulnerable inside. The shell which conceals also protects. In the world of work, of everyday activity, the spiritual requires protection and nurturing. Special effort is necessary to protect it from indifference, from being forgotten, from unkind influences.

<em>The branch and the tree</em>

An Israelite in her relationship to the synagogue may be likened to a branch growing on a tree. As long as the branch is still attached to the tree, there is hope it may renew its vigor no matter how withered it has become; but, once the living branch falls away, all hope is lost. So it is with a species - if endangered, there is still hope. Once extinct, all hope is lost. Nachmanides said: Scripture does not permit a destructive act that will cause the extinction of a species.

The date palm abounds in blessing, for every part of it can be used, every part is needed.

The date reminds us of the commandment - Bal Tashḥit - to not waste.
The date is also cause for joy. When Moses heard that the spies had returned, the spies were requested to give their report. They said, &quot;We came unto the land to which you sent us, and surely it flows with milk and honey.&quot; This was not an exaggeration for honey flowed from the date palm trees under which the goats grazed, out of whose udders poured milk, so that both milk and honey moistened the ground.

But in our most precious relationships, we are most like the fruit that are soft throughout and that can be taken whole, available to each other in every aspect and facet of our personalities and strong in a way which does not cut any part of us off from ourselves or from each other. At this moment of I-Thou there is no inner shell, like the fruits of B'riyah. We feel at one with each other and with all creation.

Once when Rav Kook was walking in the fields, lost deep in thought, the young student with him plucked a leaf off a branch. Rav Kook was visibly shaken by this act, and turning to his companion he said gently, &quot;Believe me when I tell you, I never simply pluck a leaf or a blade of grass or any living thing, unless I have to.&quot; He explained further, &quot;Every part of the vegetable world is singing a song and breathing forth a secret of the divine mystery of the Creation.&quot; For the first time the young student understood what it means to show compassion to all creatures.

Master of the Universe, grant me the ability to be alone;

among the trees and grass - among all growing things and there may I be alone, and enter into prayer, to talk with the One to whom I belong.

May I express there everything in my heart, 
and may all the foliage of the field - 
all grasses, trees, and plants - 
awake at my coming, 
to send the powers of their life into the words of my prayer 
so that my prayer and speech are made whole 
through the life and spirit of all growing things, 
which are made as one by their transcendent Source.

May I then pour out the words of my heart

on my behalf, and that of my children!
