When many of us hear the word ‘seder,’ we think ‘Passover.’ The word seder literally means order, and the Passover seder is an orderly ritual.  Why a seder for Tu BiShvat?  Because a seder refers to any ordered ritual that can make an abstract idea tangible and even edible.  On Passover, we don’t just recite the story of liberation and call it a night.  We participate in an elaborate ritual meal to remind us of the journey from bondage to freedom, and we feel it in our bodies.  We become slaves as we eat foods that symbolize slavery.  Matzah represents our poverty; horseradish, our bitterness;  haroset, our occupation as brick layers.  We become free as we eat a lavish feast and drink 4 cups of wine in the style of free people—reclining.

The Tu BiShvat seder is also a ritual that makes an idea tangible and edible. The idea is that God is the source of life—of the extraordinary diversity and richness of the natural world, and it is humanity’s job to help fix the world.

The Tu BiShvat seder has its own order which is based on the symbolism of the Kabbalists, mystics from Safed in medieval Israel. They perceived the universe and our individual universes (our lives) to be structured according to 4 worlds: Assiyah, the physical world of doing, Yetzirah, the emotional world of being/creating, Briyah, the intellectual world of thinking, and Atzilut, the spiritual world of transcending.

The journey of this seder is personal and spiritual. We begin in Assiyah, the material world in which we live—a world of extraordinary variety of color, taste, forms, and sounds—and travel upward (and inward) through the unseen worlds of Yetzirah and Briyah, to the place of Atzilut, the world where all is One. You can imagine the journey as one of pulling back veils or passing through gates. Some Jewish mystics intuited a correspondence between these 4 worlds and the 4 elemental worlds of Earth, Water, Air and Fire. This seder, A New Year for the Trees, is based on this correspondence. Like the Kabbalists, we experience the journey of the 4 worlds by reading from our sacred texts and reflecting on the structure and essence of nature and our nature. And we ingest this journey, making it even more real, as we eat and drink of the specific fruits and wines symbolic of the 4 worlds.

The idea of fixing the world (tikkun) through our blessing is a central theme of the seder.  The Kabbalists believed that before Adam ate the apple in the Garden, the world was whole.  Creation was one with Creator, and peace and harmony prevailed.  Then Adam rebelled against God by eating the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.

The P’ri Etz Hadar states: 

Do not eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, for on the day that you eat of it, you will surely die (Gen. 2:17). By eating from the tree of knowledge [Adam] changed the King’ s laws. [He] abandoned the tree of life in which everything is perfect and upon which faith depends.

From the kabbalistic point of view, Adam’s transgression testifies to the awesome power that humanity holds. It is humanity that is primarily responsible for the state of nature and the cosmos. Just as humanity holds the capacity to spoil the Creation, humanity also holds the possibility to heal and restore it. The world becomes whole when people take seriously the divine law and the obligation to fix the world.

According to the Kabbalists,, nature’s well-being is largely dependent on our kavvanot—the intentions that we hold in our hearts and express in our blessings before partaking of nature’s bounty. In their worldview, the simple act of eating a fruit depletes the plant of the fruit’s divine energy. We can restore the energy by offering a blessing. The plant’s guardian angel channels the blessing back to the specific plant, enabling the plant to bear fruit again. Without our blessings, the angel cannot replenish the energy and the plant cannot produce a second generation of fruit. When we neglect the blessings, we fail to fulfil our obligation as creative agents in the Creation. We are like robbers, stealing the divine energy from the plant.

Blessings can also change us. When we recite a blessing, we subliminally train ourselves to appreciate the gift (the bread, the wine, the rain) that we have been given. The power of this simple act can not be overestimated. We tend to take nature for granted. We have grown to expect that the world is ours to use for our individual gain. We feel entitled to nature’s gifts and live lives of thoughtless consuming. Our souls are poorer for our inability to wonder, and nature suffers on account of our endless need to claim her for ourselves.

It requires a tremendous amount of focus and perseverance to maintain the vision that the world is holy and that our actions towards it matter. Just as we need to practice to learn to play the piano or to speak a new language, we need to practice to learn how to value and treat nature. Blessings are the spiritual practice that can help us to live as sacred guardians of Creation. This practice can help us to care for nature as we care for our souls.

On Tu BiShvat then, our intention is to heal the rift between human and nature that occurred ‘in the beginning’ with Adam’s first act of separation. Just as Adam partook of the tree that God proclaimed was off-limits to him, so we in every generation, invariably overstep our bounds, and partake of that which is not ours. Our blessings on Tu BiShvat have the power to in.uence the world when we recite them with sincere intention. We eat as many kinds of fruit as we can because each new and different kind of fruit is an opportunity for another blessing. The more fruits, the more blessing, the more we can help repair ourselves and the world.

Introductory blessing from the Pri Etz Hadar:

*Please, God who makes, forms, creates, and emanates 
the upper worlds.  
According to their form and character, 
You created the earth below.  
‘You have made all of them with wisdom,’ 
those above and those below, 
to join together the tent as one.  

You cause trees and grass to grow from the earth, 
just like those that grow in heaven above, 
so that human beings might attain wisdom, 
discernment and hidden knowledge.  
You appointed holy angels to oversee their growth.  
And you caused shefa, your heavenly essence, 
to flow upon them. 

May it be Your will O Lord our God 
and God of our ancestors, 
that through the sacred power of eating fruit, 
May we benefit from the heavenly essence 
upon which the fruits depend;  
And may shefa, favor, blessing, 
and bounty be bestowed upon them.  

May their guardian angels 
be filled by Your abundance; 
may the shefa return  
and cause the fruits to grow again, 
from the beginning of the year until the end, 
for bounty and blessing,  for good life and for peace.   

Look down from Your sacred dwelling place in heaven 
and bless us this [new] year with bounty and blessing. 
May all the holy sparks  which were dispersed 
by us and by our ancestors and by Adam 
[when he ate the fruit of the tree] 
now be reunited in the splendid power.

Why celebrate the trees’ new year in winter? 

Tu BiShvat, literally the 15th of Sh’vat, occurs in the heart of winter, just as the earth is starting to thaw. The trees draw up water through their roots, and begin to bud.  

Tu BiShvat is a celebration, not only, of the trees— 
but also of  the waters, upon which they depend. 
It is a celebration of the tree of life, 
and the interdependence of all of nature.

Assiyah literally means ‘making’ or ‘doing.’ 

Kabbalistically speaking, 
it is the world of the physical, the embodied. 
It is the world that we can see and touch. 
It corresponds to earth, the element of form, 
substance, solidity, permanence and security.

The kabbalists said, *‘It is a good to eat an abundance of fruit on this day and to sing their praises.’ Today we eat many fruits, deepening our gratitude for the diversity of trees and all nature. 

Before we eat, we pause to bless. “Blessing” is Judaism’s most important discipline. By blessing, eating becomes a spiritual experience.   

For Assiyah, we eat fruits —hard outside and soft within—to remind us of the earth’s protective nature. We acknowledge our dependence on earth, both physically

The Hebrew letter “mem” comes from mayim, meaning water. 
“Mem” represents the mikvah, the ritual bath, and the womb.  
The word, Mah, “What?” also begins with the letter mem. 
When a person immerses in water, 
she nullifies her ego and asks, “What am I?”  
Ego is the essence of permanence, 
while water is the essence of impermanence.  
When a person is ready to replace her ego with a question, 
she is ready to be reborn with its answer.

The establishment of Everglades National Park in 1947 marked the first time in American history that a large tract of wilderness was permanently protected, not for its scenic value (many had deemed it a swamp), but for the bene.t of the unique diversity of life it sustained. The habitats within the Everglades support an array of plant and animal species found nowhere else on the planet. More than 360 species of birds inhabit this watery paradise.

By the 1900s, when plumed hats were the rage, the snowy white feathers of the egrets that lived in the Everglades had become more valuable than gold. More than five million birds a year were slaughtered; nearly 95 percent of Florida's shore birds butchered. The Audubon Society tried unsuccessfully to dissuade women from buying hats with feathers, but the powerful millinery industry in.uenced Congress to defeat national laws that would halt the killing.

With strong hearts, we can let go of our protective outer shells,

In Arabic, the wind is ‘ruh,’ but the same word also means ‘breath’ and ‘spirit,’while in Hebrew, ‘ruach’ includes concepts of creation and divinity.  And the Greek ‘pneuma,’ or the Latin ‘animus’ are redolent, not just of air, but of the very stuff of the soul. 

Without wind, most of the earth would be uninhabitable.  The tropics would grow so unbearably hot that nothing could live there, and the rest of the planet would freeze.  Moisture—if any existed—would be confined to the oceans, and all but the fringe of the great continents, would be desert. . .  

But with the wind, Earth comes truly alive.  
Winds provide the circulatory and nervous systems of the planet, sharing energy and information, distributing both warmth and awareness, 
making something out of nothing.
