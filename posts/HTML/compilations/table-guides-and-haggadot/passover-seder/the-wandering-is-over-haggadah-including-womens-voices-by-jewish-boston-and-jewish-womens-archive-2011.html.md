Tonight we gather together to celebrate Passover, our holiday of freedom. We will eat a great meal together, enjoy four glasses (at least!) of wine, and tell the story of our ancestors’ liberation from slavery in Egypt. We welcome our friends and family members from other backgrounds to reflect with us on the meaning of freedom in all our lives and histories. We will consider the blessings in our lives, pledge to work harder at freeing those who still suffer, and begin to cast off the things in our own lives that oppress us.

Gertrude Weil’s passion for equality and justice shaped the course of her long life. Inspired by Jewish teachings that ʺjustice, mercy, [and] goodness were not to be held in a vacuum, but practiced in our daily lives,ʺ Weil stood courageously at the forefront of a wide range of progressive and often controversial causes. From the 1910s, when she campaigned for women’s suffrage, to the 1960s, when she convened interracial meetings in her North Carolina home; from championing child labor legislation to creating parks and pools in underprivileged African‐American neighborhoods; from teaching religious school to helping rescue Jewish refugees in the 1930s and 1940s, she worked to make her community a place that offered equal opportunity, dignity, and respect to all its residents.

Water is refreshing, cleansing, and clear, so it’s easy to understand why so many cultures and religions use water for symbolic purification. We will wash our hands twice during our seder: now, with no blessing, to get us ready for the rituals to come; and then again later, we’ll wash again with a blessing, preparing us for the meal, which Judaism thinks of as a ritual in itself.

The Haggadah doesn’t tell the story of Passover in a linear fashion. We don’t hear of Moses being found by the daughter of Pharaoh – actually, we don’t hear much of Moses at all. Instead, we get an impressionistic collection of songs, images, and stories of both the Exodus from Egypt and from Passover celebrations through the centuries. Some say that minimizing the role of Moses keeps us focused on the miracles God performed for us. Others insist that we keep the focus on the role that every member of the community has in bringing about positive change.

The formal telling of the story of Passover is framed as a discussion with lots of questions and answers. The tradition that the youngest person asks the questions reflects the centrality of involving everyone in the seder. The rabbis who created the set format for the seder gave us the Four Questions to help break the ice in case no one had their own questions. Asking questions is a core tradition in Jewish life. If everyone at your seder is around the same age, perhaps the person with the least seder experience can ask them – or everyone can sing them all together.

The Passover story is most often associated with the leadership of Moses, but in fact the cycle of protest that culminated in the Exodus from Egypt began with the courageous acts of two women who disobeyed Pharaoh’s decree to murder all Hebrew male babies born in Egypt. These women, Shifra and Puah, practiced a bold and noteworthy profession—midwifery. It was their commitment to preserving human life and their skills as midwives that provided the safe and secret delivery of Hebrew baby boys.

During a visit to Oberlin College in the early 1980s, she read a feminist Haggadah that called for placing a piece of bread on the seder plate as a symbol of the need to include gays and lesbians in Jewish life. Heschel liked the idea of putting something new on the seder plate to represent suppressed voices, but she was uncomfortable with using chametz, which she felt would invalidate the very ritual it was meant to enhance. She chose instead to add an orange and to interpret it as a symbol of all marginalized populations.

Like many other immigrants from Eastern Europe, Clara Lemlich found work in one of New York City’s garment shops.

From her first day on the job, Lemlich found working conditions in the garment factory intolerable. She soon started to organize her fellow workers into an all‐female chapter of the recently formed International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union. She led her co‐workers on strike several times. In 1909, her call to action set off the general strike of garment workers known as the “Uprising of the 20,000,” which transformed the American labor movement. Throughout her life, her activist spirit never wavered. In her eighties, she helped her nursing home’s orderlies form a union and persuaded the home’s administrators to participate in the United Farm Workers grape boycott.

When the Temple stood in Jerusalem, the biggest ritual of them all was eating the lamb offered as the pesach or Passover sacrifice. The great sage Hillel would put the meat in a sandwich made of matzah, along with some of the bitter herbs. While we do not make sacrifices any more – and, in fact, some Jews have a custom of purposely avoiding lamb during the seder so that it is not mistaken as a sacrifice – we honor this custom by eating a sandwich of the remaining matzah and bitter herbs. Some people will also include charoset in the sandwich to remind us that God’s kindness helped relieve the bitterness of slavery.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg was born in 1933 in Brooklyn, NY. She earned a scholarship to Cornell, where she graduated first in her class. She attended Harvard and then Columbia Law Schools, making law review at each and again graduating at the top of her class. Despite her record of achievement, Ginsburg still had great difficulty finding a job as a lawyer upon graduation due to discrimination she faced as a woman. However, she eventually went on to become the first tenured female professor at Columbia Law School. She also took on many cases involving issues of gender discrimination. In 1981, President Jimmy Carter appointed her to the D.C. Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. Two years later, President Clinton made Ginsburg his first appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court. When she was sworn in on August 10, 1993, she became the second woman, and the first Jewish woman, to serve on the Supreme Court.

If Hallel is traditionally a time to sing songs in praise of God, what better song to sing than “Miriam’s Song,” which recalls the jubilant dancing and singing of Israelite women led by Miriam after the miracle at the Red Sea. The singer‐songwriter Debbie Friedman (1951‐2011) gave Miriam the Prophet new life with this song, bringing women and girls of all ages to their feet to celebrate Miriam’s leadership. Friedman transformed American Jewish liturgy and music by taking prayers, stories, and texts from the tradition and making them accessible through her contemporary, folky songs, which have been so fully integrated into synagogue practice as to be considered “traditional” by many. Friedman recorded more than 20 albums and performed her music around the world, in venues as lofty as Carnegie Hall and as informal as summer camp dining halls. Though she died an untimely death in January 2011, her music continues to resonate through the sanctuaries of synagogues world‐wide.

Grace Paley, feminist author and activist, was born on December 11, 1922, in the Bronx. She wrote three highly acclaimed collections of short fiction, as well as three books of poetry, and taught at the City College of New York, Sarah Lawrence, and Dartmouth. Raised by socialist parents who had fled persecution in Czarist Russia, at a young age Paley began taking progressive stands and expressing concern for the underdog. Her career as a political activist began in her native New York, but she was involved for many decades in the national anti‐war, anti‐nuclear, and feminist movements. In 1986, Governor Mario Cuomo made Paley the first official New York State Writer. Her work gives voice to ordinary women, many of whom are Jewish, and illuminates the nature of everyday life and the intricacies of relationships, love, family, and community.
