This Haggadah was created specifically for a seder that took place April 20, 2014 outside the White House as an act of solidarity with the #not1more deportation campaign hunger strikers. While it is created for a seder without food, in a cross cultural setting, framed around the issue of deportation, there are many gems that can be adapted to work for any seder. This is a work of love. We hope you enjoy, use, and share! We would love to hear from you! Email us at jewssayno2deportation@gmail.com to get in touch or to share how you adapt it for your community.

<h3>Why a Seder in Solidarity with Hunger Strikers fighting deportation?</h3>
Everyday, more than 1,000 people are deported from the U.S.: torn apart from family, community and loved ones. By the end of this month, two million people will have been deported by the Obama Administration, amid Congressional inaction on Comprehensive Immigration Reform. The President can take concrete, bold and necessary actions to turn back the deportation dragnet but thus far, has not taken action.

In communities all across the country, people have been putting their bodies on the line, using nonviolent civil disobedience to stop deportation buses, shut down deportation centers, and put an end to this unjust and racist system that is destroying lives and tearing families apart. In April, migrant justice leaders from local struggles across the country convened in DC to ensure the president heard their demands loud and clear. Family members of those in deportation proceedings went on hunger strike outside the White House to emphasize the urgency of their message.

As Jews, this travesty hits close to home: it is not too long ago in our history that we were unwelcome in the places we called home. During Passover, we celebrate our freedom from bondage in Egypt under Pharaoh. Today in the U.S., undocumented communities face a parallel state of enslavement at the hands of ICE (Immigration Customs Enforcement) and local law enforcement. Families live in a constant state of fear that at any moment they could be separated through deportation, as a result of state sanctioned racial profiling. Undocumented workers, often silenced with the threat of being reported to ICE, face stolen wages and abuse in the workplace. Domestic violence goes unreported and unchecked in an environment where police are required to detain victims and collude with ICE. Individuals caught reentering the country are charged with felonies, tried en masse, and sentenced to months or years in jail while the private prison industry rakes in taxpayer money.

<h3>Set Up</h3>
Knowing we would not have a physical table to sit around, we wanted to create a container to hold the space. We placed a traditional seder plate with traditional items in the center, on top of a large piece of fabric cut in a circle, with our talisses placed around the fabric. This created a central table we could all gather around. Before hand, we asked participants to bring a piece of fabric and an item that represents liberation to them. Upon arrival, they were asked to cut their piece of fabric into a circle, place it on the large piece of fabric in front of their seat, and place their item on it. This represented their plate, or place, at the table.

<h3>Ritualized use of food</h3>
<em>Leader:</em> A Seder is a ritual meal carried out in a specific order. Jewish tradition commands us to eat an abundant meal to mark holidays, requiring of us an abundance of food beyond what we would eat on a typical day. A hunger strike is also a highly ritualized use of food. It is the act of not eating as a tool of protest, placing the value of ones life on the line in pursuit of justice. For our Seder today will not eat as a tool of marking this overlapping moment of Passover and the #not1more hunger strike.

<h3>A Stand Against All Forms Of Oppression</h3>
<em>Leader:</em> We are gathered here with people targeted by many forms of oppression- racism, imperialism, classism, anti-Semitism, US dominance, capitalism. To firmly take a stand against present-day oppression towards Arab Americans and western imperialism in the Middle East, we will be using the Hebrew word mitzrayim in place of Egypt, to intentionally differentiate between the symbolic and ancient oppressors in the Passover story and contemporary Arab places or people. Mitzrayim is the word used throughout the Torah to mean the land of Egypt. It comes from the Hebrew word zar, meaning narrow or constricted. The Passover story is also the story of the birth of the Jewish people, and mitzrayim is the narrow passage we moved through. Leaving mitzrayim also means freeing ourselves from narrow- mindedness and oppression.

<em>1. Who are the Jewish people?</em>
“Jews are a people with a common early history that has developed uninterrupted for more than 3000 years. They have developed a number of distinctive cultures in the many lands in which they have lived...Jews are not a race. They are members of every race and have been citizens of many nations….nothing genetic determines Jewishness.” (JLPS, 2011) There are Jews by choice, Jews of mixed faith families, Jews through adoption, and Jews by birth.

<em>2. Is it true Jews control the economy, run politics and the media?</em>
No. Throughout history,” the roles that some Jews played as officials, administrators, etc. [ie middle agent roles] placed the entire Jewish community in a visible and vulnerable position in relation to other oppressed peoples. The latter were encouraged to direct hatred and resentment of their socioeconomic difficulties against the Jews rather than their actual oppressors, the ruling classes.” (JLPS, 2011) Today, we see this to continue to be played by perceptions of who run the media, politics, and the economy. “The largest concentration of people in the ruling class by far are Christian, not Jewish - and even the wealthiest Jews have often been excluded from top levels of decision making.” (Paul Kivel, in Rosenwasser)

<em>3. Aren’t all Jews white and wealthy?</em>
Again, no. Jews are of all races and come from most all corners of the world. And no, not all Jews are wealthy. 1 in every 10 Jews are Jews of color. As we said above, it is in the interest of those in power to paint the picture that Jews are all wealthy. In the early 2000s, the Jewish median household income was $54,000 and 1/6th of Jews in the U.S. are low income.

<em>4. Do all Jews support Israel?</em>
There are a wide range of views on Israel, Zionism, and concepts of Jewish home within the Jewish community. In today’s political climate, there is little space for Jews to take firm stands against the injustices being carried out by the Israeli government while maintaining a clear commitment to the Jewish people’s right to a home. This right belongs to all peoples and is not inherently in conflict with any other peoples.

<h4>Four presumptuous questions relating to people who are undocumented in the U.S.</h4>
<em>1. Why don’t people come here legally, like many of our ancestors did?</em>
Under current policy, the immigrant ancestors of many citizens today, who arrived between 1790 and 1924, would not be allowed in today. Generally, gaining permission to live and work in the United States is limited to people who are (1) highly trained in a skill that is in short supply here, (2) escaping political persecution, or (3) joining close family already here. For many, there is no legal path offered. (Tolerance.org)

<em>2. Do undocumented people take “our” jobs?</em>
This is not the question that we should be asking. Our current economic system exploits workers without documents, which in turn lowers the standards for health, safety and wage protection for all workers. The question we should be asking is: how can we create an economic system that is just and fair for all workers? In addition, the concept of jobs being “ours” and not “theirs” is faulty. It is based on a sense of entitlement to land and a belief that who gets access to citizenship is based in justice rather than the reality that it is deeply rooted in racism and the reaches of global capitalism.

<em>3. Is it true undocumented people don’t pay taxes and then receive government benefits?</em>
No. Undocumented people pay property and sales tax, and often either have taxes withheld from their paycheck, and/or file taxes with an ITIN #. Though they do pay taxes, they are not able to receive government benefits because in order to receive them, one is required to show a valid SS# and undocumented people do not have this. This means that often, people pay into social security benefits that they will never receive.

<em>4. Why don’t people just stay in the countries they came from?</em>
Many countries have been negatively impacted by economic decisions imposed on them by the US Government. Many people are forced out of their countries because of poverty caused by global economic decisions. For example: prior to NAFTA, corn was a staple crop for Mexican farmers. However, after NAFTA came into effect, the U.S. subsidies for soy and corn flooded Mexican markets with cheaper products, putting thousands of Mexican farmers out of business

<h4>The Story of Exodus:</h4>
According to the Torah, one of Jacob’s sons, Joseph came to live in Mitzrayim and became the Pharoah’s advisor. He told Pharoah to build storehouses and fill them with grain. Years later, famine struck and there was food to eat in Mitzrayim. The Pharoah was so grateful that when Joseph’s brothers came in search of food, he invited them to settle. They lived there in peace for many years and became known as Israelites.

Customarily, we spill 10 drops of wine in order to recognize the suffering that non-Jews living in Mitzrayim faced from the 10 plagues. There are many contemporary renditions written of these plagues including those below. However, another way to view the plagues is that they were tactics used by G-d and Moses to put pressure on Pharaoh to achieve freedom from slavery. Therefore, today we also recognize the plagues of liberation, the many tactics that are being used today to unfreeze the hearts of ICE, President Obama and Congress.

<h4>“This Time” by Aurora Levins Morales</h4>
They say that other country over there, dim blue in the twilight, farther than the orange stars exploding over our roofs, is called peace, but who can find a way?
This time we cannot cross until we carry each other.
All of us refugees, all of us prophets. No more taking turns on history’s wheel trying to collect old debts no one can pay.
The sea will not open that way.
This time that country is what we promise each other, our rage pressed cheek to cheek until tears flood the space between, until there are no enemies left, because this time no one will be left to drown, and all of us must be chosen.
This time it’s all of us, or none.
