(Charoset is a delicious paste made of chopped fruit, chopped nuts, wine or grape juice, and spices such as cinnamon, and nutmeg. There are many variations and recipes beyond this basic formula.)

Half a millennium later, the Prophet Muhammad—like Moses—fled his city of oppression, learned to be a shepherd of the people, and returned to transform the city of Mecca into a place of justice. His followers today still walk that path of pilgrimage to Mecca: 
<blockquote>“Before entering the Hajj (Pilgrimage) which is the beginning of a great change and revolution, you must declare your intention. It is the intention of a ‘transferral’ from your house to the house of the people, from life to love, from the self to God, from slavery to freedom, from racial discrimination to equality, sincerity and truth, from being clothed to being naked, from a daily life to an eternal life and from selfishness and aimlessness to devotion and responsibility.” (Ali Shariati, Hajj)</blockquote>

Hasten to bake it without time for the bread to rise, For then we lived and now we live, as Dr. King taught, in the “fierce urgency of NOW!”—swiftly moving toward our liberation.”

“Unleavened bread is the leveler that raises us all to the same lofty height. Outside, the battle rages between the haves and have-nots, between those who have more and those who have less. Too often the struggle for daily bread is attended by feverish competition, tension and trauma. But at this most egalitarian of banquets, bread of the most unpretentious kind is a common denominator that makes all people one.”  (Jewish Labor Committee)

“Our only hope today lies in our ability to recapture the revolutionary spirit and go out into a sometimes hostile world declaring eternal hostility to poverty, racism, and militarism.

“In the ancient past, the Plagues interrupted the flow of food and drink to human beings and other life-forms. In the present as well, there are Plagues that disrupt the flow of food and drink from species to species, Earth to human earthlings. And so today we mark our Plagues by interrupting the food and drink that embody our Seder.

“Every single person up here today, all these people should be home grieving. But instead we are up here standing together because if all our government and President can do is send thoughts and prayers, then it's time for victims to be the change that we need to see. We certainly do not understand why it should be harder to make plans with friends on weekends than to buy an automatic or semi-automatic weapon. 

“We are going to be the kids you read about in textbooks. Because we are going to be the last mass shooting. We are going to change the law. Iit's going to be due to the tireless effort of the school board, the faculty members, the family members and most of all the students. The students who are dead, the students still in the hospital, the student now suffering PTSD, the students who had panic attacks during the vigil because the helicopters would not leave us alone, hovering over the school for 24 hours a day.

“If the President wants to come up to me and tell me to my face that it was a terrible tragedy and how it should never have happened and maintain telling us how nothing is going to be done about it, I'm going to happily ask him how much money he received from the National Rifle Association.”  (Emma  Gonzalez, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, February 17, 2018)

“A genuine revolution of values means in the final analysis that our loyalties must become ecumenical rather than sectional. Every nation must now develop an overriding loyalty to humankind as a whole in order to preserve the best in their individual societies.

“This call for a world-wide fellowship that lifts neighborly concern beyond one's tribe, race, class and nation is in reality a call for an all-embracing and unconditional love for all life.

“Love has now become an absolute necessity for the survival of humanity. 

“We can no longer afford to worship the god of hate or bow before the altar of retaliation. History is cluttered with the wreckage of nations and individuals that pursued this self-defeating path of hate. 

“We are confronted with the fierce urgency of now.”
