This is an abridged translation by Hesther Rothschild in 1855 titled אמרי לב Prayers and Meditations, adapted from <em><a href="https://opensiddur.org/compilations/sifrei-tehinot/imrei-lev-prieres-dun-coeur-israelite-by-jonas-ennery-and-arnaud-aron-1848/">Prières d’un Cœur Israelite</a></em> published by the “Société Consistoriale de Bons Livres” (1848). The original work by Rabbi Arnaud Aron and Jonas Ennery contains tkhines translated into French, prayers by German reformers in French translation, and many additional liturgical translations and paraliturgical prayers. Rothschild's work presents several prayers in English unique to her compilation by Anglo-Jewish writers.

This second edition (1859) contains revisions and corrections ("there are some additions and many improvements"). This second edition was also later republished without permission in the United States by <a href="https://opensiddur.org/compilations/sifrei-tehinot/imrei-lev-meditations-and-prayers-for-every-situation-and-occasion-in-life-translated-by-isaac-leeser-1863/">Isaac Leeser</a> containing additional corrections.

<strong>[Hester Rothschild's preface to her English translation of אמרי לב (1855):]</strong>

The following pages are translated and adapted from a little volume in French, entitled <em><a href="https://opensiddur.org/compilations/sifrei-tehinot/imrei-lev-prieres-dun-coeur-israelite-by-jonas-ennery-and-arnaud-aron-1848/">Prières d'un Cœur Israélite</a></em> published by the Société Consistoriale de Bons Havre [in 1848].

In its present form the work is not intended to be used in place of, but as a companion to, the Jewish ritual, to be referred to during the periods of public service when the congregation is not actually employed in prayer, or in receiving pulpit instruction; so that, combined with our sacred ceremonies, it may tend to inspire devotion, and direct the attention to holy thoughts.

It is likewise designed as an aid to domestic and individual worship. We all feel the want of pouring forth the soul's emotions of joy or sorrow by communion with the Universal Father; general public forms of prayer may not always be adapted to the peculiar exigencies of every mind; the compilers of this work have therefore striven to supply in some measure this spiritual need, by meditations and prayers suited to every situation and occasion in life; and it has been the humble yet anxious endeavour of the translator to preserve the spirit of the original in its English garb. But, as the genius of the French language differs so widely from that of our own, a mere translation of phrases would render this impossible; it has often been found necessary, therefore, to arrange the same ideas in a very different order and form of language to the original, and even sometimes to remodel them altogether; thus this little volume frequently partakes of the character of an adaptation.

Having ventured these remarks in apology for the deviations from the original, the translator trusts the public will receive with lenient judgment this result of the employment of some leisure hours; and if the use of these pages produce but to one member of the Hebrew family anything like the soul's satisfaction and comfort that have been derived from this “labour of love,” the translator will deem it an ample reward.

<strong>Advertisement to the Second Edition</strong>

In offering a Second Edition of אמרי לב Prayers and Meditations to the Anglo-Jewish public, I must remark, that it has been carefully revised and corrected; there are some additions, and likewise, as I hope the reader will consider, many improvements, for which I am indebted to the grammatical and critical knowledge of the Rev. Isaac H. Myers, of Ramsgate, to whom I take this opportunity of presenting my grateful acknowledgments, for his friendly and valuable assistance in the progress of this work. Having received many encouraging assurances that good has resulted from the first fruits of my labour, I am induced to hope that the seeds now sown may be equally productive.
