Join us in creating a faithful digital transcription of the <a href="http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A4%D7%AA%D7%97:Seligman_Baer_-_Seder_Avodat_Yisroel_(1901_ed.).pdf"><em>Seder Avodat Yisrael</em></a> (Isaac Seligman Baer, 1868), a critical text of the nusaḥ Ashkeanaz.

<em>Seder Avodat Yisroel</em> was originally published in 1868 by the Rödelheim printing press. The edition we are transcribing is from 1901. <em>Avodat Yisrael</em> is respected as a carefully edited work. Its sources are cited in the introduction, and Baer's commentary frequently explains his choice of text among the variants in his source manuscripts. Its text forms the basis for many of the 20th century's Ashkenazic <em>siddurim</em> (including the Singer Siddur, whose translation we have already transcribed). Its extensive commentary is frequently quoted in academic studies of the Jewish liturgy.

In December 2009, we received <a href="https://opensiddur.org/set-prayers/siddurim/ashkenaz/nusah-ashkenaz-minhag-frankfurt-am-main-as-transcribed-from-seder-avodat-yisrael-seligman-baer-1868-by-gabriel-wasserman/">transcription</a> which Gabriel Wasserman transcribed for his <em>Machzor l'Shabbat Hanukkah</em>. Integrating Wasserman's transcription into this transcription effort should save us some time.

After transcription and proofreading, this new digital edition will be shared under a Creative Commons Zero (CC0) Public Domain dedication. The edition will then be encoded in TEI XML and archived in the <a href="http://app.opensiddur.org">Open Siddur database</a>, a <em>libre</em> Open Access liturgy database.
