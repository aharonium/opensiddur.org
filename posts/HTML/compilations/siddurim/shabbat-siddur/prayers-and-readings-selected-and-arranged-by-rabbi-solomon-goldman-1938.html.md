PREFACE 

I have compiled this Song Book with the hope of adding to the beauty and joy of Jewish assemblies-religious and otherwise. I availed myself of as many sources as are known to me, and selected the material which I found to be merit and suited for popular use. I have no doubt that many a student of Jewish Music will be missing some of his favorite songs, but I was guided by my own experience, by the limitations of space and the cost of production. The classifications of the songs need not be strictly adhered to, they are merely suggestions. In the transliteration from the Hebrew, I employed the system which I have found most usable. It is to be regretted that there is as yet no universal system of transliteration. 

I am greatly indebted to the many composers and compilers listed at the end of this book, whose works made this Songster possible. I am also under obligation to the thousands of children and adults who, for many years, permitted me to experiment and test these songs on them; to my friends of the Board of Jewish Education, Chicago-particularly Mr. Hyman Reznick; and to my wife who laboured indefatiguably in the preparation of this collection. Finally-this book is in large measure due to the constant encouragement, guidance, deep love for Jewish music, and material assistance of Rabbi Solomon Goldman.

PREFACE 


My friend and colleague Mr. Harry Coopersmith asked me to select some prayers and readings to accompany his Songster. I hesitated for a long time to comply with his request. A Reader for the Synagogue should be prepared by our most inspired Hebrew writers. Some day Eretz Yisrael will give us the old Siddur revised and enlarged. But Mr. Coopersmith was insistent and I yielded. 

I selected my material from the following sources: 

[su_row]

The traditional liturgy 
Miriam Del Banco 
Bialik 
Brandeis 
Byron 
Jacob Cohen 
Deuteronomy 
Ecclesiastes

Ezekiel 
Yehuda Halevi 
Avigdor Ham’iri

[/su_column]
[/su_row]


I availed myself of translations by Mr. Maurice Samuel, Mr. L. V. Snowman, and Mr. Harry H. Fein. Several of the translations from the modern Hebrew were done by Mr. Ben Aronin and myself. I have also translated one of the selections from Heine, and one from Renan. Of the selection from Professor Einstein, I preferred the translation in Doctor Lewisohn’s “Rebirth,” to the one which appeared in “Cosmic Religion.” 

Following medieval precedent I took considerable liberty in the arrangement of Biblical verses. I have, for example, not hesitated to add a verse from Isaiah to a chapter from the Psalms. Technical and financial reasons made it necessary to exclude many a passage which has brought me personally solace and inspiration. But Mr. Coopersmith and I regard this book an experiment. 

The selections are arranged under the following headings: 

God 
Torah 
Israel 
Zion 
The Synagogue 
The Sabbath and Festivals 
The Sorrow-Laden Heart 
The Troubled Spirit 
The Faithful Soul 
The Arrogant Tyrant 
In the End of Days 

A Complete Service for Sabbath and Festivals will be found on pages 57a to 235a. I have nowhere designated special passages for responsive reading, but almost all of the selections can be utilized for the purpose. 

I am under great obligation to Miss Esther R. Greenburg and Mrs. A. E. Kanter for the pains they took in preparing the manuscript for publication. Without the help of my friend, Professor Samuel I. Feigen of the University of Chicago, this book could not now make its appearance.
