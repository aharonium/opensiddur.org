Siman L'vanim ("<a href="https://library.yctorah.org/2016/09/how-far-can-the-apple-land-from-the-tree/">a sign to the children</a>") is a birkon/bentsher (blessing-book) prepared in celebration of the wedding of Honi Sanders and Simona Dalin on July 7th, 2019. The birkon contains versions of the birkat hamazon common to both Sefaradi and Ashkenazi communities. The translation and transliteration of the Sefaradi nusaḥ follows that of Hazzan Isaac Azose. The translation and transliteration of the Ashkenazi nusaḥ was prepared by Aharon Varady of <a href="https://dimus.parrhesia.press">Dimus Parrhessia Press</a> who also designed the bentsher.

The birkon also contains translations of zemirot by Reb Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, z"l, from his Tehillat Hashem Yedaber Pi sabbath supplement, new translations by Honi and Akiva Sanders, and translations adapted by Aharon Varady from his <a href="https://opensiddur.org/compilations/shabbat-siddur/siddur-livnat-hasapir-lkabbalat-shabbat-friday-night-siddur/">Siddur Livnat haSapir</a> (Dimus Parrhesia Press 2017).
