Compiled and translated by Paltiel (Philip) Birnbaum, the bilingual Hebrew-English <em>Maḥzor ha-Shalem l'Rosh ha-Shanah v'Yom Kippur</em> (Ashkenaz, 1951) was the first mahzor Paltiel arranged following the publication of his siddur in 1949 by the Hebrew Publishing Co. A two volume set of "sephardic" (nusah ha-ARI z"l) mahzorim were later published in 1958.

This maḥzor entered the Public Domain due to lack of copyright renewal by the copyright owner listed in the copyright notice, the Hebrew Publishing Co. The storied publishing house became defunct in 2016 when its latest owner, <a href="https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/nytimes/obituary.aspx?n=charles-lieber&pid=179665968">Charles Lieber</a>, passed away. (Works published from 1964 onward carry on the copyright of the Hebrew Publishing Co. as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphan_work">orphan works</a>.")

Making digital images of these works available is the first step in our process of making the entire prayerbook, both Hebrew liturgy and English translation, machine-readable (copy-pastable and searchable).
