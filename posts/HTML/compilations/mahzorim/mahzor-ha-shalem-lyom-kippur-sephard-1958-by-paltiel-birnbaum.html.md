Compiled and translated by Paltiel (Philip) Birnbaum, the bilingual Hebrew-English <em>Maḥzor ha-Shalem l'Yom Kippur</em> ("Sephardic-Ḥasidic," 1958) was part of a two volume set of mahzorim Paltiel arranged following the publication of his Ashkenaz mahzor for Rosh ha-Shanah and Yom Kippur in 1951 (also published by the Hebrew Publishing Co.).

"Sephardic" here does not refer to the liturgical custom of the Sepharadim, but rather to the liturgical custom of the ḥasidim who followed the school of Lurianic Kabbalah (a/k/a the nusaḥ ha-ARI z"l). Non-ḥasidic Jews referred to this "new" liturgical custom as "Sephardic" as it contained some liturgical customs familiar to some branches of the sepharadi diaspora. The term stuck and has been a familiar source of confusion for newcomers to Jewish prayer ever since.

This maḥzor entered the Public Domain due to lack of copyright renewal by the copyright owner listed in the copyright notice, the Hebrew Publishing Co. The storied publishing house became defunct in 2016 when its latest owner, <a href="https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/nytimes/obituary.aspx?n=charles-lieber&pid=179665968">Charles Lieber</a>, passed away. (Works published from 1964 onward carry on the copyright of the Hebrew Publishing Co. as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphan_work">orphan works</a>.")

Making digital images of this maḥzor is the first step in our process of making the entire prayerbook, both Hebrew liturgy and English translation, machine-readable (copy-pastable and searchable).
