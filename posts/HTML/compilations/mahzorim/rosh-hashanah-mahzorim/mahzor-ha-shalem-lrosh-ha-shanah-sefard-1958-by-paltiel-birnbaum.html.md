Compiled and translated by Paltiel (Philip) Birnbaum, the bilingual Hebrew-English <em>Maḥzor ha-Shalem l'Rosh ha-Shanah</em> ("Sephardic-Ḥasidic," 1958) was part of a two volume set of maḥzorim Paltiel arranged following the publication of his Ashkenaz maḥzor for Rosh ha-Shanah and Yom Kippur in 1951 (also published by the Hebrew Publishing Co.).

"Sephardic" here does not refer to the liturgical custom of the Sepharadim, but rather to the liturgical custom of the ḥassidim who followed the school of Lurianic Kabbalah (a/k/a the nusaḥ ha-ARI z"l). Non-ḥassidic Jews referred to this "new" liturgical custom as "Sephardic" as it contained some liturgical customs familiar to some branches of the sepharadi diaspora. The term stuck and has been a familiar source of confusion for newcomers to Jewish prayer ever since.
