As we move not just toward a new “year” (<em>shanah</em>) but toward a moment when repetition  (<em>sheni</em>) becomes transformation (<em>shinui</em>), I hope we will remember --

the roots of Jewish renewal in the upheavals of the 1960s as well as the upheavals of the 1760s,

the roots of Judaism in the great "political" speeches of the Prophets,

and the teachings of Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, who said that in a great civil rights march  his legs were praying, and who argued again and again that "spirituality" and "politics" cannot be severed.

As Heschel also said, "Prayer is meaningless unless it is subversive."[foot]Full quote from Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel (August 1969, National Liturgical Conference, Milwaukee Wisconsin): "Prayer is meaningless unless it is subversive, unless it seeks to overthrow and to ruin the pyramids of callousness, hatred, opportunism, falsehoods. The liturgical movement must become a revolutionary movement seeking to overthrow the forces that continue to destroy the promise, the hope, the vision." See p. 262 ff. of <em>Moral Grandeur and Spiritual Audacity</em>, ed. by Susannah Heschel.[/foot]

I often introduce the Isaiah haftarah with a great short-short story by Franz Kafka.[foot]See his wonderful and troubling book of midrash, PARABLES AND PARADOXES.[/foot]  More or less, the story goes:

<blockquote>One day a leopard stalked into the synagogue, roaring and lashing its tail. Three weeks later, it had become part of the liturgy.</blockquote>

What can we do to un-tame the leopard -- let God off the leash of the liturgy?

What, for example,  can we do for Yom Kippur -- and for all those other times when the religiously or spiritually committed begin to think they can get high on God without gittin' down with the lowest of the low?

On Yom Kippur morning, we read a prophetic passage of Isaiah, describing what happened when he interrupted the prayers and fasting of a crowd that thought it was fulfilling its religious obligations.

Isaiah seems to be saying that he actually walked into the crowd of some large Yom Kippur assemblage.

He faced people who were feeling good because they were feeling bad (having fasted for 18 hours or so). He shouted at them that it was all beside the point. He sneered at their "<em>drooping their heads like bullrushes</em>." He demanded that they pay attention to the poor, to those in prison, and also to their own scrabbling for wealth.

He notes that on the holy day itself, as they heard his words, they shook their fists at him. (They were probably angry because he was interrupting the beautiful songs the Levites were singing.)

He insists that the "high" they were feeling when he arrived was a fake: they can have a real high, real ecstasy, only by lifting the lowest of their community along with them. By actual material acts of feeding, clothing, liberating.

He shattered the traditional liturgy, he shattered the equanimity of those spiritual folks, he denied the authenticity of their experience. He did not have a civil debate with them.

And this is the text the rabbis set before us to read on the very day when the community is most likely to be feeling exactly as Isaiah's crowd did.

But in many many synagogues, this passage itself has become just a set piece for recitation, just another part of the liturgy. So I have tried over and over to invent ways to read it in such a fashion, with "interruptions" from the real world, that it can shake people as it is supposed to.

I have interrupted the verses of Isaiah with  headlines about homeless people freezing to death on Philadelphia streets. About 300 jobless people applying for work when only ten jobs were advertised. About mothers having to choose between food and medicine for their children.  About the torture of prisoners in Iraq, in Israel, in America. ("<em>Strike off the handcuffs!</em>" says Isaiah.)

Are these "politics"?  Are they God crying out to us, as the homeless, the imprisoned, the tortured, cry out to God?

I urge and invite us to begin NOW to imagine how to let God's leopard loose on Yom Kippur. Or at any other time, to let the subversiveness of prayer leap from the letters in the prayerbook.
