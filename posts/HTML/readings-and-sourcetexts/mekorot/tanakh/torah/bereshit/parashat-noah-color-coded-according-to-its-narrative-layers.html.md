According to the poetry of the Midrash Tanchuma, Bereshit 1:1, the words of the Torah were inscribed "black fire on white fire." For many years, I've wanted to look deeply into the black fire and visualize the full spectrum of the Torah's sources, hidden within the black fire but revealed through  a critical analysis of its layers of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redaction_criticism">redaction</a>. Below, I've set the text of the first Torah portion in the annual Torah reading cycle, using color-coding to distinguish the stratigraphic layers forming the composition of the Masoretic text according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplementary_hypothesis">Supplementary Hypothesis</a> presented by Tsemaḥ Yoreh in his <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=tpLIngEACAAJ">Kernel to Canon</a> series of books (2013-2017). As Dr. Yoreh explains, 

<blockquote>The Supplementary Hypothesis asserts that the Pentateuch was composed by several different writers. This reflects an overwhelming academic consensus on Biblical authorship, even among scholars who do not subscribe to the Supplementary Hypothesis in particular.[....] According to the Supplementary Hypothesis, Biblical narrative is layered. No editor took a blowtorch to the parts of the Bible he disagreed with and destroyed them; if he had, we would not find these repetitions and contradictions. Instead, Biblical narrative began with a coherent, foundational bedrock, which over time accreted more and more storylines. Unlike geological processes, though, this process of addition was deliberate. What happened if one author disagreed with his predecessor’s storyline or worldview? He did not simply take an axe to the narrative; instead, he attempted to bury his predecessor’s point of view by repeating his own over and over again, thus skewing our understanding of the story in new ways. Every generation of readers sees the world differently, and thus every generation of writers seeks to adapt their predecessors’ cultural heritage to their own situation. We are not meant simply to dismiss earlier stories; rather, the intention of later writers is to transform our understanding of those stories via their additions.</blockquote>

<span class="j">&#11035; The earliest of the three strata in Parashat Noaḥ was composed in the late eighth or early seventh century BCE in the southern Kingdom of Judah. This layer is indicated with a BLUE text, and is commonly known as the "J."</span> (The oldest layer in the Torah, "E," does not appear in Parashat Noaḥ.) 

<span class="p">&#11035; Text in GREEN indicates the "P" (i.e. Priestly) layer, and is, as Dr. Yoreh explains, "responsible for supplementing the 'J' narrative with dates, names, and numbers, thus 'ordering' and authenticating J's account." This strata dates from the exilic period, 571–486 BCE.</span>

<span class="b">&#11035; Presented here in FUCHSIA is the final redactor of the text, a post-exilic (pre-3rd c. BCE) source that Dr. Yoreh refers to as the "Bridger." B supplements earlier strata with genealogies and popular myths, providing narrative bridges between distant story cycles.</span>

Parashat Noaḥ (Genesis 6:9-11:32) in the annual Torah reading cycle, is read on the first shabbat of the month of Marḥeshvan (a/k/a Bul), which due to the onset of the rainy season, is most closely associated with floods. The parashah is preceded by <a href="https://opensiddur.org/liturgical-readings/torah-readings/annual-cycle/sefer-bereshit/parashat-bereshit/parashat-bereishit-genesis/">Parashat Bereshit</a> (Genesis 1:1-6:8); <a href="https://opensiddur.org/liturgical-readings/torah-readings/annual-cycle/sefer-bereshit/parashat-lekh-lekha/parashat-lekh-lekha-color-coded-according-to-its-narrative-layers/">parashat Lekh Lekha</a> (Genesis 12:1-17:27) follows it.

For J it is וימח – "he blotted out" in vs. 23, and earlier on in 6:7. For P, the description of life's termination is typically less anthropomormphic and the words used are גוע, מות, relating to the death of the animals, rather than to any direct action on God's part. The exact details of how high the waters rose are typical of the quantitative minutiae P likes to add to the text.[/foot] <span class="j"><sup>23</sup>&nbsp;He blotted out all existing-things that were on the face of the fertile-ground, from man to herd-animal, to crawling thing and to birds of the heavens, they were blotted out from the earth.

On the 17th day of the 2nd month, the flood begins with rain and underground water for 40 days. 2. The flood lasts for 150 days until the 17th day of the 7th month  – the peak of the flood being 15 cubits above mountain level. 3. On the 17th day of the 7th month the ark rests upon mount Ararat; 4. The water continues to ebb until the tops of the mountains are visible on the 1st day of the 10th month. 5. On the 1st day of the 1st month of the following year the ground is visible and drying. 6. On the 17th day of the 2nd month, exactly a year after the flood began the land was dry and Noah's family leaves the ark. ¶ In J the flood lasts for 40 days, then Noah tests to see if there is dry land with two different birds, and when he finds out that there is indeed dry land he leaves the ark. ¶ J tells Noah's story (and thus is sparse regarding dates), whereas P chronicles events (and thus is heavy in quantitative details).

The events in J in 8:6-12 span 54 days, bringing us to the end of the 11th month (according to P's count), and thus well before the next date in P - the 1st day of the 1st month of the following year.[/foot]

Note the prohibition against spilling blood in vss. 5-6, echoed in the Priestly laws of sacrifice in Leviticus 17 and elsewhere. According to P and H, blood is the essence or the soul of living things and therefore should be treated reverently. Vs. 7 echoes the Priestly command to multiply in Chapter 1:22, 28. [/foot]

I posit that only the final verse (vs. 32): (These are the families of Noah’s sons, according to their genealogies, in their nations; and from these the nations spread abroad on the earth after the flood), which provides a fitting conclusion to the whole list, is original to the P genealogy. Such summarizing verses are appropriate to B's supplemented genealogy, which is much longer (except in the case of Yephet). Note also that only B really goes into a list of these nations lands (e.g. vs. 30), whereas P provides just a barebones list, the summarizing verses thus make more sense as B additions.[/foot]

This is contrary to J who has Abraham leaving the anonymous land of his birth after being commanded to do so by the Lord (Chapter 12). P wishes to further distinguish the Semite line from whence Abraham originated (and thus adds this genealogy), as opposed to J who begins Israelite history with Abraham.[/foot]

<hr />

The Masoretic text presented here is from Rabbi Dr. Seth (Avi) Kadish's <a href="https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/פרשת_נח/טעמים">Miqra al pi ha-Mesorah</a>. For the translation in English, I have adapted the translation of Everett Fox in the <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/series/DA5/the-schocken-bible">Schocken Bible</a> (1997), mostly to re-Hebraize divine names, but I have made other changes. In place of Fox's "humanity" and "the human" for the translation for "ha-Adam," I have chosen "the Earthling." In place of "begetting," I have chosen "fathering" or "progeny." In place of "slaughter-site," I have offered "place-for-slaughter." And in place of "soil" (for Adamah), I have chosen "fertile-ground" in almost every instance, as well as emphasizing the feminine gender of Adamah, which seems to me important for this mythopoetic narrative. Aside from these, I have made minor punctuation changes.
