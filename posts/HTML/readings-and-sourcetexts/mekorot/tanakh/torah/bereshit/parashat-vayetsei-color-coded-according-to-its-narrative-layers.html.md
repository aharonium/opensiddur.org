According to the poetry of the Midrash Tanchuma, Bereshit 1:1, the words of the Torah were inscribed "black fire on white fire." For many years, I've wanted to look deeply into the black fire and visualize the full spectrum of the Torah's sources, hidden within the black fire but revealed through  a critical analysis of its layers of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redaction_criticism">redaction</a>. Below, I've set the text of the first Torah portion in the annual Torah reading cycle, using color-coding to distinguish the stratigraphic layers forming the composition of the Masoretic text according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplementary_hypothesis">Supplementary Hypothesis</a> presented by Tsemaḥ Yoreh in his <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=tpLIngEACAAJ">Kernel to Canon</a> series of books (2013-2017). As Dr. Yoreh explains, 

<blockquote>The Supplementary Hypothesis asserts that the Pentateuch was composed by several different writers. This reflects an overwhelming academic consensus on Biblical authorship, even among scholars who do not subscribe to the Supplementary Hypothesis in particular.[....] According to the Supplementary Hypothesis, Biblical narrative is layered. No editor took a blowtorch to the parts of the Bible he disagreed with and destroyed them; if he had, we would not find these repetitions and contradictions. Instead, Biblical narrative began with a coherent, foundational bedrock, which over time accreted more and more storylines. Unlike geological processes, though, this process of addition was deliberate. What happened if one author disagreed with his predecessor’s storyline or worldview? He did not simply take an axe to the narrative; instead, he attempted to bury his predecessor’s point of view by repeating his own over and over again, thus skewing our understanding of the story in new ways. Every generation of readers sees the world differently, and thus every generation of writers seeks to adapt their predecessors’ cultural heritage to their own situation. We are not meant simply to dismiss earlier stories; rather, the intention of later writers is to transform our understanding of those stories via their additions.</blockquote>

<span class="e">&#11035; The kernel of biblical text upon which all other narratives were laid is thought to have been composed in the mid- to late eighth century BCE toward the end of the heyday of the northern Kingdom of Ephraim (one of the two kingdoms that occupied Biblical Israel). This layer, commonly referred to as 'E', is indicated with INDIGO text. The last parashah containing text of this layer was <a href="https://opensiddur.org/liturgical-readings/torah-readings/annual-cycle/sefer-bereshit/parashat-vayera/parashat-vayera-color-coded-according-to-its-narrative-layers/">parashat Vayera</a>.</span>

<span class="j">&#11035; The next oldest layer is thought to have been composed in the late eighth or early seventh century BCE in the southern Kingdom of Judah. This layer, commonly known as 'J', is indicated with a BLUE text.</span> 

<span class="p">&#11035; The next strata, thought to have been composed during the exilic to early post-exilic period (571–486 BCE) is, as Dr. Yoreh explains, "responsible for supplementing the 'J' narrative with dates, names, and numbers, thus 'ordering' and authenticating 'J's account." This layer, commonly referred to as 'P' (for 'Priestly') appears here in GREEN text.</span>

Parashat Vayetsei (Genesis 28:10-32:3) in the annual Torah reading cycle, is read on the first shabbat of the month of Kislev. The parashah is preceded by <a href="https://opensiddur.org/readings-and-sourcetexts/torah-readings/annual-cycle/sefer-bereshit/parashat-toldot/parashat-toldot-color-coded-according-to-its-narrative-layers/">Toldōt</a> (Genesis 25:19-28:9); parashat <a href="https://opensiddur.org/readings-and-sourcetexts/torah-readings/annual-cycle/sefer-bereshit/parashat-vayishlah/parashat-vayishlah-color-coded-according-to-its-narrative-layers/">Vayishlaḥ</a> (Genesis 32:4-36:43) follows it.

Abraham was the theological model, and Jacob was the progenitor of the Israelite nation.[/foot] <span class="j">and went toward Ḥarran,</span>[foot]Ḥaran is Jacob's destination according to J, as we will soon see in the Yahwistic supplement to Chapter 29.

He had to spend the night there, for the sun had come in. Now he took one of the stones of the place and set it at his head and lay down in that place. <sup>12</sup>&nbsp;And he dreamt: Here, a ladder was set up on the earth, its top reaching the heavens, and here: messengers of Elohim were going up and down on it.</span>[foot]The Elohistic revelation is non-verbal, thus Jacob's vow of vs. 20-22 (E) is not cognizant of the similarly worded divine promise in vss. 13-15 (J).[/foot] <span class="j"> <sup>13</sup>&nbsp;And here: YHVH was standing over against him. He said: "I am YHVH, the <em>elo'ah</em> of Avraham your father and the <em>elo'ah</em> of Yitsḥaq. The land on which you lie I give to you and to your seed. <sup>14</sup>&nbsp;Your seed will be like the dust of the earth; you will burst forth, to the Sea, to the east, to the north, to the Negev. All the clans of the fertile-ground will find blessing through you and through your seed! <sup>15</sup>&nbsp;Here, I am with you, I will watch over you wherever you go and will bring you back to this soil; indeed, I will not leave you until I have done what I have spoken to you." <sup>16</sup>&nbsp;Yaaqov awoke from his sleep and said: "Why, YHVH is in this place, and I, I did not know it!"</span>[foot]Note the switch from "God" (Elohim) to "the Lord" (Yhwh). The promise of progeny is common to J, and non-existent in E. The Lord's promise to Jacob is a later restatement and elaboration of Jacob's vow (vs. 20-22). In vss. 20-22 Jacob is clearly not cognizant of the similarly worded divine promise.[/foot] <span class="e"><sup>17</sup>&nbsp;He was awestruck and said: "How awe-inspiring is this place! This is none other than a house of Elohim, and that is the gate of heaven!"</span>

<span class="e"><sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Yaaqov started – early in the morning, he took the stone that he had set at his head and set it up as a standing-pillar and poured oil on top of it.</span>[foot]In E, God is actually present in the rock in some way, and thus Jacob sets it up as a pillar. In J the Lord simply reveals himself there.[/foot] <span class="j"><sup>19</sup>&nbsp;And he called the name of the place: 'Bet-El/House of El' – however, Luz was the name of the city in former times.</span>[foot]J provides an alternate name for the site of the revelation in order to lessen the effect of the notion that God is specially tied to the place (Bethel = the house of God in biblical Hebrew).[/foot] <span class="e"><sup>20</sup>&nbsp;And Yaaqov vowed a vow, saying: "If Elohim will be with me and will watch over me on this way that I go and will give me food to eat and a garment to wear, <sup>21</sup>&nbsp;and if I come back in peace to my father's house</span>[foot]See comment on 29:12.[/foot] <span class="j">– YHVH shall be Elohim to me,</span>[foot]This equation between the Lord and God (Yhwh and Elohim) is common throughout J, and compare the usage in Genesis 2-3 (J). A further theological statement is being made here, namely that the Lord is the God that was revealed here and not a local deity connected with the site.[/foot] <span class="e"><sup>22</sup>&nbsp;and this stone that I have set up as a standing-pillar shall become a house of Elohim, and everything that you give me I shall tithe, tithe it to you."</span>[foot]The establishment of Bethel as a shrine goes against J notion of centralization of cult, thus the attempts above to desanctify it (the change of name, revelation as opposed to being tied to the site). Bethel is, however, one of the most important cultic sites in the Northern Kingdom and is therefore important to E which was written in the north.[/foot]

<span class="j"><sup>31</sup>&nbsp;Now when YHVH saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb, while Raḥel was barren.</span>[foot]"The Lord" is employed here as a divine name, and thus the beginning of this narrative is likely Yahwistic. Matriarchal barrenness is a Yahwistic theme and compare Sarah's barrenness (Chapter 16), and Rebecca' barrenness (Chapter 25). The word barren is not used to describe the matriarchs in E.[/foot] <span class="e"><sup>32</sup>&nbsp;So Leah became pregnant and bore a son; she called his name: 'Re'uven/See, a Son!' for she said:</span>[foot]According to E, Jacob had only seven sons. The two most significant tribes missing from the Elohistic account are Levi and Judah, who are unimportant to an author writing in the Northern Kingdom (compare the song of Deborah in Judges 5 where these tribes are also absent). When the J who was a southern Judean author inherited the Elohistic narrative he added 5 tribes who were important to his audience. ¶ Further proof for 7 as the original number of tribes exists in Chapters 43:34 and 45:22 where Joseph gives Benjamin five times the gifts he gives the rest of his brothers. If there are 12 brothers, this number has no significance. If there are seven brothers, however, Joseph gives Benjamin the same amount of gifts as all the rest of the brothers combined, accentuating the literary theme that Benjamin is worth the same as all the rest of Joseph's brothers, since without him the brothers would not receive food.[/foot] <span class="j">"Indeed, YHVH has seen my being afflicted,</span>[foot]There are two name etymologies (explanations) in this verse: 1. Because the Lord looked on my affliction; 2. Surely now my husband will love me. Each of the etymologies feature most of the letters of the name, although the second explanation lacks the first letter. The phenomenon of double etymologies for Jacob's children is also apparent in the birth notices of Zebulun, Joseph, and perhaps Issachar. In each of the cases the first etymology is further from the name than the second etymology. In two of the cases (Reuben and Joseph), the "better" etymology employs "the Lord" as a divine name. It thus seems that the original narrative was supplemented by a later Yahwistic editor, who added (among other things) superior name etymologies.[/foot] <span class="e">indeed, now my husband will love me!"</span>[foot]See previous comment.[/foot] <span class="j"><sup>33</sup>&nbsp;She became pregnant again and bore a son, and said: "Indeed, YHVH has heard that I am hated, so he has given me this one as well!"

It is, however, arguable whether Jacob's act was rash. The relationship between Laban and Jacob had soured and leaving was a natural act. The only rash act recorded in the text is the theft of Laban's idols by Rachel referred to in vs. 29. The intervening section mentions the God of Jacob's father and the house of Jacob's father; as mentioned above though Jacob's father is not a character in the Elohistic version of events.

The solution we offer here is startling in its simplicity. One must simply read these verses together with vss. 24-30, Jacob saw a company of angels and one fought with one of them. Both texts are clearly Elohistic (contra the majority view) since “God” is the only name that appears in both sections. Moreover, Jacob is described here as strong and virile as in the Elohistic version of Chapter 29. In J texts Jacob is described as weak and cowardly as in vss. 3-23 of this chapter. The change of name from Jacob to Israel coincides nicely with the usage of the latter name in the Joseph cycle by E as opposed to the retention of the original Jacob by J.[/foot]

The Masoretic text presented here is from Rabbi Dr. Seth (Avi) Kadish's <a href="https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/פרשת_ויצא/טעמים">Miqra al pi ha-Mesorah</a>. For the translation in English, I have adapted the translation of Everett Fox in the <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/series/DA5/the-schocken-bible">Schocken Bible</a> (1997), mostly to re-Hebraize divine names, place names, and personal names, but I have made other changes. In place of "soil" for "adamah," I have "fertile-ground." And in verse 29:10, I have added back an instance of <span class="hebrew" lang="he">אחי אמו</span> ("his mother's brother") that was omitted by Fox, probably for what he may have considered redundancy. Aside from these, I have made minor punctuation changes.
