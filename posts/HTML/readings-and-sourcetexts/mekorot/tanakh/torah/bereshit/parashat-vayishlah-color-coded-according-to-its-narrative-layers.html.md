According to the poetry of the Midrash Tanchuma, Bereshit 1:1, the words of the Torah were inscribed "black fire on white fire." For many years, I've wanted to look deeply into the black fire and visualize the full spectrum of the Torah's sources, hidden within the black fire but revealed through  a critical analysis of its layers of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redaction_criticism">redaction</a>. Below, I've set the text of the eighth Torah portion in the annual Torah reading cycle, using color-coding to distinguish the stratigraphic layers forming the composition of the Masoretic text according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplementary_hypothesis">Supplementary Hypothesis</a> presented by Tsemaḥ Yoreh in his <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=tpLIngEACAAJ">Kernel to Canon</a> series of books (2013-2017). As Dr. Yoreh explains, 

<blockquote>The Supplementary Hypothesis asserts that the Pentateuch was composed by several different writers. This reflects an overwhelming academic consensus on Biblical authorship, even among scholars who do not subscribe to the Supplementary Hypothesis in particular.[....] According to the Supplementary Hypothesis, Biblical narrative is layered. No editor took a blowtorch to the parts of the Bible he disagreed with and destroyed them; if he had, we would not find these repetitions and contradictions. Instead, Biblical narrative began with a coherent, foundational bedrock, which over time accreted more and more storylines. Unlike geological processes, though, this process of addition was deliberate. What happened if one author disagreed with his predecessor’s storyline or worldview? He did not simply take an axe to the narrative; instead, he attempted to bury his predecessor’s point of view by repeating his own over and over again, thus skewing our understanding of the story in new ways. Every generation of readers sees the world differently, and thus every generation of writers seeks to adapt their predecessors’ cultural heritage to their own situation. We are not meant simply to dismiss earlier stories; rather, the intention of later writers is to transform our understanding of those stories via their additions.</blockquote>

<span class="e">&#11035; The kernel of biblical text upon which all other narratives were laid is thought to have been composed in the mid- to late eighth century BCE toward the end of the heyday of the northern Kingdom of Ephraim (one of the two kingdoms that occupied Biblical Israel). This layer, commonly referred to as 'E', is indicated with INDIGO text. The first parashah containing text of this layer is <a href="https://opensiddur.org/liturgical-readings/torah-readings/annual-cycle/sefer-bereshit/parashat-vayera/parashat-vayera-color-coded-according-to-its-narrative-layers/">parashat Vayera</a>.</span>

<span class="j">&#11035; The next oldest layer is thought to have been composed in the late eighth or early seventh century BCE in the southern Kingdom of Judah. This layer, commonly known as 'J', is indicated with a BLUE text.</span> 

<span class="p">&#11035; The next strata, thought to have been composed during the exilic to early post-exilic period (571–486 BCE) is, as Dr. Yoreh explains, "responsible for supplementing the 'J' narrative with dates, names, and numbers, thus 'ordering' and authenticating 'J's account." This layer, commonly referred to as 'P' (for 'Priestly') appears here in GREEN text.</span>

<span class="b">&#11035; The most recent layer of text, is a post-exilic (pre-3rd century BCE) text that Dr. Yoreh refers to as the "Bridger" which supplements earlier strata with genealogies and popular myths, providing narrative bridges between distant story cycles. This 'B' layer is presented here in FUCHSIA.</span>

Parashat Vayishlaḥ (Genesis 32:4-36:43) in the annual Torah reading cycle, is read on the second shabbat of the month of Kislev. The parashah is preceded by <a href="https://opensiddur.org/readings-and-sourcetexts/torah-readings/annual-cycle/sefer-bereshit/parashat-vayetsei/parashat-vayetsei-color-coded-according-to-its-narrative-layers/">Vayetsei</a> (Genesis 28:10-32:3); parashat <a href="https://opensiddur.org/readings-and-sourcetexts/torah-readings/annual-cycle/sefer-bereshit/parashat-vayeshev/parashat-vayeshev-color-coded-according-to-its-narrative-layers/">Vayeshev</a> (Genesis 37:1–40:23) follows it.

<span class="j">32 <sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Now Yaaqov sent messengers on ahead of him to Esav his brother in the land of Se'ir, in the territory of Edom, <sup>5</sup>&nbsp;and commanded them, saying: "Thus say to my lord, to Esav: 'Thus says your servant Yaaqov: I have sojourned with Lavan and have tarried until now. <sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Ox and donkey, sheep and servant and maid have become mine. I have sent to tell my lord, to find favor in your eyes.'" <sup>7</sup>&nbsp;The messengers returned to Yaaqov, saying: "We came to your brother, to Esav – but he is already coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him!" <sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Yaaqov became exceedingly afraid and was distressed. He divided the people that were with him and the sheep and the oxen and the camels into two camps, <sup>9</sup>&nbsp;saying to himself: "Should Esav come against the one camp and strike it, the camp that is left will escape." <sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Then Yaaqov said: "Elo'ah of my father Avraham, <em>elo'ah</em> of my father Yitsḥaq, YHVH, who said to me: 'Return to your land, to your kindred, and I will deal well with you!' <sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Too small am I for all the faithfulness and trust that you have shown your servant. For with only my rod did I cross this Yarden, and now I have become two camps. <sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Pray save me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esav! For I am in fear of him, lest he come and strike me down, mothers and children alike! <sup>13</sup>&nbsp;But you, you have said: 'I will deal well, well with you, I will make your seed like the sand of the sea, which is too much to count!'"

P thus attempts to justify the massacre as saving the Israelites from an assimilationist pact (assimilation is one of the reason the Israelites are commanded to annihilate the inhabitants of Canaan, and compare Exodus 34:11-16). ¶ I also think that naming Shechem as a Hivvite is a P addition attempting to justify the massacre, since the Hivvites are one of the 6-7 nations that are to be annihilated according to virtually all the post-Elohistic sources (e.g., Exodus 23:23).[/foot] <span class="j">the prince of the land, saw her:</span>[foot]In the J version of events Shechem only saw Dinah, he did not rape her.

The reason for choosing Simeon and Levi specifically is that they are two of the older children in line for the birthright of the eldest, their shame here together with Reuben's shame after sleeping with his father’s handmaiden (35:22), paves the way for Judah, the fourth son, to inherit the birthright.[/foot] <span class="p">Shim'on and Levi, Dinah's full-brothers,</span>[foot]See the above comment.[/foot] <span class="j">took each man his sword, they came upon the city (feeling) secure, and killed all the males,</span>[foot]J’s version of events where all of Jacob’s family participated in the massacre makes more narratival sense, simply because it would be hard for two people to kill all the inhabitants of a city.[/foot] <span class="p"><sup>26</sup>&nbsp;and Ḥamor and Shekhem his son they killed by the sword.

<span class="p">36 <sup>1</sup>&nbsp;And these are the progeny of Esav – that is Edom.</span>[foot]A typical Priestly introduction to genealogical lists, found for example, in Genesis 2:4, 5:1, 25:19, 37:1, etc. Following the narrative conclusion of the Jacob cycle P appends information regarding Esau, and compare the addendum to the Abraham cycle in Genesis 25:12, which lists Ishmael’s sons.[/foot] <span class="b"><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Esav took his wives from the women of K'naan: Adah, daughter of Elon the Ḥitti, and Oholivamah, daughter of Anah (and) granddaughter of Tsiv'on the Ḥivvi, <sup>3</sup>&nbsp;and Ba'semat, daughter of Yishmael and sister of Nevayot. <sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Adah bore Elifaz to Esav, Ba'semat bore Re'uel, <sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Oholivamah bore Ye'ush, Ya'lam, and Qoraḥ. These are Esav's sons, who were born to him in the land of K'naan. <sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Esav took his wives, his sons and his daughters, and all the persons in his household, as well as his acquired-livestock, all his animals, and all his acquisitions that he had gained in the land of K'naan, and went to (another) land, away from Yaaqov his brother; <sup>7</sup>&nbsp;for their property was too much for them to settle together, the land of their sojourning could not support them, on account of their acquired-livestock. <sup>8</sup>&nbsp;So Esav settled in the hill-country of Se'ir-Esav, that is Edom. <sup>9</sup>&nbsp;And these are the progeny of Esav, the tribal-father of Edom, in the hill-country of Se'ir:</span>[foot]Note the resumptive repetition in 36:9  (“This is the History of Generations of Esau”), which echoes 36:1, this indicates the insertion of later material. The question here, is since the lists are essentially the same why would a later source just add a doublet? The answer is elaboration. The first  and later list elaborates the second list. ¶ B, the supplementer here,  arbitrates between two traditions: On the one hand there are the H additions to Chapters 26-28, which indicate that Esau took two Canaanite wives, Judith the Daughter of Beeri, Basemat the Daughter of Elon – both of whom are Hittite, and that following his parents displeasure he took a third wife, Yishmael’s daughter, Machalat, thereby echoing his brother, who also marries his first cousins. On the other hand there is P’s tradition which also speaks of Basemat, but has Esau marrying the hitherto unknown Adah (their nationality is not recorded in P). B enters into the fray, accepting H’s essential contention that Esau married women of the Land (Hittite and Hivvite), and that Esau married his cousin, but relying upon the Priestly names – Adah and Basemat (Perhaps he dismisses Judith as too Judean of a name). In B, Basemat, and not Machalat is Ishmael’s daughter. ¶ B, however, adds his own international flavor to this genealogy, adding Oholibama the daughter of Anna the Daughter of Tzivon the Horrite (the Hebrew text and its English translation are in error here and should be emended to Horrite rather than Hivvite). B, tells us of Esau’s intermarriage with the Horrites who lived in Seir, and adds a short historical excerpt about them in vss. 20-30. B also mention the Horrites in Genesis 14:6 and in  Deut 2:12, as part of his internationalization of the biblical text. Two further concretize the connection between Esau and the Horrites. Esau’s eldest son Elifaz, marries Timna, the daughter of Lotan the Horrite (vs. 22) according to B (and see vs. 12.). ¶ Note also the use of the Qal Passive Yuldu in vs. 5, which often marks B’s genealogies.[/foot] <span class="p"><sup>10</sup>&nbsp;These are the names of the sons of Esav: Elifaz son of Adah, Esav's wife, Re'uel, son of Ba'semat, Esav's wife. <sup>11</sup>&nbsp;The sons of Elifaz were Teman, Omar, Ts'fo, Ga'tam, and Q'naz.</span>[foot]This short list includes Esau’s two wives, who each had one child, and then who in turn had children of their own.[/foot] <span class="b"><sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Now Timna was concubine to Elifaz son of Esav, and she bore Amaleq to Elifaz.</span>[foot]See comment on 36:9, Elifaz’s marriage to Timna concretizes Esau’s connection to the Horrites of Seir. Moreover, B, neatly connects Amalek and Esau, (Elifaz father’s Amalek through Timna), thus genetically tying between two of Israel’s ancient enemies.[/foot] <span class="p">These are the sons of Adah, Esav's wife. <sup>13</sup>&nbsp;And these are the sons of Re'uel: Naḥat and Zeraḥ, Shammah and Mizzah. These were the sons of Ba'semat, Esav's wife.</span>[foot]See penultimate comment.[/foot] <span class="b"><sup>14</sup>&nbsp;And these were the sons of Oholivamah, daughter of Anah, (and) granddaughter of Tsiv'on (and) Esav's wife: She bore Ye'ush and Ya'lam and Qoraḥ to Esav.</span>

The Masoretic text presented here is from Rabbi Dr. Seth (Avi) Kadish's <a href="https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/פרשת_וישלח/טעמים">Miqra al pi ha-Mesorah</a>. For the translation in English, I have adapted the translation of Everett Fox in the <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/series/DA5/the-schocken-bible">Schocken Bible</a> (1997), mostly to re-Hebraize divine names, place names, and personal names, but I have made other changes. In place of "slaughter-site," I have offered "place-for-slaughter" and in place of "begettings" I have "progeny." Aside from these, I have made minor punctuation changes.
