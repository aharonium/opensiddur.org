According to the poetry of the Midrash Tanchuma, Bereshit 1:1, the words of the Torah were inscribed "black fire on white fire." For many years, I've wanted to look deeply into the black fire and visualize the full spectrum of the Torah's sources, hidden within the black fire but revealed through  a critical analysis of its layers of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redaction_criticism">redaction</a>. Below, I've set the text of the first Torah portion in the annual Torah reading cycle, using color-coding to distinguish the stratigraphic layers forming the composition of the Masoretic text according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplementary_hypothesis">Supplementary Hypothesis</a> presented by Tsemaḥ Yoreh in his <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=tpLIngEACAAJ">Kernel to Canon</a> series of books (2013-2017). As Dr. Yoreh explains, 

<blockquote>The Supplementary Hypothesis asserts that the Pentateuch was composed by several different writers. This reflects an overwhelming academic consensus on Biblical authorship, even among scholars who do not subscribe to the Supplementary Hypothesis in particular.[....] According to the Supplementary Hypothesis, Biblical narrative is layered. No editor took a blowtorch to the parts of the Bible he disagreed with and destroyed them; if he had, we would not find these repetitions and contradictions. Instead, Biblical narrative began with a coherent, foundational bedrock, which over time accreted more and more storylines. Unlike geological processes, though, this process of addition was deliberate. What happened if one author disagreed with his predecessor’s storyline or worldview? He did not simply take an axe to the narrative; instead, he attempted to bury his predecessor’s point of view by repeating his own over and over again, thus skewing our understanding of the story in new ways. Every generation of readers sees the world differently, and thus every generation of writers seeks to adapt their predecessors’ cultural heritage to their own situation. We are not meant simply to dismiss earlier stories; rather, the intention of later writers is to transform our understanding of those stories via their additions.</blockquote>

<span class="j">&#11035; The earliest of the three strata in Parashat Bereshit was composed in the late eighth or early seventh century BCE in the southern Kingdom of Judah. This layer is indicated with a BLUE text, and is commonly known as the "J."</span> (The oldest layer in the Torah, "E," does not appear in Parashat Bereshit.) 

<span class="p">&#11035; Text in GREEN indicates the "P" (i.e. Priestly) layer, and is, as Dr. Yoreh explains, "responsible for supplementing the 'J' narrative with dates, names, and numbers, thus 'ordering' and authenticating J's account." This strata dates from the exilic period, 571–486 BCE.</span>

<span class="b">&#11035; Presented here in FUCHSIA is the final redactor of the text, a post-exilic (pre-3rd c. BCE) source that Dr. Yoreh refers to as the "Bridger." B supplements earlier strata with genealogies and popular myths, providing narrative bridges between distant story cycles.</span>

Parashat Bereshit (Genesis 1:1-6:8) in the annual Torah reading cycle is read on the Shabbat following the festival of Sukkot and Shemini Atseret (Simḥat Torah), the last shabbat in the month of Tishrei. The parashah is followed by <a href="https://opensiddur.org/liturgical-readings/torah-readings/annual-cycle/sefer-bereshit/parashat-noah/parashat-noah-color-coded-according-to-its-narrative-layers/">Parashat Noaḥ</a> (Genesis 6:9-11:32)

<span class="p">1 <sup>1</sup>&nbsp;At the beginning of Elohim's[foot]Elohim [=God] is used by this source almost exclusively until Exodus 6:2. Note also the use of the root ב.ר.א (Gen 1:1, 21) as opposed to י.צ.ר in the subsequent chapter (Gen 2:7, 8) - attributed to J; both mean "to create". The root י.צ.ר, however is usually associated with material creation (commonly clay), whereas ב.ר.א is further removed. This distinction is indicative of the foci of Chapters 1 and 2. In Chapter 1 the deity is removed, whereas in Chapter 2 the deity is more present. The use of multiple verbs to emphasize fruitfulness appears in God's blessing to human beings and animals (vss. 22, 28) both here and after the flood (9:1); the same words (and others) are used to describe the Israelites' fruitfulness in Exodus 1:7. [/foot] creating of the heavens and the earth, <sup>2</sup>&nbsp;when the earth was Tōhu/chaos and Bōhu/inchoate, Ḥoshekh/darkness over the face of Tehōm/Abyss, rushing-spirit of Elohim hovering over the face of the waters – <sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Elohim said: "Let there be light!" And there was light. <sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Elohim saw the light: that it was good. Elohim separated the light from the darkness. <sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Elohim called the light: 'Day' and the darkness he called: 'Night.' There was setting, there was dawning: one day.</span>[foot]God creates light and not darkness (vs. 3), often taken to mean that God creates good and not evil. This dualistic theology is seen in other places in the P source, most prominently in Leviticus 15 where Yhwh (the Lord) and Azazel (a demon) are accorded some measure of equality.[/foot]

The question of relationship between J and P is oft discussed in scholarship, one school claiming that P is supplementary to J (i.e. was dependent upon J composing or sculpting his narratives as additions to the J narrative), the second school claiming that P was composed independently and was combined with J by a later redactor. The position adopted in this commentary will be the former; I think that the process of narrative composition in the Pentateuch and former prophets was almost exclusively supplementary. For a popular documentary commentary on the Pentateuch (the latter position) see Friedman's color coded Bible. My book-series Kernel to Canon and this website present the documentary hypothesis for comparative purposes, but without commentary.[/foot]

<span class="p"><sup>4</sup>&nbsp;These are the progeny of the Heavens and the Earth: their being created.</span>[foot]There are two ways in which the אלה תולדות (= "these are the generations") formula can be viewed; as a closing statement summarizing the seven days of creation or as an opening statement introducing the narrative beginning in 2:4b. Taking into account the other ten occurrences of this formula in which it always functions as an introduction, it seems a lot likelier that אלה תולדות is an opening statement. The formula occurs exclusively in P texts, and thus if it is to be attributed to P here it would seem to indicate that P knew of J's narrative in Chapter 2. The other option is that of a third author combining the two narratives (Chapters 1 and 2), but that seems a lot less likely considering the prevalence of the formula in Priestly texts. Note also the appearance of the root ברא following this formula, which appears in P's Chapter 1 as opposed to the roots יצר and עשה which appear in Chapter 2. ¶The grammatical structure of vs. 4b ביום עשות ה' אלהים ארץ ושמים "("In the day that the Lord God made earth and Heavens") is parallel to the grammatical structure of Gen 1:1, בראשית ברא אלהים את השמים ואת הארץ (often mistranslated as "in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth", no the is apparent in the vocalized Hebrew) – both are  temporal clauses dependent upon the subsequent verses, thus both may be paraphrased as "When God created heaven and earth, the earth was…."[/foot] <span class="j">At the time of YHVH Elohim's making[foot]The distinction between ברא (to create ) in Chapter 1 and יצר (to create) in Chapter 2 was noted in Chapter 1. Another creationary verb used in this chapter is עשה (eg. vs. 4b), literally to make. Note also the use of Yhwh Elohim (= Lord God), which is most often seen as a theological statement, i.e. Yhwh, the private Israelite God equals Elohim the universal God. The root to know (ידע) also plays an important role in this chapter (vs. 9) and in Chapters 3 and 4, it means to know sexually, as well as to distinguish; sexual knowledge using the verb ידע is common in J. The אלה תולות  (These are the generations) formula appears in vs. 4a. The formula is universally attributed to P, it appears some 10 other times in Genesis as an opening statement preceding genealogies or genealogical statements (e.g. Gen 5:1).[/foot] of Earth and Heaven, <sup>5</sup>&nbsp;no bush of the field was yet on earth, no plant of the field had yet sprung up, for YHVH Elohim had not made it rain upon earth, and there was no Earthling/Adam[foot]The word אדם (man, human) is the name given to the first man both in Chapters 1 and 2. In my opinion this is indicative of some relationship of dependence between them. Note the order of creation: in Chapter 2, man is the first creation, whereas in Chapter 1 man is the final creation, both are positions of importance.[/foot] to till the fertile-ground/Adamah – <sup>6</sup>&nbsp;but a surge would well up from the earth and water all the face of the fertile-ground; <sup>7</sup>&nbsp;and YHVH Elohim formed the Earthling, of dust from the fertile-ground, he blew into his nostrils the breath of life and the Earthling became a living being. <sup>8</sup>&nbsp;YHVH Elohim planted a garden in Eden/Land-of-pleasure, in the east, and there he placed the Earthling whom he had formed.[foot]Note that no Garden of Eden is mentioned in P's creation account in Chapter 1; this could be a sign of the later author's discomfort with J's narrative of humanity's fall from grace. Note also that in Chapter 1 (P) the material from which God created human beings and animals is not mentioned, whereas in Chapter 2 (J) it is dust or earth. This may be an attempt to distance God from material creation of Chapter 2 (J), which is a human act.[/foot]  <sup>9</sup>&nbsp;YHVH Elohim caused to spring up from the fertile-ground every type of tree, desirable to look at and good to eat, and the Tree of Life in the midst of the garden and the Tree of the Knowing of Good and Evil.</span>[foot]I often like to refer to J's God as a typical Near-Eastern God, except that the playing field has been narrowed to one. As so brilliantly illustrated in Miles, God: A Biography: J's Yhwh is a non-omnipotent non-omniscient character who "suffers" from the full range of human emotions, the most prominent in the first part of Genesis is insecurity, as seen from the expulsion in Chapter 4 and the Tower of Babel narrative. The trees that threaten Yhwh domination are within the garden, yet as opposed to the rest of the trees there is no indication that He planted them – in other words they are beyond his power. Thus the seeds to Adam's downfall and or the overthrow of Yhwh are within arms reach.[/foot]

Vs. 26 explains the switch from Elohim to Yhwh as one of human initiative. This theological program is likely a secondary explanation of the switch that indeed occurs after Chapter 3 in the text. The familiarity of this source with both the narrative of Chapter 4 (the death of Abel) and the genealogical list of Chapter 5 (the birth of Seth), may also indicate a later date of composition. In this commentary it is attributed to B, the bridging source.[/foot] [foot]In Genesis 4, part of the Yahwistic composition, Cain kills his brother Abel in cold blood. The reader expects some sort of retribution, and prima facie, it seems that Cain is indeed punished: Yhwh pronounces that "the earth will not give you of her strength" (4:11) and that Cain shall be forced to wander in order to scratch out his sustenance. If the punishment is examined more closely however, one finds that it is in fact only an echo of the harshly worded curse God pronounces upon Adam. The mild language used in the description of Cain's sentence is in marked contrast with the graphic description of Cain culpability: "The blood of your brother screams to me from the earth." (4:10) Furthermore, it would seem that Cain's punishment of exile is never really carried out, he is described as "settling" in the land of Nod (4:16) – an obvious wordplay on the content of the punishment (na' vanad) thus making subtle mockery of it - and he builds the first city (4:17), both marked signs of sedentary lifestyle. Even if Cain was exiled it is clear that in the Pentateuchal law codes the punishment does not fit the crime. Exile is enumerated as a possible punishment for murder in the Pentateuchal law codes, but only in cases when the murder is accidental. ¶This, however, is not the most mystifying element of the account.  Yhwh's promise to protect Cain from retribution, by providing him with the proverbial: "Cain's mark", which would ensure a sevenfold revenge, borders on the extraordinary. The fact that people would wish to kill Cain is only natural and entirely just according to the law codes of the time, Cain did kill his brother in cold blood after all. No protection is provided to a person who kills his or her fellow in cold blood according to Deuteronomy. In fact, it is the closest living relative's responsibility to kill the murderer. Lemech, Cain's descendant, brags that if Cain were to be revenged sevenfold for his death, than he, Lemech, who also is guilty of murder should be revenged seventy seven fold in case of his (Lemech’s) untimely demise. Lemech's pronouncement can be understood as a mockery of Yhwh's promise to Cain to keep from harm. How can a murderer expect retribution in the case of his death? His death, according to all conventional legal systems is entirely justified. Abel's blood then continues to scream across the generations, and who shall answer it? Who shall punish the first murderer? ¶The answer that J provides is the flood. Cain's fratricide marks the antedelluvian (pre-flood) generation as evil and sets the stage for the cataclysmic flood which follows immediately. The answer P provides is evident in Chapter 5, and see the commentary there.[/foot] <span class="b"><sup>25</sup>&nbsp;Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son. She called his name: Shet/Granted-one! meaning: Elohim has granted me another seed in place of Hevel, for Qayin killed him. <sup>26</sup>&nbsp;To Shet as well a son was born, he called his name: Enosh/Mortal. At that time they first called out the name of YHVH.</span>[foot]Note the use of the qal passive form yulad (was born) in vs. 26, which appears in the post priestly (Bridger) genealogies of Chapter 10, as well as in Gen 22:20-22, and in many other places, P uses the hiphil (vayoled – he fathered, as throughout Genesis 11, or the niphal (hivaled – was born) form, as in Genesis 21:5, of the verb ילד (to give birth).[/foot]

<span class="p"><sup>28</sup>&nbsp;When</span>[foot]As noted in the general comments (see comment below v.31) the birth notice of Noah differs markedly from the rest of the genealogical list. The god name is different (Yhwh versus Elohim); a reason for Noah's name is provided as opposed to the rest of the genealogical list; the reason is related to God's curse of J's Chapter 3. The original birth notice is thus attributed to the J author. It was then sculpted to fit better with the P genealogical list, thus the P additions in the body of the notice.[/foot] <span class="j">Lemekh</span> <span class="p">had lived eighty-two years and a hundred years,</span> <span class="j">he fathered a son. <sup>29</sup>&nbsp;He called his name: Noaḥ! saying: Zeh yenaḥamenu/May this-one comfort-our-sorrow from our toil, from the pains of our hands coming from the fertile-ground/Adamah, which YHVH has damned.</span> <span class="p"><sup>30</sup>&nbsp;And Lemekh lived after he fathered Noaḥ ninety-five years and five hundred years, and fathered (other) sons and daughters. <sup>31</sup>&nbsp;And all the days of Lemekh were seventy-seven years and seven hundred years, then he died.</span>[foot]We never hear what happens to Cain's progeny in Chapter 4; after Lemech and his children, the lists ends, and presumably we are meant to think that they died in the flood. Seth, Adam third son (vs. 6) and the genealogy through him, was in my opinion a priestly construct inserted after the birth of Lemech children, in order to prevent the first murderer Cain from being rewarded with the honor of being humanity's founding father. ¶ J's list of Cain's sons in chapter 4 end with a Yahistic "Lemech" (4:18).  The Priestly genealogy through Seth ends with a Priestly "Lemech" giving birth to Noah (5:28-29). The etymology of Noah's name is, however, not Priestly, it is Yahwistic ("the earth, cursed by Yhwh"). Note that the rest of chapter 5 (vss. 1, 24) uses the name "Elohim" (God) whereas this verse uses the name Yhwh. It would seem then that according to the Yahwist after the birth of Lemech (the first's) other children, he finally produced a son over whom he was able to pronounce, "Here is the one who will comfort us…" (5:29). P incorporated Lemech into his genealogy (which is in fact a reworking of the J genealogy and note that P simply "borrowed" the names from J's genealogy of chapter 4: Cain vs. Keinan; Hanokh vs. Hanokh; Irad vs. Yered; Mehuyael vs Mahallel; Metushael vs. Methuselah) and thus Noah's birth notice is cut off from its original Yahwistic context and Cain from his place in biblical "history". In the J version provided on this website we place this birth notice of chapter 5 as part of the continuous J narrative.[/foot]

The addition of racy mythic elements to the book of Genesis is attributed in this commentary to the Bridging source, a post priestly redactor, who bridges between tradition cycles and adds his own mythic flavour to the narratives. 
This section is clearly removed from the rest of the chapter. Why would we talk of the lifespan of human beings when they are about to be completely destroyed? Moreover, this limited lifespan does not accord with the Noah's lifespan of 600 years in the subsequent chapter, nor with the lifespan of his children in Chapter 11. The fallen angel myth is contrary to the very monotheistic tenor of the Genesis narratives in both J and P and the decided lack of an angel hierarchy and demigod figures in these sources.[/foot]

<span class="j"><sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Now YHVH saw that great was the Earthling's evildoing on earth and every form of their heart's planning was only evil all the day. <sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Then YHVH was sorry that he had made the Earthling on earth, and it pained his heart. <sup>7</sup>&nbsp;YHVH said: "I will blot out the Earthling, whom I have created, from the face of the fertile-ground, from human to herd-animal, to crawling thing and to the birds of the sky, for I am sorry that I made them." <sup>8</sup>&nbsp;But Noaḥ found favor in the eyes of YHVH.</span>[foot]The J section ends in vs. 8 with a statement of Noah finding favor in Yhwh's eyes, Noah is previously mentioned in J's birth notice appropriated into the P genealogy of Chapter 5. Vs. 9 launches into Noah's genealogy beginning with אלה תולדות – "these are the generations" formula, repeating the final verses of chapter 5, a fitting segue to vs. 8. The fracture between J and P is, however, quite apparent. Noah is righteous in vs. 9, while J explicitly mentions that all of humanity is evil (vss.  5-7), even Noah, who perhaps finds favor in Yhwh's eyes  is not exempt from this moral pronouncement. Noah's drunkenness in Chapter 9 certainly doesn't reflect well on him. The deity's name switches abruptly from "the Lord" vs. 8 to "God" in vs. 9. The following verses 9-22 command Noah to build the ark, and provide him with very ordered and detailed instructions, as opposed to the sketchy details in the J version at the beginning of Chapter 7. This is reminiscent of the ordered and detailed Priestly creation account as opposed to the story-like account of J's creation narrative.[/foot]

The Masoretic text presented here is from Rabbi Dr. Seth (Avi) Kadish's <a href="https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/פרשת_בראשית/טעמים">Miqra al pi ha-Mesorah</a>. For the translation in English, I have adapted the translation of Everett Fox in the <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/series/DA5/the-schocken-bible">Schocken Bible</a> (1997), mostly to re-Hebraize divine names, but I have made other changes. In place of Fox's "humanity" and "the human" for the translation for "ha-Adam," I have chosen "the Earthling." In place of "begetting" for <em>toldot</em>, I have chosen "progeny." And in place of "soil" (for Adamah), I have chosen "fertile-ground" in almost every instance, as well as emphasizing the feminine gender of Adamah, which seems to me important for this mythopoetic narrative. (Later in the Pentateuch, I use "fertile-earth" for <em>adamah</em>.) By replacing "snake" with a transliteration of its Hebrew naḥash, I mean to draw attention to the word's cognate in Sanskrit, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nāga">naga</a> (नाग), a serpent-like being whose echo in Indian mythology seems strongly related. In place of "Ocean" for Tehom, I use "Abyss" and in place of "wild and waste" for "tohu v'bohu, I use 'chaos and inchoate.' Aside from these, I have made minor punctuation changes.
