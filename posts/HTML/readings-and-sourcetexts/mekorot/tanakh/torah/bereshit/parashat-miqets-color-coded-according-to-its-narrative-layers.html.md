According to the poetry of the Midrash Tanchuma, Bereshit 1:1, the words of the Torah were inscribed "black fire on white fire." For many years, I've wanted to look deeply into the black fire and visualize the full spectrum of the Torah's sources, hidden within the black fire but revealed through  a critical analysis of its layers of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redaction_criticism">redaction</a>. Below, I've set the text of the first Torah portion in the annual Torah reading cycle, using color-coding to distinguish the stratigraphic layers forming the composition of the Masoretic text according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplementary_hypothesis">Supplementary Hypothesis</a> presented by Tsemaḥ Yoreh in his <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=tpLIngEACAAJ">Kernel to Canon</a> series of books (2013-2017). As Dr. Yoreh explains, 

<blockquote>The Supplementary Hypothesis asserts that the Pentateuch was composed by several different writers. This reflects an overwhelming academic consensus on Biblical authorship, even among scholars who do not subscribe to the Supplementary Hypothesis in particular.[....] According to the Supplementary Hypothesis, Biblical narrative is layered. No editor took a blowtorch to the parts of the Bible he disagreed with and destroyed them; if he had, we would not find these repetitions and contradictions. Instead, Biblical narrative began with a coherent, foundational bedrock, which over time accreted more and more storylines. Unlike geological processes, though, this process of addition was deliberate. What happened if one author disagreed with his predecessor’s storyline or worldview? He did not simply take an axe to the narrative; instead, he attempted to bury his predecessor’s point of view by repeating his own over and over again, thus skewing our understanding of the story in new ways. Every generation of readers sees the world differently, and thus every generation of writers seeks to adapt their predecessors’ cultural heritage to their own situation. We are not meant simply to dismiss earlier stories; rather, the intention of later writers is to transform our understanding of those stories via their additions.</blockquote>

<span class="e">&#11035; The kernel of biblical text upon which all other narratives were laid is thought to have been composed in the mid- to late eighth century BCE toward the end of the heyday of the northern Kingdom of Ephraim (one of the two kingdoms that occupied Biblical Israel). This layer, commonly referred to as 'E', is indicated with INDIGO text. The first parashah containing text of this layer is <a href="https://opensiddur.org/liturgical-readings/torah-readings/annual-cycle/sefer-bereshit/parashat-vayera/parashat-vayera-color-coded-according-to-its-narrative-layers/">parashat Vayera</a>.</span>

<span class="j">&#11035; The next oldest layer is thought to have been composed in the late eighth or early seventh century BCE in the southern Kingdom of Judah. This layer, commonly known as 'J', is indicated with a BLUE text.</span> 

<span class="b">&#11035; The most recent layer of text, is a post-exilic (pre-3rd century BCE) text that Dr. Yoreh refers to as the "Bridger" which supplements earlier strata with genealogies and popular myths, providing narrative bridges between distant story cycles. This 'B' layer is presented here in FUCHSIA.</span>

Parashat Miqets (Genesis 41:1-44:17) in the annual Torah reading cycle, is read on the fourth shabbat of the month of Kislev. The parashah is preceded by <a href="https://opensiddur.org/readings-and-sourcetexts/torah-readings/annual-cycle/sefer-bereshit/parashat-vayeshev/parashat-vayeshev-color-coded-according-to-its-narrative-layers/">Vayeshev</a> (Genesis 37:1–40:23); parashat <a href="https://opensiddur.org/readings-and-sourcetexts/torah-readings/annual-cycle/sefer-bereshit/parashat-vayigash/parashat-vayigash-color-coded-according-to-its-narrative-layers/">Vayigash</a> (Genesis 44:18–47:27) follows it.

Their hearts gave way, and they trembled to one another, saying: "What is this that Elohim has done to us?"</span>[foot]The sacks are discovered twice, once on the way (vss. 27-28), then again when they get back to Canaan (vs. 35). The second discovery does not assume the first, indicating that perhaps the first was a later addition. The first discovery is couched using the anomalous term אמתחות for sacks. Note also that no specific brother makes the statement – one of them does – conveying an anonymity not found in the rest of the Joseph cycle, where either all the brothers speak together, or one of the brothers is identified as the speaker (either Reuben, Judah, or Joseph). The discovery of the sacks during the journey which is reminiscent of Balaam's adventure with his donkey during the journey to Moab in Numbers 22. Both fill in the events of a journey otherwise described in one verse and create tension within the text and both reflect a later stage of composition (the term אמתחות, appears below in identifiably later layers). I tentatively assign this passage to the late Bridging source (as I do the Balaam narrative) since J and P are unlikely candidates (vs. 28 employs the name "God" for the deity, and there is no identifiably priestly language).[/foot] <span class="j"> <sup>29</sup>&nbsp;They came home to Yaakov their father, in the land of K'naan, and told him all that had befallen them, saying: <sup>30</sup>&nbsp;"The man, the lord of the land, spoke harshly with us, he took us for those that spy on the land! <sup>31</sup>&nbsp;Now we said to him: 'We are honest, we have never been spies! <sup>32</sup>&nbsp;We are twelve, brothers all, sons of our father: one is no more, and the youngest is now with our father in the land of K'naan.' <sup>33</sup>&nbsp;Then the man, the lord of the land, said to us: 'Hereby shall I know whether you are honest: Leave one of your brothers with me, and as for the famine-supply of your households, take it and go. <sup>34</sup>&nbsp;But bring your youngest brother back to me, so that I may know that you are not spies, that you are honest. (Then) I will give your brother back to you, and you may travel about the land.'"</span>[foot]The recap of their journey for Jacob's benefit is likely a J addition. The name Jacob (as opposed to E's Israel) appears as does 12 for the number of the brothers. There is no mention of Joseph's father in E until he sees descends to Egypt to see Joseph.[/foot]

Joseph's father asks Judah a question (Why did you tell them about Benjamin?) he'd already heard the answer to in the report the brothers give in Chapter 42. The use of the name Israel in these verses, as well as the Priestly "El Shadday" (God Almighty") militates against attributing this section to J. The rare term אמתחת (sacks) appears here once again (vs. 12) - its previous occurrence was in Chapter 42 in a section we attributed to the Bridging source. Note also the use of זמרת הארץ (the choice of the land), an expression which one finds only here. Judah's use of the root ערב, "to ransom" is reminiscent of ערבון (pledge) in Chapter 38:20, also attributed to the Bridger. Our tentative conclusion is therefore an assignment of this section to B. I believe this dialogue was added to the text because B viewed a simple capitulation by Jacob (J's version of events) as unlikely, and therefore added this dialogue in which Jacob verbally agrees to let Benjamin go.[/foot]

The Masoretic text presented here is from Rabbi Dr. Seth (Avi) Kadish's <a href="https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/פרשת_מקץ/טעמים">Miqra al pi ha-Mesorah</a>. For the translation in English, I have adapted the translation of Everett Fox in the <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/series/DA5/the-schocken-bible">Schocken Bible</a> (1997), mostly to re-Hebraize divine names, place names, and personal names, but I have made other changes. I have slightly modified the translation of the verse for Genesis 42:13 to accomodate the findings of the Supplementary hypothesis. Aside from these, I have made minor punctuation changes.
