This is an English translation of the Torah reading for Simḥat Torah Morning (Genesis 1:1-2:3), transtropilized by Len Fellman. (Transtropilation is translating from cantillated Hebrew, as closely as possible, “word for word and <em>trōp</em> for <em>trōp</em>”, with the main purpose being to aid a person with minimal Hebrew training in following the Hebrew leyning word for word.) This translation is based on the translations by H.L. Ginsberg, Stone Ed. Tanach, Jerusalem Bible, New King James Bible, and the JPS Tanach (both 1917 & 1985).

Please visit the <a href="https://archive.org/details/simhat-torah-morning-torah-reading-with-english-transtropilation-len-fellman-2018">Internet Archive</a> for audio recordings of the aliyot readings in both English and Hebrew.
