According to the poetry of the Midrash Tanchuma, Bereshit 1:1, the words of the Torah were inscribed "black fire on white fire." For many years, I've wanted to look deeply into the black fire and visualize the full spectrum of the Torah's sources, hidden within the black fire but revealed through  a critical analysis of its layers of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redaction_criticism">redaction</a>. Below, I've set the text of the first Torah portion in the annual Torah reading cycle, using color-coding to distinguish the stratigraphic layers forming the composition of the Masoretic text according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplementary_hypothesis">Supplementary Hypothesis</a> presented by Tsemaḥ Yoreh in his <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=tpLIngEACAAJ">Kernel to Canon</a> series of books (2013-2017). As Dr. Yoreh explains, 

<blockquote>The Supplementary Hypothesis asserts that the Pentateuch was composed by several different writers. This reflects an overwhelming academic consensus on Biblical authorship, even among scholars who do not subscribe to the Supplementary Hypothesis in particular.[....] According to the Supplementary Hypothesis, Biblical narrative is layered. No editor took a blowtorch to the parts of the Bible he disagreed with and destroyed them; if he had, we would not find these repetitions and contradictions. Instead, Biblical narrative began with a coherent, foundational bedrock, which over time accreted more and more storylines. Unlike geological processes, though, this process of addition was deliberate. What happened if one author disagreed with his predecessor’s storyline or worldview? He did not simply take an axe to the narrative; instead, he attempted to bury his predecessor’s point of view by repeating his own over and over again, thus skewing our understanding of the story in new ways. Every generation of readers sees the world differently, and thus every generation of writers seeks to adapt their predecessors’ cultural heritage to their own situation. We are not meant simply to dismiss earlier stories; rather, the intention of later writers is to transform our understanding of those stories via their additions.</blockquote>

<span class="e">&#11035; Appearing for the first time in Sefer Bereshit with Parashat Vayera is the kernel of biblical text upon which all other narratives were laid, thought to have been composed in the mid- to late eighth century BCE toward the end of the heyday of the northern Kingdom of Ephraim (one of the two kingdoms that occupied Biblical Israel). This layer, commonly referred to as 'E', is indicated with INDIGO text.</span>

<span class="j">&#11035; The next oldest layer is thought to have been composed in the late eighth or early seventh century BCE in the southern Kingdom of Judah. This layer, commonly known as 'J', is indicated with a BLUE text.</span> 

<span class="p">&#11035; The next strata, thought to have been composed during the exilic to early post-exilic period (571–486 BCE) is, as Dr. Yoreh explains, "responsible for supplementing the 'J' narrative with dates, names, and numbers, thus 'ordering' and authenticating 'J's account." This layer, commonly referred to as 'P' (for 'Priestly') appears here in GREEN text.</span>

<span class="b">&#11035; The most recent layer of text, is a post-exilic (pre-3rd century BCE) text that Dr. Yoreh refers to as the "Bridger" which supplements earlier strata with genealogies and popular myths, providing narrative bridges between distant story cycles. This 'B' layer is presented here in FUCHSIA.</span>

Parashat Vayera (Genesis 18:1-22:24) in the annual Torah reading cycle, is read on the third shabbat of the month of Marḥeshvan. The parashah is preceded by <a href="https://opensiddur.org/liturgical-readings/torah-readings/annual-cycle/sefer-bereshit/parashat-lekh-lekha/parashat-lekh-lekha-color-coded-according-to-its-narrative-layers/">Parashat Lekh Lekha</a> (Genesis 12:1-17:27); <a href="https://opensiddur.org/liturgical-readings/torah-readings/annual-cycle/sefer-bereshit/parashat-hayyei-sarah/parashat-hayyei-sarah-color-coded-according-to-its-narrative-layers/">parashat Ḥayyei Sarah</a> (Genesis 23:1-25:18) follows it.

The chapter is anthropomorphically ambivalent; there are three angelic figures that appear throughout the story, one of which may be the Lord, but not necessarily. 3. The promise vocabulary is typically Yahwistic, thus vs. 18: "Abraham shall become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him". 4. It continues the narrative thread of Chapter 16 - Sarah is still barren; 5.

No such place is present in the canonical text. The expression is thus an artificial device meant to connect this text with previous narratives, much like: אחר הדברים האלה (after these occurrences or this speech) in 22:1. Since this is the first Elohistic narrative, and the Elohistic narrative is the oldest of the sources, the words "From there" were probably added by a redactor attempting to contextualize this narrative within the framework of the Abraham Cycle.[/foot] <span class="e">to the Negev, and settled between Ḳadesh and Shur, sojourning in Gerar. <sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Avraham said of Sarah his wife: "She is my sister." So Avimelekh king of Gerar sent and had Sarah taken. <sup>3</sup>&nbsp;But Elohim came to Avimelekh in a dream of the night and said to him: "Here, you must die because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is a wedded wife!"</span>[foot]God frequently appears to characters within dreams in E narratives. Thus the angels of Jacob's ladder in Genesis 28:10-21 or God appearing to Balaam warning him not to curse the Israelites in Num 22:9-21. ¶ Elohistic narratives are usually very terse, imparting only the most basic information necessary for the advancement of the plot, thus Abraham's arrival, the ruse, and the taking of Sarah to Abimelech's house all occur within two verses.[/foot] <span class="j"><sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Avimelekh had not come near her. He said: "My Lord, would you kill a nation, though it be innocent? <sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Did he not say to me: 'She is my sister,' and also she, she said: 'He is my brother!' With a whole heart and with clean hands have I done this." <sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Elohim said to him in the dream: "I also know that it was with a whole heart that you did this, and so I also held you back from being at fault against me, therefore I did not let you touch her.</span>[foot]Abimelech answers God's accusations and protests his innocence of malfeasance. This dream dialogue is in fact sui generis in the Bible. There is literally no other occasion of such give and take between the deity and humans in a dream revelation such as this, it is almost as if Abimelech were on the stand instead of asleep in his bed. The author, cognizant of this anomaly conscientiously reminds the reader through a resumptive repetition that Abimelech is still in a dream (vs. 6 Then God said to Him in the dream). Abimelech quotes an imaginary statement, supposedly made by Sarah, of which there is no record in the text, it strengthens his protestation of innocence, but sits uneasily in the text. For these reasons it seems likely that this jural dialogue was added on by a second author.[/foot] <span class="e"><sup>7</sup>&nbsp;But now, return the man's wife – indeed, he is a prophet, he can intercede for you – and live! But if you do not return her: know that you must die, yes, die, you and all that is yours!"</span>

"And Abimelech said to Abraham, “What were you thinking of, that you did this thing?”" ¶ The first is very melodramatic, the second is very terse.

Here it appears for the first time: "Abraham said, “I did it because I thought, there is no fear of God at all in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife."[/foot] <span class="b"><sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Then, too, she is truly my sister, my father's daughter, however not my mother's daughter – so she became my wife. <sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Now it was, when Elohim caused me to roam from my father's house, that I said to her: 'Let this be the faithfulness that you do me: in every place that we come, say of me: He is my brother.'"</span>[foot]Vss. 12-13 are a second moralistic excuse for Abraham's actions. It is quite clearly a secondary addition to the text, and is phrased as such: "Besides, she is indeed my sister…" No such relationship is recorded elsewhere in Genesis; cohabitation with ones sister may be a mythic detail [compare the incestuous marriages among gods in many mythologies]. Vs. 14, provides the global background for Abraham's behavior and knows of the parallel narrative in Genesis 12:10-20. I attribute these verses to the Bridger seeking to unify the Abraham narratives.[/foot]

In J the pact carries a broader significance. J refers to the Gerar (Abimelech's city) as the land of the Philistines and Abimelech as the king of the Philistines in 26:1. In J Abraham makes a non-aggression covenant with Abimelech, implying that Abimelech and the Philistines have the right to reside in the land of Canaan, which is contra the Lord's promise to Abraham in 13:16-18. These are the same Philistines who will prove to be Israel's toughest enemy throughout Judges and Samuel according to J. J thus takes the very long view of what goes around comes around: Abraham made a covenant with Abimelech abrogating God's promise (to a degree), and these same Philistines will threaten Israel's survival in the land time and time again. This is a frequent literary device throughout J, e.g. Laban cheats Jacob by giving him Leah, so Jacob in turn cheats Laban by purloining his flock through tricks of animal husbandry.

The Masoretic text presented here is from Rabbi Dr. Seth (Avi) Kadish's <a href="https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/פרשת_וירא/טעמים">Miqra al pi ha-Mesorah</a>. For the translation in English, I have adapted the translation of Everett Fox in the <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/series/DA5/the-schocken-bible">Schocken Bible</a> (1997), mostly to re-Hebraize divine names, place names, and personal names, but I have made other changes. In place of "slaughter-site," I have offered "place-for-slaughter." And in place of "soil" (for Adamah), I have chosen "fertile-ground." Aside from these, I have made minor punctuation changes.
