According to the poetry of the Midrash Tanchuma, Bereshit 1:1, the words of the Torah were inscribed "black fire on white fire." For many years, I've wanted to look deeply into the black fire and visualize the full spectrum of the Torah's sources, hidden within the black fire but revealed through  a critical analysis of its layers of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redaction_criticism">redaction</a>. Below, I've set the text of the first Torah portion in the annual Torah reading cycle, using color-coding to distinguish the stratigraphic layers forming the composition of the Masoretic text according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplementary_hypothesis">Supplementary Hypothesis</a> presented by Tsemaḥ Yoreh in his <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=tpLIngEACAAJ">Kernel to Canon</a> series of books (2013-2017). As Dr. Yoreh explains, 

<blockquote>The Supplementary Hypothesis asserts that the Pentateuch was composed by several different writers. This reflects an overwhelming academic consensus on Biblical authorship, even among scholars who do not subscribe to the Supplementary Hypothesis in particular.[....] According to the Supplementary Hypothesis, Biblical narrative is layered. No editor took a blowtorch to the parts of the Bible he disagreed with and destroyed them; if he had, we would not find these repetitions and contradictions. Instead, Biblical narrative began with a coherent, foundational bedrock, which over time accreted more and more storylines. Unlike geological processes, though, this process of addition was deliberate. What happened if one author disagreed with his predecessor’s storyline or worldview? He did not simply take an axe to the narrative; instead, he attempted to bury his predecessor’s point of view by repeating his own over and over again, thus skewing our understanding of the story in new ways. Every generation of readers sees the world differently, and thus every generation of writers seeks to adapt their predecessors’ cultural heritage to their own situation. We are not meant simply to dismiss earlier stories; rather, the intention of later writers is to transform our understanding of those stories via their additions.</blockquote>

<span class="e">&#11035; The kernel of biblical text upon which all other narratives were laid is thought to have been composed in the mid- to late eighth century BCE toward the end of the heyday of the northern Kingdom of Ephraim (one of the two kingdoms that occupied Biblical Israel). This layer, commonly referred to as 'E', is indicated with INDIGO text. The first parashah containing text of this layer was <a href="https://opensiddur.org/liturgical-readings/torah-readings/annual-cycle/sefer-bereshit/parashat-vayera/parashat-vayera-color-coded-according-to-its-narrative-layers/">parashat Vayera</a>.</span>

<span class="j">&#11035; The next oldest layer is thought to have been composed in the late eighth or early seventh century BCE in the southern Kingdom of Judah. This layer, commonly known as 'J', is indicated with a BLUE text.</span> 

<span class="p">&#11035; The next strata, thought to have been composed during the exilic to early post-exilic period (571–486 BCE) is, as Dr. Yoreh explains, "responsible for supplementing the 'J' narrative with dates, names, and numbers, thus 'ordering' and authenticating 'J's account." This layer, commonly referred to as 'P' (for 'Priestly') appears here in GREEN text.</span>

<span class="b">&#11035; The most recent layer of text, is a post-exilic (pre-3rd century BCE) text that Dr. Yoreh refers to as the "Bridger" which supplements earlier strata with genealogies and popular myths, providing narrative bridges between distant story cycles. This 'B' layer is presented here in FUCHSIA.</span>

<span class="u">&#11035; An unknown, unattributed post-exilic (pre-3rd century BCE) addition is found in this parashah (Genesis 48:22). This verse is identified in RED.</span>

Parashat Vayeḥi (Genesis 47:28-50:26) in the annual Torah reading cycle, is read on the second shabbat of the month of Tevet. The parashah is preceded by <a href="https://opensiddur.org/readings-and-sourcetexts/torah-readings/annual-cycle/sefer-bereshit/parashat-vayigash/parashat-vayigash-color-coded-according-to-its-narrative-layers/">Vayigash</a> (Genesis 44:18-47:27); parashat <a href="https://opensiddur.org/readings-and-sourcetexts/weekly-torah-readings/annual-cycle/sefer-shemot/parashat-shemot/parashat-shemot-color-coded-according-to-its-narrative-layers/">Shemot</a> (Exodus 1:1-6:1) in Sefer Shemot (the book of Exodus) follows it.

Note that Israel does not recognize Menasseh and Ephraim; this would be hardly likely had he’d been living in Egypt for 17 years as recounted by P at the end of Chapter 47.[/foot] <span class="p"><sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Yaakov said to Yosef: "El Shaddai was seen by me in Luz, in the land of K'naan; he blessed me <sup>4</sup>&nbsp;and he said to me: 'Here, I will make you bear fruit and will make you many, and will make you into a host of peoples; I will give this land to your seed after you, as a holding for the ages!' <sup>5</sup>&nbsp;So now, your two sons who were born to you in the land of Mitsrayim before I came to you in Mitsrayim, they are mine, Efrayim and Menasheh, like Re'uven and Shim'on, let them be mine! <sup>6</sup>&nbsp;But your begotten sons, whom you will beget after them, let them be yours; by their brothers' names let them be called, respecting their inheritance. <sup>7</sup>&nbsp;While I – when I came back from that country, Raḥel died on me, in the land of K'naan, on the way, with still a stretch of land left to come to Efrat. There I buried her, on the way to Efrat – that is now Beit Laḥem."</span>[foot]A Priestly insertion alluding to the revelation of Chapter 35 and the promise of progeny there (note the typical Priestly vocabulary such as El Shaddai [compare 28:3] – God Almighty, and the allusion to Paddan, Laban’s dwelling in P [e.g. 28:2]). This insertion explains the emergence of Menasseh and Ephraim as two separate tribes, instead of two families within the tribe of Joseph, a distinction not necessarily extant in earlier sources such as J and E.[/foot]

<span class="e"><sup>8</sup>&nbsp;When Yisrael saw Yosef's sons, he said: "Who are these?" <sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Yosef said to his father: "They are my sons, whom Elohim has given me here." He said: "Pray take them over to me, that I may give-them-blessing." <sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Now Yisrael's eyes were heavy with age, he was not able to see. He brought them close to him, and he kissed them and embraced them. <sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Yisrael said to Yosef: "I never thought to see your face (again), and here, Elohim has let me see your seed as well!" <sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Yosef took them from between his knees and they bowed low, their brows to the ground. <sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Yosef took the two of them, Efrayim with his right-hand, to Yisrael's left, and Menasheh with his left-hand, to Yisrael's right, and brought them close to him. <sup>14</sup>&nbsp;But Yisrael stretched out his right-hand and put it on the head of Efrayim – yet he was the younger! – and his left-hand on the head of Menasheh; he crossed his arms, although Menasheh was the firstborn.</span>[foot]Note the appearance of Israel and Elohim/God in tandem indicating the E source. The blessing of Joseph’s progeny is a reflection of the importance of the tribe of Joseph to the Northern Elohistic author. Indeed the Israelites are referred to as Joseph or Ephraim in the prophets. In the E version, Jacob does not bless his other sons, only Joseph and his children.[/foot] <span class="p"><sup>15</sup>&nbsp;Then he blessed Yosef and said: "Elohim in whose presence my fathers walked, Avraham and Yitsḥaq, Elohim who has tended me ever since I was (born), until this day – <sup>16</sup>&nbsp;the messenger who has redeemed me from all ill-fortune, may he bless the lads! May my name continue to be called through them and the name of my fathers, Avraham and Yitsḥaq! May they teem-like-fish to (become) many in the midst of the land!"</span>[foot]Note the discrepancy between vs. 14 and 15, in vs. 15 Jacob blesses Joseph, whereas in vs. 14 he was preparing to bless Menasseh and Ephraim, which he proceeds to do in vs. 17. The allusion to Abraham and Isaac as Jacob’s forefathers is also post-elohistic, since in E Jacob is the Israelite progenitor and their names aren’t mentioned. It may be attributable to the Priestly author although no firm linguistic markers can be identified. There are, however, allusions to the Priestly section of vss. 3-8, Jacob is blessing his son in the same way God Almighty blessed him in Luz, and his father Isaac blessed him in Beer-Sheva before Jacob left (that he may proliferate).[/foot]

The promise to bring Joseph's bones back to Canaan is repeated again in Exodus 13:17-19, and once more at the end of Joshua 24. These statements are typical Bridging comments, connecting between disparate narrative cycles, in this case the patriarchal period is connected to the Exodus and the occupation of Canaan.

From this point onwards, the Israelites are referred to as a national group, and compare the following E episode in Exodus 1:8ff. For the sake of a smoother read, the Priestly author adds a transitional section describing how the Israelites became a nation (Exodus 1:1-1:7).[/foot]

The Masoretic text presented here is from Rabbi Dr. Seth (Avi) Kadish's <a href="https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/פרשת_ויחי/טעמים">Miqra al pi ha-Mesorah</a>. For the translation in English, I have adapted the translation of Everett Fox in the <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/series/DA5/the-schocken-bible">Schocken Bible</a> (1997), mostly to re-Hebraize divine names, place names, and personal names, but I have made other changes. Where Fox translated "Mitsrayim" as 'Egyptians,' I have kept "Mitsrayim, and where he has 'coffin,' I have replaced this with 'sarcophagus.' Aside from these, I have made minor punctuation changes.
