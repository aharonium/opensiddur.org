According to the poetry of the Midrash Tanḥuma, Bereshit 1:1, the words of the Torah were inscribed "black fire on white fire." For many years, I've wanted to look deeply into the black fire and visualize the full spectrum of the Torah's sources, hidden within the black fire but revealed through  a critical analysis of its layers of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redaction_criticism">redaction</a>. Below, I've set the text of the Torah portion in the annual Torah reading cycle, using color-coding to distinguish the stratigraphic layers forming the composition of the Masoretic text according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplementary_hypothesis">Supplementary Hypothesis</a> presented by Tsemaḥ Yoreh in his <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=tpLIngEACAAJ">Kernel to Canon</a> series of books (2013-2017) and his website, <a href="http://www.biblecriticism.com/supplementary_index.html">the Sources of Biblical Narrative</a>. As Dr. Yoreh explains, 

<blockquote>The Supplementary Hypothesis asserts that the Pentateuch was composed by several different writers. This reflects an overwhelming academic consensus on Biblical authorship, even among scholars who do not subscribe to the Supplementary Hypothesis in particular.[....] According to the Supplementary Hypothesis, Biblical narrative is layered. No editor took a blowtorch to the parts of the Bible he disagreed with and destroyed them; if he had, we would not find these repetitions and contradictions. Instead, Biblical narrative began with a coherent, foundational bedrock, which over time accreted more and more storylines. Unlike geological processes, though, this process of addition was deliberate. What happened if one author disagreed with his predecessor’s storyline or worldview? He did not simply take an axe to the narrative; instead, he attempted to bury his predecessor’s point of view by repeating his own over and over again, thus skewing our understanding of the story in new ways. Every generation of readers sees the world differently, and thus every generation of writers seeks to adapt their predecessors’ cultural heritage to their own situation. We are not meant simply to dismiss earlier stories; rather, the intention of later writers is to transform our understanding of those stories via their additions.</blockquote>

<span class="e">&#11035; The kernel of biblical text upon which all other narratives were laid is thought to have been composed in the mid- to late eighth century BCE toward the end of the heyday of the northern Kingdom of Ephraim (one of the two kingdoms that occupied Biblical Israel). This layer, commonly referred to as 'E', is indicated with INDIGO text. The first parashah containing text of this layer was <a href="https://opensiddur.org/liturgical-readings/torah-readings/annual-cycle/sefer-bereshit/parashat-vayera/parashat-vayera-color-coded-according-to-its-narrative-layers/">parashat Vayera</a> in Sefer Bereshit.</span>

<span class="j">&#11035; The next oldest layer is thought to have been composed in the late 8th or early 7th century BCE in the southern Kingdom of Judah. This layer, commonly known as 'J', is indicated with a BLUE text.</span>

<span class="p">&#11035; This strata, thought to have been composed during the exilic to early post-exilic period (571–486 BCE) is, as Dr. Yoreh explains, "responsible for supplementing the 'J' narrative with dates, names, and numbers, thus 'ordering' and authenticating 'J's account." This layer, commonly referred to as 'P' (for 'Priestly') appears here in GREEN text.</span>

<span class="h">&#11035; The next strata popularized Kohanite law for the remnant of Judah after the Temple was destroyed, and functioned as an intermediary between Kohanite lists and laws and the surrounding narrative. This layer, which Dr. Yoreh calls 'H' (for the 'Holiness Code') appears here in LIME-GREEN text.</span>

<span class="b">&#11035; The most recent layer of text, is a post-exilic (pre-3rd century BCE) text that Dr. Yoreh refers to as the "Bridger" which supplements earlier strata with genealogies and popular myths, providing narrative bridges between distant story cycles. This 'B' layer is presented here in FUCHSIA.</span>

Parashat Ki Tissa <span class="citation">(Exodus 30:11-34:35)</span> in the annual Torah reading cycle, is read on the third shabbat of the month of Adar (or Adar Alef in a Jewish leap year). The parashah is preceded by parashat <a href="https://opensiddur.org/readings-and-sourcetexts/weekly-torah-readings/annual-cycle/sefer-shemot/parashat-ttsavveh/parashat-ttsavveh-color-coded-according-to-its-narrative-layers/">T'tsavveh</a> <span class="citation">(Exodus 27:20-30:10)</span>; parashat <a href="https://opensiddur.org/readings-and-sourcetexts/weekly-torah-readings/annual-cycle/sefer-shemot/parashat-vayaqhel/parashat-vayaqhel-color-coded-according-to-its-narrative-layers/">Vayaqhel</a> <span class="citation">(Exodus 35:1-38:20)</span> follows it. Exodus 33:12-34:26 is read on Sukkot Shabbat Ḥol haMo'ed, the shabbat immediately preceding Simḥat Torah on which Parashat <a href="https://opensiddur.org/readings-and-sourcetexts/mekorot/tanakh/torah/devarim/parashat-vzot-habrakhah-color-coded-according-to-its-narrative-layers/">Zot haBrakhah</a> is read.

<span class="p">30 <sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Now YHVH spoke to Mosheh, saying: <sup>12</sup>&nbsp;"When you take up the head-count of the Children of Yisrael, in counting them, they are to give, each-man, a ransom for his life, for YHVH, when they count them, that there be no plague on them, when they count them. <sup>13</sup>&nbsp;This (is what) they are to give, everyone that goes through the counting: half a sheqel of the Holy-shrine sheqel — twenty grains to the sheqel — half a sheqel, a contribution for YHVH. <sup>14</sup>&nbsp;Everyone that goes through the counting, from the age of twenty years and upward, is to give the contribution of YHVH. <sup>15</sup>&nbsp;The rich are not to pay-more and the poor are not to pay-less than half a sheqel when giving the contribution of YHVH, to effect-ransom for your lives. <sup>16</sup>&nbsp;You are to take the silver for ransoming from the Children of Yisrael and are to give it over for the construction-service of the Ohel Mo'ed, that it may be for the Children of Yisrael as a remembrance before the presence of YHVH, to effect-ransom for your lives."[foot]Following the instructions construction of the Tabernacle and the investment of Aharon, P demands a further monetary donation from the Yisraelites, a ransom for the future census. This is quite curious considering that the two censuses in Numbers 1 and in Numbers 26 are both prescribed by God. It seems that P is closing a literary circle here, P begins the construction of the Tabernacle with a call for donations at the beginning of Exodus 25 and ends it with a call for donations, this time guaranteeing the Tabernacle’s financial viability.[/foot]</span>

<span class="h"><sup>17</sup>&nbsp;Now YHVH spoke to Mosheh, saying: <sup>18</sup>&nbsp;"You are to make a Kiyor/Basin of N'ḥōshet/bronze, its Khan/pedestal of bronze, for washing, and you are to put it between the Ohel Mo'ed and the Mizbe'aḥ; you are to put water therein, <sup>19</sup>&nbsp;that Aharon and his sons may wash with it their hands and their feet. <sup>20</sup>&nbsp;When they come into the Ohel Mo'ed they are to wash with water so that they do not die, or when they approach the Mizbe'aḥ, to be-in-attendance, to send up fire-offerings in smoke for YHVH, <sup>21</sup>&nbsp;they are to wash their hands and their feet, so that they do not die. It is to be for them a law for the ages, for him and for his sons, throughout their generations."[foot]There are a number of reasons to posit that this is a further H addition to the text. A second cultic object (the basin) is mentioned here, once again out of place (the construction of cultic objects was dealt with in Chapter 25), and see the penultimate comment in T'tsavveh. Moreover, Aharon’s sons are mentioned here (in vss. 19-21) and it is quite clear that they were an addition to Chapters 28-29, as part of H’s general tendency to apply Priestly laws to the cult of subsequent generations. This is further emphasized by H’s statement that this ordinance to wash is a perpetual statute, a phrase which is a linguistic/ideological marker of this source.<p />The connection between the H additions to this chapter and Numbers 16-17 (Korach and the offering of the incense) is solidified here by mentioning that anybody who doesn’t properly approach YHVH is liable to be killed: So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they not die: and it shall be a statute forever to them, even to him and to his descendants throughout their generations.[/foot]</span>

<span class="e">32 <sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Now when the people saw that Mosheh was shamefully-late in coming down from the mountain, the people assembled against Aharon[foot]In the midrash aggadah, this danger attracts a supernatural valence: before Aharon is made the mob's servant, <span class="hebrew" lang="he">בָּא שָׂטָן וְעִרְבֵּב אֶת הָעוֹלָם, וְהֶרְאָה דְּמוּת חֹשֶׁךְ וַאֲפֵלָה וְעִרְבּוּבְיָה</span> "Satan came and threw the world into confusion, giving it the appearance of darkness, gloom, and disorder" (Rashi on Exodus 32:1). Ḥur, grandfather of Betsalel, is murdered by zealots intent on his making for them an <em>elohim</em> (Sanhedrin 7a; Targum Jonathan on Exodus 32:1, Vayikra Rabbah 10:3). What is the relationship between idolatry and authority suggested here? I believe it's a common and obscene tactic for a political authority, class, or caste to self-validate its own power and prestige by idealizing its representation as righteous and/or divine. But here, the narrative suggests that idolatry (in some form or another) will manifest when authority is subverted by the confused mob. (The aspiration for an enlightened populace sans-authority is found both in the response of Mosheh to the prophesyzing of Eldad and Medad in Numbers 11:26-29, as well as in the challenge posed by Qoraḥ in Numbers 16:3.) The polemic here is as in Judges 17:6 and 21:25, <span class="hebrew" lang="he">בַּיָּמִים הָהֵם אֵין מֶלֶךְ בְּיִשְׂרָאֵל אִישׁ הַיָּשָׁר בְּעֵינָיו יַעֲשֶׂה</span> -- "In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did that which was right in his own eyes" (contra Samuel's warning against kings in 1 Samuel 8:10-22). A similar tragic view of human predilictions is developed in 3 Enoch, where the etiology of star worship is explained as a human reaction to the retreat of the Shekhinah beyond the realm of the planetary stars, and humanity begins to direct its worship towards the angels (the spirit of the stars) in her absence. This tragedy underscores the conflict between human need for divine protection in their existential vulnerability and theological confusion in the aftermath of a profound theophany. --ANV[/foot] and said to him: "Arise, make us <em>Elohim</em>[foot]I have not translated this verse, "make us a god." This verse to me is powerfully ambiguous, an expression of sacred anthropogenic poesis. Is 'elohim' here a reference to a generic deity or to plural deities as in 34:15 (i.e., "craft for us a deity/deities"), or to Elohim ("craft for us a representation of Elohim") -- an appeal to conventional modes of popular worship via concrete representation? or is it invoking the <em>creator</em> god Elohim in an even more nuanced way, declaring to the pious listener what should sound as plainly absurd: "<em>make</em> us Elohim!" -- satirizing the perspective of the idolater? For a generic deity/deities, I spell 'elohim' in lowercase; otherwise for 'Elohim,' the E is capitalized. --ANV[/foot] who will go before us, for this Mosheh, the man who brought us up from the land of Mitsrayim, we do not know what has become of him!" <sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Aharon said to them: "Break off the gold rings that are in the ears of your wives, your sons and your daughters, and bring (them) to me." <sup>3</sup>&nbsp;All the people broke off the gold rings that were in their ears, and brought (them) to Aharon. <sup>4</sup>&nbsp;He took (them) from their hand, fashioned it with a graving-tool, and made it into a molten calf. Then they said: "This is your <em>elo'ah</em>, O Yisrael, who brought you up from the land of Mitsrayim!"[foot]Moses did not tell the people when he was planning to come down and thus they were apprehensive, despite the provisional leadership he'd installed according to E's Exodus 24:13-14. The golden calf is, of course, reminiscent of the northern calves installed by Jeroboam I in the North (according to I Kings 12:25-33), as representational of the divine steeds. It is clear that E (like the Northern Hosea) is explicitly critical of this practice, and claims that the Yisraelites worshipped the calf as if it were the God.[/foot]</span> <span class="j"><sup>5</sup>&nbsp;When Aharon saw (this), he built a Mizbe'aḥ before it, and Aharon called out and said: "Tomorrow is a festival to YHVH!"[foot]J interprets the Calf as a representation of YHVH, and thus the Yisraelites sin was not one of belief in other gods – but of representing YHVH in concrete form (and compare J's Exodus 20:20). Note that Aharon is the vehicle of the Yisraelite sin, thus undermining his leadership – only YHVH leads the Yisraelites according to J.[/foot]</span> <span class="e"><sup>6</sup>&nbsp;They (started) early on the morrow, offered offerings-up and brought shalom-offerings; the people sat down to eat and drink and proceeded to revel.[foot]In the E version Moses' comes down the mountain right after receiving the tablets. Moses' intercession, and foreknowledge of Yisrael's sin is not apparent in E's 32:15-20, Moses only gets angry after he comes down the mountain and sees the calf.[/foot]</span>

Here, however, we follow the interpretation of Rabbi Joseph ben Isaac Bekhor Shor (12th cent., Orleans) who writes, <span class="hebrew" lang="he">לפי הפשט: לא תעזבנו עד שיגמור גידולו בחלב אמו, ”בישול“ משמע גמר, כמו ”הבשילו אשכלותיה ענבים.“ וכן בלשון תלמוד ”[ארץ ישראל] קלה לבשל פירותיה.“ והוא דומיא דרישא דקרא, ”ראשית בכורי אדמתך,“ משמע שמתבכרות, שלא תאחר עד גמר הפירות.</span> (According to the plain meaning, to not leave [the kid] until it is full grown from its mother’s milk. “Bishul” implies completion, as [in the verse (Gen. 40:10)]: “its clusters ripened (הבשילו) into grapes.” The Talmud uses the term similarly (b. Ketubot 112a): “[The land of Israel] grows its fruit with ease.” This makes it of a piece with the beginning of the verse “the choice first fruits of your soil [you shall bring].” This implies that they are going through the process of maturation, that one should not delay until the fruits are all ripe.) --ANV, after Rabbi Zev Farber in <a href="https://www.thetorah.com/article/prohibition-of-meat-and-milk-its-origins-in-the-text">thetorah.com</a>[/foot]"[foot]Note also J's great concern with seeing "YHVH" which is echoed in Chapter 19:20-25, and in J's additions to Chapter 24.<p />Since the tablets were the concrete manifestation of the covenant between Yisrael and the divine and they were shattered, a new set must be fashioned, and a new covenant wrought.<p />For this reason the final laws of the Book of the Covenant are reformulated by J this time with a more historically specific bent.<p />The laws of Passover are expanded in vss. 19-20 to include consecration of the first born (thus alluding to the plague of the first-born). Vs. 24 hints to one specific cultic center (alluding to centralization of cult in Jerusalem) which is to be visited by all males three times a year [vs. 24, and compare 15:17-18] as opposed to the more general formulation in Exodus 23:17. Also, the general law concerning "YHVH's sacrifice" of Exodus 23, is seen here as referring only to Passover.[/foot]</span>

The Masoretic text presented here is from Rabbi Dr. Seth (Avi) Kadish's <a href="https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/פרשת_כי_תשא/טעמים">Miqra al pi ha-Mesorah</a>. For the translation in English, I have adapted the translation of Everett Fox in the <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/series/DA5/the-schocken-bible">Schocken Bible</a> (1997), mostly to re-Hebraize divine names, place names, and personal names. As with the last parashot (Terumah and T'tsavveh), I have been careful to Hebraize the Mishkan and its main sacred objects. Instead of "soil" for 'Adamah,' I have used "fertile-ground." For verse 34:26, I follow the translation of Rabbi Joseph ben Isaac Bekhor Shor (12th cent., Orleans). (Please find the note on this verse below.) Aside from these, I have made minor punctuation changes. --Aharon N. Varady
