According to the poetry of the Midrash Tanḥuma, Bereshit 1:1, the words of the Torah were inscribed "black fire on white fire." For many years, I've wanted to look deeply into the black fire and visualize the full spectrum of the Torah's sources, hidden within the black fire but revealed through  a critical analysis of its layers of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redaction_criticism">redaction</a>. Below, I've set the text of the first Torah portion in the annual Torah reading cycle, using color-coding to distinguish the stratigraphic layers forming the composition of the Masoretic text according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplementary_hypothesis">Supplementary Hypothesis</a> presented by Tsemaḥ Yoreh in his <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=tpLIngEACAAJ">Kernel to Canon</a> series of books (2013-2017) and his website, <a href="http://www.biblecriticism.com/supplementary_index.html">the Sources of Biblical Narrative</a>. As Dr. Yoreh explains, 

<blockquote>The Supplementary Hypothesis asserts that the Pentateuch was composed by several different writers. This reflects an overwhelming academic consensus on Biblical authorship, even among scholars who do not subscribe to the Supplementary Hypothesis in particular.[....] According to the Supplementary Hypothesis, Biblical narrative is layered. No editor took a blowtorch to the parts of the Bible he disagreed with and destroyed them; if he had, we would not find these repetitions and contradictions. Instead, Biblical narrative began with a coherent, foundational bedrock, which over time accreted more and more storylines. Unlike geological processes, though, this process of addition was deliberate. What happened if one author disagreed with his predecessor’s storyline or worldview? He did not simply take an axe to the narrative; instead, he attempted to bury his predecessor’s point of view by repeating his own over and over again, thus skewing our understanding of the story in new ways. Every generation of readers sees the world differently, and thus every generation of writers seeks to adapt their predecessors’ cultural heritage to their own situation. We are not meant simply to dismiss earlier stories; rather, the intention of later writers is to transform our understanding of those stories via their additions.</blockquote>

<h3>Legend</h3>

<span class="e">&#11035; The kernel of biblical text upon which all other narratives were laid is thought to have been composed in the mid- to late eighth century BCE toward the end of the heyday of the northern Kingdom of Ephraim (one of the two kingdoms that occupied Biblical Israel). This layer, commonly referred to as 'E', is indicated with INDIGO text. The first parashah containing text of this layer was <a href="https://opensiddur.org/liturgical-readings/torah-readings/annual-cycle/sefer-bereshit/parashat-vayera/parashat-vayera-color-coded-according-to-its-narrative-layers/">parashat Vayera</a> in Sefer Bereshit. The last parashah containing text from E is Parashat Balaq in Sefer b'Midbar.</span>

<span class="j">&#11035; The next oldest layer is thought to have been composed in the late 8th or early 7th century BCE in the southern Kingdom of Judah. This layer, commonly known as 'J', is indicated with a BLUE text.</span>

<span class="p">&#11035; This strata, thought to have been composed during the exilic to early post-exilic period (571–486 BCE) is, as Dr. Yoreh explains, "responsible for supplementing the 'J' narrative with dates, names, and numbers, thus 'ordering' and authenticating 'J's account." This layer, commonly referred to as 'P' (for 'Priestly') appears here in GREEN text.</span>

<span class="h">&#11035; The next strata popularized Kohanite law for the remnant of Judah after the Temple was destroyed, and functioned as an intermediary between Kohanite lists and laws and the surrounding narrative. This layer, which Dr. Yoreh calls 'H' (for the 'Holiness Code') appears here in LIME-GREEN text.</span>

<span class="b">&#11035; The most recent layer of text, is a post-exilic (pre-3rd century BCE) text that Dr. Yoreh refers to as the "Bridger" which supplements earlier strata with genealogies and popular myths, providing narrative bridges between distant story cycles. This 'B' layer is presented here in FUCHSIA.</span>

The 'H' layer is absent from this parashah. 

Parashat Balaq (Numbers 22:2-25:9) in the annual Torah reading cycle is the seventh parashah in Sefer Bamidbar. It is preceded by parashat <a href="https://opensiddur.org/readings-and-sourcetexts/weekly-torah-readings/annual-cycle/sefer-bamidbar/parashat-huqat/parashat-huqat-color-coded-according-to-its-narrative-layers/">Ḥuqat</a> (Numbers 19:1-22:1). Parashat <a href="https://opensiddur.org/readings-and-sourcetexts/weekly-torah-readings/annual-cycle/sefer-bamidbar/parashat-pinhas/parashat-pinhas-color-coded-according-to-its-narrative-layers/">Pinḥas</a> (Numbers 25:10-30:1) follows it.

The Midianite animosity is found only in H (this source tells of a war against the Midianites [Numbers 31] following their implication in the sin of Baal Peor of Numbers 25), which is later than all the sources except for B. The non-priestly narrative style, however, eliminates H as the possible author and we are left with B, who as is his wont, bridges the narrative gap between the Balaam narratives and the sin of Baal Peor by indicating that the Midianites were implicated in both.

It is quite evident that these verses are additions to the narrative since its very unlikely that "Yhwh" the private Israelite God would allow Balaam to curse his nation. The supposition that Elohim, the more general deity, would allow Israel to be cursed is not as farfetched, and thus it is likely that the original layer of this narrative is Elohistic. (Note also the abrupt switches throughout chapter between "God" and "the Lord", indicating J additions to the E text, such as in vs. 8 and vs. 9).  [/foot]

<span class="b"><sup>31</sup>&nbsp;Then YHVH uncovered Bil'am's eyes and he saw YHVH's messenger stationed in the way, his sword drawn in his hand; he bowed and prostrated himself, to his brow. <sup>32</sup>&nbsp;YHVH's messenger said to him: "For what (cause) did you strike your jenny (on) these three occasions? Here, I came out as an adversary, for the way was rushed out against me. <sup>33</sup>&nbsp;Now the jenny saw me, so she turned aside before me (on) these three occasions.

And so Bil'am went with Balaq's nobles.</span>[foot]This episode is an anomaly within the Balaam cycle. It is the only section of Chapters 22-24 that depicts Balaam in a negative light. It portrays Balaam as cruel (He strikes his donkey), and disobedient, which doesn't fit in with vs. 21 in which God had consented that he go down to Moab. This negative description of Balaam in this episode accords with H's short notice of Balaam murder by the Israelites (Numbers 31:8), and is thus at least as late as this source. If we take into account the fairy-tale element of a talking donkey, it is quite likely that the author of this episode was the late Bridger, who frequently adds shards of extra-biblical myths to the fabric of the Pentateuch.

The Masoretic text presented here is from Rabbi Dr. Seth (Avi) Kadish's <a href="https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/פרשת_בלק/טעמים">Miqra al pi ha-Mesorah</a>. For the translation in English, I have adapted the translation of Everett Fox in the <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/series/DA5/the-schocken-bible">Schocken Bible</a> (1997), mostly to re-Hebraize divine names, place names, and personal names. Instead of "damn" and "damned," I have used cursed. Insted of "slaughter-site," I have used "place-for-slaughter." Instead of "she-ass" for a female donkey, I have used "jenny" which is the name for a female donkey in English. Instead of "king-of-beasts," I have "lioness." Aside from these, I have made minor punctuation changes.
