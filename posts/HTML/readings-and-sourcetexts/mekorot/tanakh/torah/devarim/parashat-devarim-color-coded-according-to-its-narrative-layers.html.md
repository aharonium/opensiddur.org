According to the poetry of the Midrash Tanḥuma, Bereshit 1:1, the words of the Torah were inscribed "black fire on white fire." For many years, I've wanted to look deeply into the black fire and visualize the full spectrum of the Torah's sources, hidden within the black fire but revealed through  a critical analysis of its layers of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redaction_criticism">redaction</a>. Below, I've set the text of the Torah portion in the annual Torah reading cycle, using color-coding to distinguish the stratigraphic layers forming the composition of the Masoretic text according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplementary_hypothesis">Supplementary Hypothesis</a> presented by Tsemaḥ Yoreh in his <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=tpLIngEACAAJ">Kernel to Canon</a> series of books (2013-2017) and his website, <a href="http://www.biblecriticism.com/supplementary_index.html">the Sources of Biblical Narrative</a>. As Dr. Yoreh explains, 

<blockquote>The Supplementary Hypothesis asserts that the Pentateuch was composed by several different writers. This reflects an overwhelming academic consensus on Biblical authorship, even among scholars who do not subscribe to the Supplementary Hypothesis in particular.[....] According to the Supplementary Hypothesis, Biblical narrative is layered. No editor took a blowtorch to the parts of the Bible he disagreed with and destroyed them; if he had, we would not find these repetitions and contradictions. Instead, Biblical narrative began with a coherent, foundational bedrock, which over time accreted more and more storylines. Unlike geological processes, though, this process of addition was deliberate. What happened if one author disagreed with his predecessor’s storyline or worldview? He did not simply take an axe to the narrative; instead, he attempted to bury his predecessor’s point of view by repeating his own over and over again, thus skewing our understanding of the story in new ways. Every generation of readers sees the world differently, and thus every generation of writers seeks to adapt their predecessors’ cultural heritage to their own situation. We are not meant simply to dismiss earlier stories; rather, the intention of later writers is to transform our understanding of those stories via their additions.</blockquote>

<h3>Legend</h3>

<span class="d1">&#11035; Most of the book of Deuteronomy (sefer Devarim) is considered the composite of three layers of redaction, 'D1,' 'D2,' and 'Dp.' Together, these layers (commonly referred to as the 'Deuteronomist') are thought to have formed by a complex process that reached probably from the 7th century BCE to the early 5th. This strata is primarily responsible for incorporating the law code of Deuteronomy into the Pentateuch. D1, as it is called, also adds a layer of redaction concerned with theodicy in the books of Joshua-Kings. D1 appears here in BLACK text.</span>

<span class="d2">&#11035; This strata, called D2, shares a particularly non-Judean perspective following the split between the north (Ephraim/Yisrael) and the south (Yehudah) after the reign of Shlomo haMelekh, a perspective that was ignored by D1 (and successive authors). In Deuteronomy, D2 adds hortatory (sermons) to D1's narrative introduction at the beginning of Deuteronomy (the focus of which is the observation of the commandments and divine justice), and otherwise supplements D1's work. (A few verses in Parashat Bo in the book of Exodus are also attributed to D2.) D2 appears here in RUST-BROWN text.</span>

<span class="dp">&#11035; This strata "reflects the strength and demands of the Jerusalem priesthood" following upon the reforms of King Yoshiyahu in the mid- to late 7th century BCE. The third Deuteronomist (and the latest) is the most easily identified, since they are the Deuteronomist most interested in Priestly themes such as purity, proper sacrifice, and the priests. This third Deuteronomist seems to have confined his additions to the book of Deuteronomy (almost exclusively confining himself to hortatory and laws). This layer, referred to as 'Dp' (for 'Priestly'), appears here in DARK GREEN text. Dp is absent from parashat Devarim.</span>

<span class="h">&#11035; The next strata popularized Kohanite law for the remnant of Judah after the Temple was destroyed, and functioned as an intermediary between Kohanite lists and laws and the surrounding narrative. This layer, which Dr. Yoreh calls 'H' (for the 'Holiness Code') appears here in LIME-GREEN text.</span>

<span class="b">&#11035; The most recent layer of text, is a post-exilic (pre-3rd century BCE) text that Dr. Yoreh refers to as the "Bridger" which supplements earlier strata with genealogies and popular myths, providing narrative bridges between distant story cycles. This 'B' layer is presented here in FUCHSIA.</span>

<span class="h">1 <sup>1</sup>&nbsp;These are the words that Mosheh spoke to all Yisra'el in (the country) across the Yarden</span>[foot]Many scholars believe that a late Priestly strand is extant within the book of Deuteronomy. In my opinion this strand is none other than H who harmonized between the Priestly and Deuteronomistic traditions, continuing Dtr 2's attempt to bring the book of Deuteronomy into line with the first four books of the Tetrateuch. This is one of three openings of the book. The original opening was likely vs. 6 (The Lord our God spoke to us at Horeb, saying, ‘You have stayed long enough at this mountain.), which marks these chapters as a historical prelude to the book of Deuteronomy. The second opening in vss. 1b-2, 5 (—in the wilderness, on the plain opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Di-zahab. 2By the way of Mount Seir it takes eleven days to reach Ḳadesh-barnea from Horeb, 5Beyond the Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses undertook to expound this law as follows) lists the places where Moses expounded the law, marking this as prelude to a legal work – it is quite clearly an addition since Deuteronomy does not launch into the law code until Chapter 12. Finally H, adds chronological information typical to the Priestly sources in vss. 3-4 (3In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses spoke to the Israelites just as the Lord had commanded him to speak to them. 4This was after he had defeated King Sihon of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, and King Og of Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei.). Vss. 3-4 are supplementary additions to vss. 1b-2, 5, which list the places where Moses expounded the law, since instead of adding to the summary of places, he gives us a precise date at the end of the journey.[/foot] <span class="d2">in the wilderness, in the plains near Suf, between Paran and Tofel, Lavan, Ḥatserot, and Di-zahav — <sup>2</sup>&nbsp;eleven days (it is) from Ḥorev,[foot]See the above comment, note the use of Horeb for Mount Sinai in vs.2 which is typical of the Deuteronomistic sources.[/foot] by the route of Mount Se'ir, (going) by Ḳadesh-barne'a.</span> <span class="h"><sup>3</sup>&nbsp;And it was in the fortieth year, in the eleventh New-moon, on (day) one after the New-moon, Mosheh spoke to the Children of Yisra'el according to all that YHVH had commanded him concerning them, <sup>4</sup>&nbsp;after he had struck Siḥon king of the Emori, who sat-as-ruler in Ḥeshbon, and Ōg king of Bashan, who sat-as-ruler in Ashtarot, in Edre'i.</span>[foot]See comment i. Note the idea of 40 desert years, which was innovated by P in Numbers 14 as a punishment for the rebellion of the spies.[/foot] <span class="d2"><sup>5</sup>&nbsp;In (the country) across the Yarden, in the land of Moav, Mosheh set about to explain this Torah/Instruction, saying:</span>[foot]According to Dtr 1, this is simply an account of the desert journey after Horeb as related by Moses, which doesn't agree with Dtr 2's opening which introduces this book as a body of laws expounded by Moses in various places.

According to Dtr 1, the conquest was straightforward, Sihon attacked Israel and Israel retaliated (vs. 32). Dtr 2, inserts a recapitulation of Numbers 21:21-25 (with important divergences): The Israelites (Moses in Deuteronomy) ask to pass through the land of Sihon, Sihon refuses and engages them in war. As with Pharaoh and the plagues the Lord hardens Sihon's heart which is not mentioned in Numbers, implying that the annihilation of Sihon is according to the divine plan, i.e. the extermination of the seven nations. ¶ Note the resumptive repetition of vs. 25 (25This day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you upon the peoples everywhere under heaven; when they hear report of you, they will tremble and be in anguish because of you.’) in vs. 31 (31 The Lord said to me, ‘See, I have begun to give Sihon and his land over to you. Begin now to take possession of his land.) implying that the intervening verses were indeed added by Dtr 2.[/foot]

The Masoretic text presented here is from Rabbi Dr. Seth (Avi) Kadish's <a href="https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/פרשת_דברים/טעמים">Miqra al pi ha-Mesorah</a>. For the translation in English, I have adapted the translation of Everett Fox in the <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/series/DA5/the-schocken-bible">Schocken Bible</a> (1997), mostly to re-Hebraize divine names, place names, and personal names. In place of "cattle" for <em>behemah</em>, I use "domesticated animal." Aside from these, I have made minor punctuation changes.
