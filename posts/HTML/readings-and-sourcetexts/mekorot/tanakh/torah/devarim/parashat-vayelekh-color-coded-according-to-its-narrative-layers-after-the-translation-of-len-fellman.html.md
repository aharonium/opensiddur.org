According to the poetry of the Midrash Tanḥuma, Bereshit 1:1, the words of the Torah were inscribed "black fire on white fire." For many years, I've wanted to look deeply into the black fire and visualize the full spectrum of the Torah's sources, hidden within the black fire but revealed through  a critical analysis of its layers of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redaction_criticism">redaction</a>. Below, I've set the text of the first Torah portion in the annual Torah reading cycle, using color-coding to distinguish the stratigraphic layers forming the composition of the Masoretic text according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplementary_hypothesis">Supplementary Hypothesis</a> presented by Tsemaḥ Yoreh in his <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=tpLIngEACAAJ">Kernel to Canon</a> series of books (2013-2017) and his website, <a href="http://www.biblecriticism.com/supplementary_index.html">the Sources of Biblical Narrative</a>. As Dr. Yoreh explains, 

<blockquote>The Supplementary Hypothesis asserts that the Pentateuch was composed by several different writers. This reflects an overwhelming academic consensus on Biblical authorship, even among scholars who do not subscribe to the Supplementary Hypothesis in particular.[....] According to the Supplementary Hypothesis, Biblical narrative is layered. No editor took a blowtorch to the parts of the Bible he disagreed with and destroyed them; if he had, we would not find these repetitions and contradictions. Instead, Biblical narrative began with a coherent, foundational bedrock, which over time accreted more and more storylines. Unlike geological processes, though, this process of addition was deliberate. What happened if one author disagreed with his predecessor’s storyline or worldview? He did not simply take an axe to the narrative; instead, he attempted to bury his predecessor’s point of view by repeating his own over and over again, thus skewing our understanding of the story in new ways. Every generation of readers sees the world differently, and thus every generation of writers seeks to adapt their predecessors’ cultural heritage to their own situation. We are not meant simply to dismiss earlier stories; rather, the intention of later writers is to transform our understanding of those stories via their additions.</blockquote>

<h3>Legend</h3>

Most of the book of Deuteronomy (sefer Devarim) is considered the composite of three layers of redaction, 'D1,' 'D2,' and 'Dp.' Together, these layers (commonly referred to as the 'Deuteronomist') are thought to have formed by a complex process that reached probably from the 7th century BCE to the early 5th.

<span class="d1">&#11035; This strata is primarily responsible for incorporating the law code of Deuteronomy into the Pentateuch. D1, as it is called, also adds a layer of redaction concerned with theodicy in the books of Joshua-Kings. D1 appears here in BLACK text.</span>

<span class="d2">&#11035; This strata, called D2, shares a particularly non-Judean perspective following the split between the north (Ephraim/Yisrael) and the south (Yehudah) after the reign of Shlomo haMelekh, a perspective that was ignored by D1 (and successive authors). In Deuteronomy, D2 adds hortatory (sermons) to D1's narrative introduction at the beginning of Deuteronomy (the focus of which is the observation of the commandments and divine justice), and otherwise supplements D1's work. (A few verses in Parashat Bo in the book of Exodus are also attributed to D2.) D2 appears here in RUST-BROWN text.</span>

<span class="j">&#11035; This strata is thought to have been composed in the late 8th or early 7th century BCE in the southern Kingdom of Judah. This layer, commonly known as 'J', is indicated with a BLUE text. This is the first appearance of J in sefer Devarim. The previous appearance of J in the Pentateuch occurs in parashat <a href="https://opensiddur.org/index.php?cat=3704">Balaq</a> in the book of Numbers.</span>

Parashat Vayelekh <span class="citation">(Deuteronomy 31:1-30)</span> in the annual Torah reading cycle is the ninth parashah in Sefer Devarim. It is preceded by parashat <a href="https://opensiddur.org/index.php?cat=3819">Nitsavim</a> <span class="citation">(Deuteronomy 29:9-30:20)</span>. Parashat <a href="https://opensiddur.org/index.php?cat=3824">Haazinu</a> <span class="citation">(Deuteronomy 32:1-52)</span>, follows it.

The Masoretic text presented here is from Rabbi Dr. Seth (Avi) Kadish's <a href="https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/פרשת_וילך/טעמים">Miqra al pi ha-Mesorah</a>. For the translation in English, I have adapted the translation of Len Fellman from his collection of transtropilized parashot, without including a number of innovations intended for readers listening to and/or chanting his text. (For Fellman's completely transtropilized text along with idiomatic "padded" text separated out as greyed text, please consult his source.) Fellman writes: 

<blockquote>I favor literal translations (e.g. “cut a covenant”) to call attention to Hebrew idioms, and towards simpler (even if less accurate) words (e.g. Ex. 12:7 “beam above the door” rather than “lintel”) to be easier to follow. If my readings provoke a discussion of the Hebrew, I consider that as justification for using less-than-idiomatic English. I try to find just the right balance between “literalness” and “listenable-ness”. A primary goal is throwing light on the Hebrew syntax....The English translations I mostly use (besides several scholarly commentaries) are the following:
<ul>
<li>Aryeh Kaplan, <em>The Living Torah</em> (1981) (also my source for proper names & transliterations)</li>
<li>Richard Elliott Friedman, <em>The Bible With Sources Revealed</em> (2003)</li>
<li>Everett Fox, <em>The Five Books of Moses</em> (1997)</li>
<li>The Stone Edition <em>Tanach</em> (1996)</li>
<li>JPS <em>Hebrew-English Tanach</em>, (2nd Ed. 2000), along with Orlinsky, ‘Notes on the New Translation of the Torah’ (1969)</li>
<li>Robert Alter, <em>The Five Books of Moses</em> (2004)</li>
<li>Commentaries in the <em>Anchor Bible</em> series</li>
<li>Rotherham, <em>The Emphasized Bible</em> (1902)</li>
<li><em>The Jerusalem Bible</em> (1966) (also my source for topic headings)</li>
<li><em>The New King James Bible</em> (1982)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

In my adaptation of Len's work, I mostly re-Hebraize divine names, place names, and personal names. I also use gender-neutral pronouns and circumlocutions in place of default Hebrew male pronouns and the terms 'God/gods' (e.g. singular 'they/their' and Hashem instead of 'he/him/his'). In place of "soil" for <em>adamah</em>, I prefer "fertile-earth" (as distinct from <em>arets</em> -- earth, which includes non-arable land). Aside from these, I have made minor punctuation changes. —Aharon Varady
