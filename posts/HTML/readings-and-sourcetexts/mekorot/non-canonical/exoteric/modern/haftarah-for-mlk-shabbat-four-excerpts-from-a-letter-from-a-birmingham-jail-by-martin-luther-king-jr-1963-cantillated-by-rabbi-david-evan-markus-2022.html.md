This is a haftarah comprised of excerpts from a "<a href="https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html">letter from a Birmingham jail</a>" by Martin Luther King Jr. (16 April 1963). The haftarah was cantillated by Rabbi David Evan Markus for a public reading on MLK Shabbat (the sabbath preceding MLK Day). In 2022 (5782), MLK Day coincided with Tu biShvat and this selection of excerpts references a popular association made during many seders for Tu biShvat between the four glasses of wine and the four seasons.[foot]That association dates to an insight offfered by Rabbi Arthur Waskow in his chapter on Tu biShvat in <em>Seasons of our Joy</em> (1981), p. 108: "These four [glasses of wine] may have represented the shift in the yearly seasons from the paleness of the winter through the awakening of the spring into the blooming summer and the riotous color of the fall."[/foot] Via their Facebook page, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/yourbayit/posts/4916712988351049">Bayit: Building Jewish</a> writes:

<blockquote>This year #tubishvat coincides with #MLKDay weekend. From that spiritual confluence comes this setting of excerpts from Letter from a Birmingham Jail, set to haftarah trope by Bayit board chair R. David Evan Markus. Following the four-part structure of the traditional seder in which we journey through the four seasons and the four worlds, these four excerpts are keyed to each of those four worlds. Here is a slide show of the four excerpts, a link to the four slides on google drive, and a downloadable PDF of the text marked-up for your own chanting: <a href="https://yourbayit.org/mlktub/">https://yourbayit.org/mlktub/</a> #whatrabbisdo #buildingJewish</blockquote>
