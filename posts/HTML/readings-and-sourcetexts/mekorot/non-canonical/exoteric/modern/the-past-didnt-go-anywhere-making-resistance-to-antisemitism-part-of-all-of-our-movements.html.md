and <strong>Cherie Brown</strong>, whose work to analyze anti-Jewish oppression was mentioned by so many interviewees as a source of inspiration and belief in themselves, whether they had worked with her closely, or seen one article by her long ago.

<h3>A few notes...</h3>
<strong>The word "Left"</strong> is used here to describe radical and progressive social justice movements and the individual activists who take up social justice struggles. You don't have to identify with this specific term -- it's a useful word here mainly because it's short.

<strong>The word "antisemitism"</strong> will be used here specifically to refer to oppression against Jews. (For background on why the term works this way, see p. 9.) <u>This definition should not be used to downplay the ongoing oppression against Arab people, who, like Jews, have been labeled Semites.</u> An alternative, more accurate term is <strong>"anti-Jewish oppression."</strong> It's useful for activists to gain experience with both terms.

I have chosen, where possible, not to show peoples' faces or use activists' and organizations' names. First, many perpetuate anti-Jewish behavior unintentionally; second, our goal should be not to shift blame to individuals, but to deal with the whole pattern. 

A <strong>glossary</strong> is located at the end of this pamphlet.

<h3>antisemitism is still a world problem</h3>
Sometimes people on the Left think the oppression of Jews stopped being a problem after the Holocaust. That's easy to think if what you know comes mostly from the U.S., where Jews have been unusually safe.

<strong>France, January 2006:</strong> Ilan Halimi, a 23 year-old Jew from a working-class suburb of Paris, was stalked and kidnapped by a gang that assumed, because he was Jewish, he would be rich. Halimi was then tortured to death over the course of three weeks. Residents from throughout the building joined in with the gang in a game-like atmosphere of torture. Halimi's mother warned French police of several recent kidnapping attempts on local Jews, but they told her to ignore the daily threats to kill her son, and the orders to collect ransom from synagogues. After Halimi's murder, the government resisted acknowledging it as an anti-Jewish killing.

The government had resisted investigating, and police and officials are a world problem widely suspected of permitting or aiding in the bombing. In July, the president admitted that officials had for ten years been actively destroying evidence from the case. To this day, every suspect has gone free. Not hard to imagine in a country where eleven years earlier, the military dictatorship that killed 30,000 people disproportionately targeted Jews for arrest and disappearance, and reserved special torture for Jewish prisoners.

<h3>In 2007, what is anti-Jewish oppression?</h3>
It's centuries of institutional anti-Jewish doctrines that get catalyzed in public when the mood hits. It's a perverse form of street cred: a political consensus that crosses boundaries, used by mainstream politicians and rebel forces alike who expose "the Jews" to prove they will speak truth to power. Even in the <strong>U.S.</strong>, where Jews have had 200 years of exceptional physical safety, it's a background hum: be it rumors placing Jews or Israelis behind 9/11, the hit film that restaged the "Passion plays" which sparked annual Easter massacres of Jews in medieval Europe, or theories arising amid growing public disenchantment with the Iraq war that it was fought for Jewish or Israeli interests.

The point is not that the sky is falling, or that the Holocaust is on its way back; in fact, several other oppressed groups are in more imminent danger as we speak.

<strong>Every oppression is also unique in some ways</strong>.

<blockquote><h3>(And what exactly <strong><u>are</u></strong> Jews, anyway?)</h3>

<strong>Jews are a globally-dispersed, multi-ethnic culture which is linked by a shared history of diaspora, and a religion (Judaism).</strong> Many Jews practice the religion; others are ethnic, <strong>secular (=non-religious)</strong> Jews.

Within the culture are many Jewish ethnic groups, such as: <strong>Mizrachim</strong> (communities of Jews who never left the Middle East after ancient Israel was destroyed by conquest, but settled in regions such as today's Iraq, Iran, Syria, etc.), <strong>Ashkenazim</strong> (whose ancestors made their way to Europe and founded communities there), <strong>Sephardim</strong> (whose ancestors formed communities in Spain and Portugal before being dispersed worldwide by the Inquisition), the <strong>Cochin Jews</strong> of India, <strong>Beta Israel</strong> of Ethiopia, <strong>Ibo Jews</strong> of Nigeria, <strong>and many more</strong>. <em>Within</em> each ethnicity lie plenty of differences as well.

Still other Jews share the religion but not the family lineage, and through conversion have become part of the Jewish people. Although orthodox religious law defines a Jew as one who has a Jewish mother or has had an orthodox conversion, many Jews reject this believing, for instance, that a person who has some Jewish ancestors and who identifies with and cares about the culture, is a Jew.

Due to how often in history Jewish communities have had to hide their identities to escape persecution, there are also millions of people globally with unrecognized Jewish ancestry. In recent years, relative safety for Jews has allowed more open conversation about Jewish origins, and a growing number of communities are "coming out" as Jews.</blockquote>

<h3>A term we didn't freely choose:</h3>
<strong>"Antisemitism" was a word popularized in 1879 by someone who was neither Arab nor Jewish</strong>, Wilhelm Marr. From the beginning <strong>it was chosen as a chic, new scientific word</strong> to show that Jews were an inferior race (not a religion that they could convert out of), and to replace the word Jew-hatred (Judenhass) so that Jew-haters could enjoy sounding more sophisticated.

Marr and his colleagues used the term antisemites for themselves as something to be proud of. They built an organization to advocate discrimination against Jews, the Antisemites' League. When Marr and his movement designed this term to degrade a whole people, they couldn't care less that they were using it inaccurately by designating it for Jews specifically.

<strong>Although Jews didn't get to choose the term for their oppression</strong> - and oppressed groups rarely do -<strong> over years being attacked by it, they have accepted the term</strong> to describe the historical experience of being targeted for being Jews.

There isn't really one oppression that targets all those who were labeled "Semites" in a similar way.[foot]The term 'Semite" was itself an invention of European Orientalists, imposed on Jews and Arabs. [/foot] But there is a larger oppression that both groups experience: <strong>Orientalism</strong>. From the Chinese Exclusion Act and the Third Reich to the Red Scare and the War on Terror, <strong>the "West" has historically targeted Asians, Arabs and Jews</strong> as mysterious, dishonestly and manipulatively intelligent, overly sensual, warlike, and barbarically loyal to their 'tribe' instead of to humankind.</blockquote>

<strong><u>Partly it's that it allows Jews success.</u></strong> Many oppressions rely on keeping a targeted group of people poor, uneducated, designated non-white, or otherwise 'at the bottom.' Anti-Jewish oppression doesn't depend on that. Although at many times it has kept Jews in poverty or designated non-white, these have been "optional" features. <strong>Because the point of anti-Jewish oppression is to keep a Jewish face in front</strong>, so that Jews, instead of ruling classes, become the target for peoples' rage, <strong>it works even more smoothly</strong> when Jews are allowed some success, and can be perceived as the ones "in charge" by other oppressed groups.

Internalized oppression affects all oppressed groups. The form it takes depends on each group's history. <strong>For instance, on an individual level,</strong> Jewish people - especially men - often perceive themselves as physically weak. We were legally banned from being allowed to carry weapons for substantial periods under Christian and Muslim rule. European society excluded us from mainstream professions (farming, etc.) that strengthened the body. We were literally unable to protect ourselves and our families from mass violence and rape. Jewish people - especially women - often feel disgust about ourselves and our bodies, because, as the main racial 'Other' in Europe, European society and popular culture created its images of what was ugly and disgusting based on our Jewish faces, and its fantasies of what our bodies looked like.

<blockquote>
<h3>The "Useful" Jew</h3>
For centuries, Jewish communities could be expelled from European towns at any time, for any reason and made homeless. Permission to stay lasted only as long as an area's rulers saw local Jews as 'useful.' Ruling classes developed and passed down strategies to make good use of Jews' vulnerability. Today, it's important for us to look for the ways these strategies are still being used.

<strong>the "middleman"</strong> - Rulers used Jews for "middlemen" jobs that put Jews in direct contact with the exploited, disgruntled peasantry, shielding rulers from the backlash for their unjust policies. A peasant might live a lifetime without seeing the nobleman who decided her fate; it was Jews were the face of power at her door collecting taxes and rent, Jews who seemed in control, and Jews who faced the violence when peasants in poverty decided to resist.

<strong>the buffer zone</strong> - Since Jews needed special permission to live in European areas, many rulers took advantage of them by settling them in the areas most vulnerable to military attack, or where restless subjects were likely to rebel. For the privilege of a home, Jews had to accept their role as the population that could be sacrificed.

<strong>the Court Jew</strong> - History is full of unpopular kings who managed to save their asses by turning the crowds against a trusty (but disposable) Court Jew. As a king's agent, a Court Jew might gain great personal privilege, even some power. But when problems arose, rulers counted on being able to divert mass blame and violence to the Court Jew.

<strong>the "pressure valve"</strong> - Only a few might be tax collectors or Court Jew. But all of an area's Jews were a ruler's handy target: When the economy or other conditions became unbearable, Jewish homes provided a whole neighborhood where gentile masses could riot and let off steam.</blockquote>

<blockquote>If you liked COINTELPRO, you'll love the Protocols of the Elders of Zion.

<strong>Remember COINTELPRO, the US government's covert campaign to wipe out the most promising movements of the '50s, '60s and '70s?</strong> It used strategic rumors, forged letters and other tactics to successfully divide and destroy vital parts of the Black Power movement, the American Indian Movement, and others.

<strong>The Protocols of the Elders of Zion was the same thing, 60 years before.</strong> A forged text claiming to be minutes from a secret meeting of powerful Jews, it was circulated by officers of Russia's Czarist secret police, who were worried about the growing revolutionary movement in Russia. Knowing how much of the movement's grassroots momentum was coming from Jews, and knowing how easily they could divide the masses if they kindled already-existing antisemitism, police agents plagiarized another author's work of fiction and rewrote it as the imaginary proceedings of a secret Jewish planning meeting for world domination. The Protocols, in distribution since around 1903, describe their plan to take over the world through communism, capitalism, immorality - all possible angles. <strong>In fact, it's from this document that the modern version of the myth of Jewish world domination got its start.</strong>

Experienced activists will caution you not to assume COINTELPRO's tactics ever ended. Well, you needn't even wonder about the Protocols. They are being put to use around the world: in some countries taught as state-sanctioned truth, but sold worldwide, and bought by record numbers of people. But <strong>the gravest insult to activists is that this fraud</strong>, created with the specific intent to destroy activists and movements like ourselves, <strong>is parroted</strong> by some of our very own colleagues, in our own spaces.</blockquote>

Ever since Israel won the '67 war, and suddenly looked to the U.S. like a handy little friend in the Middle East, the Right has put on a new costume: Defenders of Israel and the Jews.

<strong>It would be, shall we say, an understatement</strong> to note that in the vast sweep of history, Jewish liberation has not exactly been a pet cause of the Right. So why have they gotten away with making fighting antisemitism into a noble Right-wing issue?

<strong>Because the Left hasn't taken anti-Jewish oppression on.</strong> Whenever the Left is quiet about an issue that matters to people, it leaves a vacuum for the Right to walk into. They use it to their advantage, to draw in people worried about that issue, and as moral ammunition for their crusades.

It was a bargain no self-respecting liberation movement today would touch - and the only offer Jews had. Jews kept working to assimilate for the next 150 years, as chances at integration slipped in and out of their hands. At at the same time, they sought freedom by other means: through consistently high involvement in movements for reform and revolution. From Salonica to Moscow, Baghdad, Buenos Aires and New York, Jews helped form the base of revolutionary movements. There, they were allowed to succeed and welcomed into leadership as had never occurred in jobs and universities - but it was assumed they had to transcend their petty Jewish roots. In radical circles, as among their liberal emancipators, Jews were told that their Jewish identities should be a remnant of the past.

It's absolutely possible to critique Israel without being antisemitic - but it's not automatic. You keep things clear when you <strong>describe accurately and specifically what you oppose, and critique <u>actions and policy</u> as unjust -- <u>not people or nations</u> as evil.</strong> And when people suggest that they see targeting of Jews in something you're saying or doing, don't shoot them down; seek out useful information in what they're saying that might help you give your message even more clarity and impact.

<strong>First, it backfires because major, organized antisemitic movements also use the term, for the opposite purpose:</strong> to spread anti-Jewish ideology without looking so bad. That's why 2005's international conference, "Zionism As the Biggest Threat to Modern Civilization" was co-chaired by neo-nazi politician David Duke. For many antisemitic groups, "Zionists" are the demonic Jews controlling the world, Protocol-style; and "Zionism" is the general body of evildoing by Jews. Because we activists are only suspicious of Jew-bashing, not attacks on "Zionists," their antisemitic imagery makes its way right into our circles. Second, because it <strong>replaces one one-dimensional image of a 'bad guy' with another.</strong> It bypasses the actual work of avoiding anti-Jewish oppression: reshaping how we think and talk about Jews and Israelis to see them as 3-dimensional human beings, capable of wrongdoing like any others. <strong>Finally,</strong> using the term "Zionists" <strong>doesn't protect Jews.</strong> It just makes people who bomb Jewish schools, synagogues, etc., call the people they're killing Zionists.

<strong>Principled anti-Zionism has little to do</strong> with the fake "Zionism" that antisemites like Duke attack. There are many rational reasons why some people are opposed to the philosophy that there should be a Jewish state, just as lots of rational reasons motivate others to believe a Jewish state is neccessary.[foot]For instance: An anti-Zionist might rationally oppose Zionists' having consciously established a state where they did, knowing that this would lead to dispossessing the Palestinian people. A Zionist might observe that Jews' vulnerability was linked to being a permanently small minority and support Jews having one place where they are the governing majority.[/foot]

<strong>Zionism is not an insult.</strong> It's not <strong>a catch phrase, a code word for racism or imperialism,</strong> or the name for unpleasant things done by Jews. <strong>It's a nationalism,</strong> and, as often happens with nationalisms, it has not fully liberated its people and has oppressed others in the process. It stands for a huge range of beliefs and believers: from the Right-wing racist who wants to 'transfer' (forcibly expel) all Palestinians, to the person who wants Jews to have a self-determined state in the only land to which Jewish diaspora ethnicities around the world have shared a cultural tie, to the person who wants to keep living as a Jew in the "Land of Israel" but is open to living in a binational, Palestinian-Jewish state.

Being angry at or critical of the actions of a country is different from buying into racist mythologies about a people. <strong>If there are people who believe not only that Israel acts unjustly, but that Jews control the world or that the Holocaust never happened, there are deeper anti-Jewish influences at work.</strong> Israel doesn't indoctrinate people in Kiev, Denver or Paris to think that Jews are all rich, in league with the devil, or that they bake with children's blood. Israel doesn't make New York, Damascus and Mexico City vendors sell the Protocols, or fund local movie industries to televise them. It doesn't make Americans (activists included) so unaware of the world beyond our borders that we believe Israel is the only country committing the violations it has. It doesn't need to; because long before Israel or Zionism existed, the targeting of Jews was well entrenched in these lands.

<strong>One problematic way this occurs on the Left is when activists teach that things for Jews in Arab lands were fine until Israel came along. Jews <em>did</em> live in greater harmony in Arab lands</strong> than in Europe. <strong>But as religious minorities, they also experienced oppression</strong> which could range from mild, routine degradation to violent mob attacks. This legacy was compounded by colonizing regimes, who brought European antisemitic theories into the region.

<h4>Why do many Jews fight so hard against the Right to Return?</h4>
(See p. 23.)

<strong>The fact that many Jews fiercely oppose the Palestinian Right to Return,</strong> and the related vision of a peaceful bi-national state, <strong>befuddles many activists, who see</strong> a shared democracy where both Jews and Palestinians receive respect as <strong>one of the most hopeful and just solutions imaginable.</strong> But, along with Israel's denials of its responsibility for the refugee crisis, there is a second, and deeper issue involved: Jews have had convincing experiences that <strong>lacking a place to run to can have life-or-death consequences.</strong>

<strong>In 1938, 32 nations met</strong> in Evian-les-Bains, France <strong>to discuss whether to allow European Jews,</strong> desperate to flee the Nazis, <strong>into their countries. 31 of them</strong> - all but the Dominican Republic - <strong>refused.</strong> Evian was an awful culmination of centuries of Jews' attempts to flee forced conversion, violence and expulsion; to which Jews were vulnerable, partly because as a small diaspora they were <strong>minorities in every place</strong>, at the mercy of elites. Many fear that if Palestinians achieve Return inside Israel's 1948 borders, win true democratic rights and grow to be a majority, it might end Jewish control over immigration to Israel, which many see as their safeguard in case of an anti-Jewish resurgence.

No matter how frightening a physical implementation of Return may sound, Jews must take the fundamental step to acknowledge Palestinians' human Right to Return.</blockquote>

The idea that Jews control the government or the world began with traditional Church authorities passing down images of Jews as a group in league with the Devil, with special powers from the Devil that gave them evil control over earthly events. Christian rulers furthered the myth that Jews were in control, by sticking Jews in the 'face of power' roles with which everyday peasants interacted (ie, tax collectors).

Jews were the default "outsider" group in so many societies; always handy to target when things went wrong. What's more, Jews were treated so badly in many of these societies, it was usually easy for people to imagine that the Jews wished another country would take over and change their conditions.

For centuries in Christian empires, Jews were not legally permitted in mainstream professions. They often survived by working at trades forbidden to, or considered 'beneath' Christians - like professional acting, or collecting taxes or rent. One such job was moneylending. Although some Jews were moneylenders and benefited from economic privilege, most remained poor, and the classic dynamic of anti-Jewish oppression went on: Jews who got to work did so at the price of everyday exposure to the violence and anger of poor peasants in debt; rulers got to use them as scapegoats in times of economic instability. The attacks that got channeled toward Jews were absorbed by the few money-lenders and the poverty-stricken majority alike.
