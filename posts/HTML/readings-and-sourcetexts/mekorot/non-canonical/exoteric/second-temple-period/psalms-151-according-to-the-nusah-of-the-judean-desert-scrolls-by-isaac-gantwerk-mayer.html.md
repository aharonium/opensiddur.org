Psalms 151 through 155 are not found in the Masoretic Text books of Psalms, or in rabbinic writings. A <a href="https://opensiddur.org/readings-and-sourcetexts/mekorot/non-canonical/exoteric/second-temple-period/psalms-151-as-found-in-the-septuagint-lxx/">Psalms 151</a> was recorded in the Septuagint, whereas Psalms 152—155 were only found in some Syriac (or Christian Aramaic) Peshiṭṭa texts. For a long time, it was assumed that they were Greek compositions, either by Hellenized Jews or not by Jews at all. That all changed with the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, specifically 11Q5, also known as the Great Psalms Scroll. This scroll not only included text from thirty-two psalms (in a non-standard order), but also passages from Apocryphal Psalms 154, 155, and 151, as well as sections of Ben Sira and several otherwise unknown psalmodic compositions. Here the editor has taken the Hebrew text from the Great Psalms Scroll, supplemented with Peshiṭṭa content for the worn passages, and attempted to create masoretic-style vocalization and cantillation for these three fascinating pieces of Hebrew apocrypha, along with a new English translation.

Psalm 151a is unlike any other psalm, because it is openly and clearly a description of David's own life. He describes his childhood as the youngest of the family, and his anointing. It may have not been included as part of the Masoretic canon because this dissimilarity leads to just a whiff of pseudepigraphical overcompensation. [The psalm is designated Psalms 151a to destinguish it from the text of <a href="https://opensiddur.org/readings-and-sourcetexts/mekorot/non-canonical/exoteric/second-temple-period/psalms-151-as-found-in-the-septuagint-lxx/">Psalms 151</a> found in the Septuagint. --ANV]

My hands worked the pipe, 
my fingers the lute;
so I could place honor for YHWH.
I said to myself:
“The mountains cannot testify of Him,
nor can the hills tell of Him,
nor the trees His way,
nor the flock His acts.
For who could tell, and who could say,
and who could recount His acts?”
