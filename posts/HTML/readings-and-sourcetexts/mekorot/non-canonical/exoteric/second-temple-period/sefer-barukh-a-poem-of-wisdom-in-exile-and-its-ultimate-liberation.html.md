The book of Barukh (also, Βαροὺχ and Baruch/Barouch) is a deuterocanonical work traditionally attributed to Barukh son of Neriyah, the scribe of the prophet Jeremiah. Preserved in the Seputagint, the text is one of a good number of Jewish works from Antiquity either written in Greek or whose Aramaic and Hebrew source was lost. While the opening portions of Barukh (1:1-3:8) show quintessential signs of having been translated from Hebrew, this poetic section is of uncertain origin and a Vorlage cannot be constructed for it with the same level of accuracy. (<a href="/?p=32891">Visit here</a> for the reconstructed Hebrew Vorlage of Baruch 1:1-3:8 by Emmanuel Tov, vocalized and cantillated by Isaac Gantwerk Mayer.)

<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Put on the double-cloth[foot]or double-cloak, a style of garment. Perhaps this is a reference to the dress of the Kohen Gadol (high priest).

The English translation here was adapted by Aharon Varady from the critical translation of Joseph Ziegler (<em>Septuaginta: Vetus Testamentum Graecum Auctoritate Societatis Litterarum Gottingensis editum XV: leremias Baruch Threni Epistula leremiae</em> [Göttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1957]). I have re-Hebraized divine names, translating θεὸς/θεοῦ as YHVH, as Emmanuel Tov had in the earlier section of Barukh, except where it was reasonable to assume a different divine name. I have left αἰωνίου as "Everlasting' as I was uncertain whether this was a translation of a divine name or epithet. --Aharon Varady
