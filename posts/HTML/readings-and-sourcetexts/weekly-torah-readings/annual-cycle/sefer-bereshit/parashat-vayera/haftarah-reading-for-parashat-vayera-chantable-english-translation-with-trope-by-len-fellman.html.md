This is an English translation of the Haftarah readings for Parashat Vayera (II Kings 4:1-37), transtropilized. (Transtropilation is the term coined by Len Fellman to describe the process of translating from cantillated Hebrew, as closely as possible, “word for word and <em>trōp</em> for <em>trōp</em>”, with the main purpose being to aid a person with minimal Hebrew training in following the Hebrew leyning word for word.) This translation is based on Aryeh Kaplan's ‘The Living Torah’, the Stone Edition Tanakh, the Plaut Ḥumash, the Jersualem Bible, and the JPS 1917.
