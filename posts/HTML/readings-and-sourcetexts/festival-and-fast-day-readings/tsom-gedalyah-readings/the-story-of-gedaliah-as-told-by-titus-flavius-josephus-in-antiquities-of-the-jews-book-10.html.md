Then, after making these nations subject to him, he invaded Egypt in order to subdue it, and, having killed the king who was then reigning and appointed another, he again took captive the Jews who were in the country and carried them to Babylon.[foot]According to Scripture it was Nebuzaradan who carried off the last group of captives in the 23rd year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign. Josephus's statement about the conquest of the Moabites and Ammonites is based on the prophecies of Yirmiyahu, cc. 44-49.

And so, as we have learned from history, the Hebrew race twice came to such a pass as to go beyond the Euphrates.

Now, when Shalmaneser removed the Israelites, he settled in their place the nation of Chuthaeans, who had formerly lived in the interior of Persia and Media and who were then, moreover, called Samaritans because they assumed the name of the country in which they were settled. But the king of Babylonia, when he carried off the two tribes, did not settle any nation in their place, and for this reason all of Judaea and Jerusalem and the temple remained deserted for seventy years.

Now the entire interval of time from the captivity of the Israelites until the deportation of the two tribes amounted to one hundred and thirty years, six months and ten days.[foot]Whether we reckon the lower limit of this interval as the deportation in the 11th year of Zedekiah's reign (§135) or that which took place 5 years later (§181) the chronology is inconsistent with that implied earlier (cf. §143 note b). According to Antiquities 9:278 the Israelite deportation took place in the 7th year of Hezekiah. The sum of regnal years for the rest of Hezekiah's reign and those of his successors is 132 years 6 months 20 days. There is thus a discrepancy of about 2 years (or 7 years if we take the last deportation, mentioned in §181, as the lower limit). For various theories as to the source of Josephus's chronology here see Weill's note ad loc. (which is not very helpful). It may be added that according to modern reckoning the interval between the two great deportations is about 135 years (722/1-587/6 B.C.E.).[/foot]
