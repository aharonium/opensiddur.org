While many religions maintain a stolid and serious demeanor, there is a day on the Jewish calendar that officially promotes ribald humor, drunkenness, and mockery. No aspect of faith, character, text, or practice is too sacred for Purim satire, even the Divine One. Purim is certainly a time for child play, for costumes, feasting, and revelry. It is also a sublime occasion for adult discovery, for unmasking our deep selves and our culture. Esther—whose name alludes to the hidden—is the Queen of the scroll we read on Purim, Megillat Esther. Her unfurling journey from privacy and secrecy to public sovereignty reveals and derides machinations of our lives and the institutions of power. Esther proposes an obvious solution to deeply flawed practices at the highest echelons of power that compromise human life and wellbeing, then and now.

The sages ordained the celebration of Purim every year to commemorate events described in Megillat Esther, a later inclusion among the “Writings” in the Tanakh. Megillat Esther is very unusual. It and the Song of Songs are the only biblical books that do not expressly mention the Divine. Esther, whose name conceals hiddenness, is a young unknown woman, the child of refugees who were exiled from home in Jerusalem by the Babylonian conquest. Rising to sovereignty, her character might reveal radically subversive divine intentions.

Megillat Esther tells of the deliverance of Jews from a threat of annihilation during the reign of Aḥashverosh over the massive Persian empire of 127 states. Some interpret Aḥashverosh to be an historical figure, Xerxes I who ruled from 486–465 BCE, while the later Septuagint and the ancient historian Josephus identify him as Artaxerxes (465 to 424 BCE, see <a href="http://www.ccel.org/j/josephus/works/ant-11.htm">Jewish Antiquities 11, chapter 6</a>). Despite its accurate portrayal of the Persian court of its day, historians consider the scroll to be fictional, a novella (see Adele Berlin, “The Book of Esther and Ancient Storytelling,” Journal of Biblical Literature 120. no. 1, Spring 2001: 3–14). The carefully developed drama, symbolism, sublime inversions, character portrayal, and hyperbole convey a finely constructed literary work.

While thoughtful readers might find irony and mockery in many sites in the Tanakh, Megillat Esther excels at them. Dark and deadly mortal threat coexists with bumbling political-sexual- ethnic-economic intrigue complete with set, costume design and changes, extravagant drinking and feasting, mounting suspense, and melodramatic monologues.

Summoned to appear at King Aḥashverosh's six-month long banquet with his court and dignitaries, Queen Vashti refuses. In the wake of Vashti's insubordination, the court crushes a potential women's uprising with an edict that all women must submit themselves to the male authority of their household. All attractive young women are gathered to the capital city Shushan as candidates to replace the banished queen Vashti. Esther, also known as Hadassa, a Jewish orphan under the care of her cousin Mordekhai, wins the king's favor and becomes queen. At Mordekhai's request, Esther hides her Jewish identity.

At this point, we would expect the story to end with the annulment of the genocidal decree against the Jews following Esther's request. However, according to the laws of the land, once a king's edict has been issued, it cannot be cancelled.

Haman's racism follows imminently upon the heels of the king's sexism. Indeed, the root of Haman's wrath against Mordekhai and the Jews parallels the king's fury against Vashti and the women.

Disdain for and subordination of women are pre-conditions for the progression toward violent evils that threaten to prevail under the jester-king.

Insurgent against her backdrop, Esther reveals the problem and the solution. Esther manifests the hidden divine force from which she derives her name. Esther's indomitable commitment to creation, to life and humanity is reflected in her appeal to recall the edicts of violence.

At the point that Esther reveals her own identity and the plot against her people, she also lays bare the fundamental error in the structure of sovereignty and power. The king has no power to revoke his own seal.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For the writing which is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, may no man reverse. (8:8)</p>
The structure of authority is supreme. The man ruling over the entire empire is subordinate to an even more powerful order than himself—his obligation to serve and abide by the institution that establishes his position. Undermining the authority of the system would undermine his role in it, the justification for his power. As the one who benefits maximally from the system that enthrones his sovereignty, the king is most invested in perpetuating the illusion of its integrity. All those who derive their status, authority, and wealth from a power structure are similarly motivated to perpetuate it. <em>Everything</em> takes lesser significance than the system, even life itself.

This pattern of immutable male power has and continues to dominate human society.

With her rise to sovereignty, and exercising her straightforward moral passion, Queen Esther unmasks the mis-placed priority that dominates most of human social-political organization—perpetuating power and the continuity of institutions at the cost of human life and flourishing. Through mockery and critique, Megillat Esther and the celebration of Purim offer an amazing opportunity to reveal the dark and deadly outcomes of dominantly male institutions of power that to a very large extent affect the daily life and fate of most of humanity.

Many critique the brutality of the Megilla. After murdering tens of thousands of Persians, Jews sit down to celebrate and feast. The critique relies on interpreting the text at a simple level, as a straightforward or pseudo-historical account. In this unit, we probe the reflexive irony of the Megilla as a fictional text that exposes and mocks excesses and brutality of dominantly male institutional power. Different approaches to the text yield very different attitudes about Purim, and Judaism.
