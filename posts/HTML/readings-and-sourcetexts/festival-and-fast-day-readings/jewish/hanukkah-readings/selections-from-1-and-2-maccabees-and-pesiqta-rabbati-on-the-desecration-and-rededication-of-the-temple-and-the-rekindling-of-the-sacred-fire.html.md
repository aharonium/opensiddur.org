The following are selections from 1 Maccabees, 2 Maccabees, and Pesiqta Rabbati which inform the story of Ḥanukkah: the desecration and re-dedication of the Temple (especially as it relates to Sukkot and the Greco-Roman Brumalia), divine intervention in the Maccabean Revolt, and the Rekindling of the Sacred Fire. The selections are organized according to these four themes (and not according to the order of the source materials appearance in the works in which they appear).

Desecration & Rededication: According to 1 Maccabees (1:59, 4:52-54), the 25th day of Kislev was significant as the day upon which the Temple altar was desecrated, and thus the date chosen for the altar's resanctification. 2 Maccabees 6:7 describes part of a series of defilements including the Temple’s consecration to Zeus and a festival to Bacchus. The 25th of Kislev in the early Jewish calendar may have coincided with the winter solstice and the climax of the Saturnalia in the Roman calendar. The winter solstice concluded the month-long Greek/Roman festival of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brumalia">Brumalia</a> celebrating Saturn/Cronus, Ceres/Demeter, and Bacchus. (The name of the festival is derived from the Latin <em>bruma</em>, meaning  “shortest day.”) The festival was known for its wine mixing and revelry. The ceremonial procession of revelers carrying ivy during the Brumalia (2 Maccabees 6:7) compares with the description of celebrants parading with <em>lulavim</em> during the celebration of the first Ḥanukkah in 2 Maccabees 10:6-7. According to 2 Maccabees 10:5-8, Ḥanukkah was celebrated for eight days in order to reprise the eight day festival of Sukkot that was missed due to the Seleucid occupation of Jerusalem and the desecration of the Temple.  

Divine Intervention: In 1 Enoch's <a href="https://opensiddur.org/readings-and-sourcetexts/festival-and-fast-day-readings/jewish/hanukkah-readings/the-animal-apocalypse-with-aramaic-fragments-and-translations-in-geez-and-english/">Animal Apocalypse</a> (chapter 90:13-18), in <a href="https://opensiddur.org/readings-and-sourcetexts/festival-and-fast-day-readings/jewish/hanukkah-readings/midrash-maaseh-hanukkah-bet-retelling-of-megillat-antiokhus-as-midrash-aggadah/">Midrash Maaseh Ḥanukkah "bet"</a> and also the <a href="https://opensiddur.org/readings-and-sourcetexts/festival-and-fast-day-readings/jewish/hanukkah-readings/megillat-antiokhus-ladino-rabbi-isaac-magriso-meam-loez-bamdibar-behaalothekha-constantinople-1764/">Ladino variation of the Midrash</a> told by Rabbi Isaac Magriso in the Me'am Loez, an expansion of the story of the final battle of the Macabees is told in which there are angelic warriors doing battle for Yisrael. Such fantastic elements of the Maccabean struggle can be found in 2 Maccabees 10:24-31 and 11:1-12.

Rekindling: With 2 Maccabees 1:18-22, 2 Maccabees 10:1-9, and Pesiqta Rabbati §2, we have two stories which combined may have served as the source for the now familiar miracle of Ḥanukkah as it appears at the end of <a href="https://opensiddur.org/readings-and-sourcetexts/festival-and-fast-day-readings/jewish/hanukkah-readings/megillat-antiokhus-critical-text-prepared-by-menahem-tsvi-kaddari-translated-by-john-reeves/">Megillat Antiokhus</a> and in the Talmud Bavli Shabbat 21b.

<strong>1 Maccabees 4</strong> <sup>36</sup>&nbsp;Then Yehudah and his brothers said, “See, our enemies are crushed; let us go up to cleanse the sanctuary and dedicate it.” <sup>37</sup>&nbsp;So all the army assembled and went up to Har Tsiyyon. <sup>38</sup>&nbsp;There they saw the sanctuary desolate, the Mizbe'aḥ profaned, and the gates burned. In the courts they saw bushes sprung up as in a thicket, or as on one of the mountains. They saw also the chambers of the kohanim in ruins. <sup>39</sup>&nbsp;Then they tore their clothes and mourned with great lamentation; they sprinkled themselves with ashes <sup>40</sup>&nbsp;and fell face down on the ground.

<strong>2 Maccabees 1</strong> <sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Since on the twenty-fifth day of Kislev we shall celebrate the purification of the temple, we thought it necessary to notify you, in order that you also may celebrate the festival of Sukkot and the festival of the fire given when Neḥemyah, who built the Temple and the Mizbe'aḥ, offered sacrifices. <sup>19</sup>&nbsp;For when our ancestors were being led captive to Persia, the pious kohanim of that time took some of the fire of the Mizbe'aḥ[foot]Probably <em>esh hatamid</em>.[/foot] and secretly hid it in the hollow of a dry cistern, where they took such precautions that the place was unknown to anyone. <sup>20</sup>&nbsp;But after many years had passed, when it pleased God, Neḥemyah, having been commissioned by the king of Persia, sent the descendants of the kohanim who had hidden the fire to get it. And when they reported to us that they had not found fire but only a thick liquid, he ordered them to dip it out and bring it. <sup>21</sup>&nbsp;When the materials for the sacrifices were presented, Neḥemyah ordered the kohanim to sprinkle the liquid on the wood and on the things laid upon it. <sup>22</sup>&nbsp;When this had been done and some time had passed, and when the sun, which had been clouded over, shone out, a great fire blazed up, so that all marveled.[foot]Dr. Yael Avrahami <a href="https://www.thetorah.com/article/identifying-the-building-blocks-of-chanukah">notes</a>, "The association between this new Sukkot of Kislev and fire may shed light on Josephus’ name for Chanukah, “Lights” (Antiquities 12:7.7).

<strong>2 Maccabees 10</strong> <sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Now Maccabeus and his followers, YHVH leading them on, recovered the temple and the city; <sup>2</sup>&nbsp;they tore down the altars that had been built in the public square by the foreigners, and also destroyed the sacred precincts. <sup>3</sup>&nbsp;They purified the sanctuary, and made another altar of sacrifice; then, striking fire out of flint, they offered sacrifices, after a lapse of two years, and they offered incense and lighted lamps and set out the bread of the Presence. <sup>4</sup>&nbsp;When they had done this, they fell prostrate and implored YHVH that they might never again fall into such misfortunes, but that, if they should ever sin, they might be disciplined by him with forbearance and not be handed over to blasphemous and barbarous nations. <sup>5</sup>&nbsp;It happened that on the same day on which the sanctuary had been profaned by the foreigners, the purification of the sanctuary took place, that is, on the twenty-fifth day of the same month, which was Kislev. <sup>6</sup>&nbsp;They celebrated it for eight days with rejoicing, in the manner of the festival of Sukkot, remembering how not long before, during the festival of Sukkot, they had been wandering in the mountains and caves like wild animals. <sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Therefore, carrying ivy-wreathed wands and beautiful branches and also fronds of palm,[foot]a description of the four species ritually waved on Sukkot -- the <em>arba'a minim</em> per Leviticus 23:40 -- the myrtle/<em>hadas</em>, willow/<em>aravah</em>, and palm/<em>lulav</em> branches (sans the etrog).

While details of this voting process are missing, I think the festival should also be celebrated as one in which the declaration of festivals had passed from a time of scriptural fiat to one of some kind of democratic vote.[/foot]  <sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Such then was the end of Antiochus, who was called Epiphanes.
