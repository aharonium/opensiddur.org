The following work, chapters 83-90 in Sefer Ḥanokh (Book of Enoch), dates from the period of the Maccabean struggle, circa 165-161 BCE. It is a remarkable chronicle presenting world history as a predatory conflict. All created beings, from angels to humans, are demoted, one step as it were, to human beings and animals. (The demotions are not static; in the narrative we can read references to the angelification of figures like Noaḥ and Mosheh.) The people of Israel are presented as domesticated creatures -- sheep -- and her enemies as predators. The story emphasizes the theme found earlier in Ḥanokh and elsewhere in Jewish tradition which identifies the <em>yetser hara</em> as the inclination towards predation, the essential foil and antithesis of the divine vision for a just world ruled with compassion by the righteous. For these reasons, it feels both necessary and appropriate to read this story of Ḥanokh <span class="hebrew" lang="he">חֲנוֹךְ</span> on Ḥanukkah <span class="hebrew" lang="he">חֲנֻכָּה</span>. 

As far as we know,[foot]"According to the former chief editor of the official Dead Sea Scrolls editorial team, John Strugnell (deceased 2007), the scroll is well preserved, and microfilmed. Strugnell said that he was shown the microfilm in 1990, during the Kuwait crisis, but he was never able to buy it for the editorial team." (via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aramaic_Enoch_Scroll">wikipedia</a>, citing "<a href="https://www.baslibrary.org/biblical-archaeology-review/20/4/5">An Interview with John Strugnell</a>". <em>The BAS Library</em>.) Alas, there is no evidence besides the word of John Strugnell.[/foot] the text of Sefer Ḥanokh did not survive in its original Hebrew or Aramaic. The fragments of Aramaic that were recovered by the Dead Sea Scroll investigations are here supplemented by its translation in Ge'ez preserved by the Ethiopian Church and the latter's translation in English. --Aharon Varady

<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;I saw all the sheep which had been left, and all the beasts on the earth, and all the birds of the heaven, falling down and doing homage to those sheep and making petition to and obeying them in every thing. <sup>31</sup>&nbsp;Thereafter those three who were clothed in white and had seized me by my hand [who had taken me up before], and the hand of that ram also seizing hold of me, they took me up and set me down in the midst of those sheep before the judgement took place. <sup>32</sup>&nbsp;Those sheep were all white, and their wool was abundant and clean. <sup>33</sup>&nbsp;All that had been destroyed and dispersed, and all the beasts of the field, and all the birds of the heaven, assembled in that house, and the Lord of the sheep rejoiced with great joy because they were all good and had returned to His house. <sup>34</sup>&nbsp;I saw till they laid down that sword, which had been given to the sheep, and they brought it back into the house, and it was sealed before the presence of the Lord, and all the sheep were invited into that house, but it held them not. <sup>35</sup>&nbsp;The eyes of them all were opened, and they saw the good, and there was not one among them that did not see. <sup>36</sup>&nbsp;I saw that that house was large and broad and very full.

<hr />

This is chapters 83-90 of Sefer Ḥanokh (the Book of Enoch) also called the Animal Apocalypse. The English translation presented here is lightly adapted from the one made by Robert Henry Charles based upon the Ge'ez translation in the canon of the Ethiopian Church. The digital text of the Ge'ez was made available by <a href="https://www.tau.ac.il/~hacohen/Henoch/Henoch%2083.html">Ran HaCohen</a>. Where the digital text differs from that published by Charles, we have made a note. Following Charles's text, I have added verse numbers. I have also added paragraph breaks where they seemed sensible. The Aramaic fragments are those found among the Dead Sea Scrolls. Transcription and vocalization of the Aramaic fragments by Isaac Gantwerk Mayer (thank you!). --Aharon Varady
