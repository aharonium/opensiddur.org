Through the frame of a mytho-historical chronicle narrated by an angel, Sefer haYovelim provides more than a gloss on most of Genesis through the giving of the Torah in Exodus. The unknown author presents a raison d'etre for the giving of the Torah itself in the context of world history, the human condition, and the existence of predation in Nature. It is one of the earliest pedagogical works (if not the earliest) explaining the purpose of Jewish teaching and practice to Jewish readers, in circumscribing the predatory passions that entered the world during the generation of the Flood. It is the earliest Jewish work providing a connection between the celebration of the festival of Shavuot (Pentecost) and the celebration of the giving of the Torah on Mt. Sinai. 

We are grateful to Dr. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160415140645/http://theology.nd.edu:80/people/faculty/james-c-vanderkam/">James VanderKam</a> for preparing this critical text of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Jubilees">Book of Jubilees</a> (<em>Sefer haYovelim</em>) in its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ge'ez_language">Ge'ez</a> translation in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ge'ez_script">Ethiopic script</a>. The book of Jubilees is an early Jewish deuterocanonical text composed in Hebrew during the Second Temple period sometime before the Maccabean struggle (167 BCE). In the introduction to his translation of Jubilees, Dr. VanderKam writes:

<blockquote>The present writer has argued at length that Jubilees was written between 161 and 152, while George Nickelsburg and Jonathan Goldstein have defended a date just before 167 B.C.[E.] on the grounds that the author betrays his knowledge of events that occurred in the first part of Antiochus IV's reign but is not aware of his religious edict which was promulgated in 167....[foot]NICKELSBURG, Jewish Literature Between the Bible and the Mishnah (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1981) 78-79; GOLDSTEIN, «The Date of the Book of Jubilees», PAAJR 50 (1983) 63-86. The apocalypse in Jubilees 23 plays a large part in these two attempts at dating.[/foot] 

Today students of the book agree that it was composed in Hebrew and that from Hebrew it was translated into Greek. It has been suggested...that a Hebrew text also served as the base for a Syriac translation, but it is not certain that there was a full Syriac translation and that, if there was one, it rendered a Hebrew rather than a Greek model. Copies of the Greek version of Jubilees then became the Vorlagen of translations into Latin and Ethiopic.

....The only version which preserves the complete text of Jubilees is the Ethiopic. The book was apparently translated from Greek at an early stage in the development of Ethiopic literature and enjoyed canonical status in the Abyssinian Church.</blockquote>

<sup>1:1</sup>&nbsp;During the first year of the Israelites' exodus from Egypt, in the third month — on the sixteenth of the month — the Lord said to Moses: «Come up to me on the mountain. I will give you the two stone tablets of the law and the commandments which I have written so that you may teach them». <sup>1:2</sup>&nbsp;So Moses went up the mountain of the Lord. The glory of the Lord took up residence on Mt. Sinai, and a cloud covered it for six days. <sup>1:3</sup>&nbsp;When he summoned Moses into the cloud on the seventh day, he saw the glory of the Lord like a fire blazing on the summit of the mountain. <sup>1:4</sup>&nbsp;Moses remained on the mountain for 40 days and 40 nights while the Lord showed him what (had happened) beforehand as well as what was to come. He related to him the divisions of all the times — both of the law and of the testimony. <sup>1:5</sup>&nbsp;He said to him: «Pay attention to all the words which I tell you on this mountain. Write (them) in a book so that their offspring may see that I have not abandoned them because of all the evil they have done in straying from the covenant between me and you which I am making today on Mt. Sinai for their offspring. <sup>1:6</sup>&nbsp;So it will be that when all of these things befall them they will recognize that I have been more faithful than they in all their judgments and in all their actions. They will recognize that I have indeed been with them.

He sanctified it for all ages and set it as a sign for all his works. <sup>2:2</sup>&nbsp;For on the first day he created the heavens that are above, the earth, the waters, and all the spirits who serve before him, namely: the angels of the presence; the angels of holiness; the angels of the spirits of fire; the angels of the spirits of the winds; the angels of the spirits of the clouds, of darkness, snow, hail, and frost; the angels of the sounds, the thunders, and the lightnings; and the angels of the spirits of cold and heat, of winter, spring, autumn, and summer, and of all the spirits of his creatures which are in the heavens, on earth, and in every (place). [There were also] the depths, darkness and light, dawn and evening which he prepared through the knowledge of his mind. <sup>2:3</sup>&nbsp;Then we saw his works and blessed him. We offered praise before him regarding all his works because he had made seven great works on the first day.

<sup>3:8</sup>&nbsp;In the first week Adam and his wife — the rib — were created, and in the second week he showed her to him. Therefore, a commandment was given to keep (women) in their defilement seven days for a male (child) and for a female two (units) of seven days. <sup>3:9</sup>&nbsp;After 40 days had come to an end for Adam in the land where he had been created, we brought him into the Garden of Eden to work and keep it. His wife was brought (there) on the eightieth day. After this she entered the Garden of Eden. <sup>3:10</sup>&nbsp;For this reason a commandment was written in the heavenly tablets for the one who gives birth to a child: if she gives birth to a male, she is to remain in her impurity for seven days like the first seven days; then for 33 days she is to remain in the blood of purification. She is not to touch any sacred thing nor to enter the sanctuary until she completes these days for a male. <sup>3:11</sup>&nbsp;As for a female she is to remain in her impurity for two weeks of days like the first two weeks and 66 days in the blood of purification. Their total is 80 days. <sup>3:12</sup>&nbsp;After she had completed these 80 days, we brought her into the Garden of Eden because it is the holiest in the entire earth, and every tree which is planted in it is holy. <sup>3:13</sup>&nbsp;For this reason the law of these days has been ordained for the one who gives birth to a male or a female. She is not to touch any sacred thing nor to enter the sanctuary until the time when those days for a male or a female are completed. <sup>3:14</sup>&nbsp;These are the law and testimony that were written for Israel to keep for all times.

<sup>7:1</sup>&nbsp;During the seventh week, in its first year, in this jubilee [1317] Noah planted a vine at the mountain (whose name was Lubar, one of the mountains of Ararat) on which the ark had come to rest. It produced fruit in the fourth year [1320]. He guarded its fruit and picked it that year during the seventh month. <sup>7:2</sup>&nbsp;He made wine from it, put it in a container, and kept it until the fifth year [1321] — until the first day at the beginning of the first month. <sup>7:3</sup>&nbsp;He joyfully celebrated the day of this festival. He made a burnt offering for the Lord — one young bull, one ram, seven sheep each a year old, and one kid — to make atonement through it for himself and for his sons. <sup>7:4</sup>&nbsp;First he prepared the kid. He put some of its blood on the meat (that was on) the altar which he had made. He offered all the fat on the altar where he made the burnt offering along with the bull, the ram, and the sheep. He offered all their meat on the altar. <sup>7:5</sup>&nbsp;On it he placed their entire sacrifice mixed with oil. Afterwards he sprinkled wine in the fire that had been on the altar beforehand. He put frankincense on the altar and offered a pleasant fragrance that was pleasing before the Lord his God. <sup>7:6</sup>&nbsp;He was very happy, and he and his sons happily drank some of this wine.

<sup>7:20</sup>&nbsp;During the twenty-eighth jubilee [1324-72] Noah began to prescribe for his grandsons the ordinances and the commandments — every statute which he knew.

There was a flame and an oven was smoking. Fiery flames passed between what was spread out. <sup>14:18</sup>&nbsp;On that day the Lord concluded a covenant with Abram with these words: 'To your descendants I will give this land from the river of Egypt as far as the great river, the Euphrates River: the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim, the Phakorites, the Hivites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites'. <sup>14:19</sup>&nbsp;It passed (along), and Abram offered what had been spread out, the birds, their (cereal) offering, and their libation. The fire devoured them. <sup>14:20</sup>&nbsp;During this night we concluded a covenant with Abram like the covenant which we concluded during this month with Noah.

<sup>15:33</sup>&nbsp;I am now telling you that the Israelites will prove false to this ordinance. They will not circumcise their sons in accord with this entire law because they will leave some of the flesh of their circumcision when they circumcise their sons. All the people of Belial will leave their sons uncircumcised just as they were born. <sup>15:34</sup>&nbsp;Then there will be great anger from the Lord against the Israelites because they neglected his covenant, departed from his word, provoked, and blasphemed in that they did not perform the ordinance of this sign. For they have made themselves like the nations so as to be removed and uprooted from the earth. They will no longer have forgiveness or pardon so that they should be pardoned and forgiven for every sin, for (their) violation of this eternal (ordinance).

<sup>17:15</sup>&nbsp;During the seventh week, in the first year during the first month — on the twelfth of this month — in this jubilee [2003], there were voices in heaven regarding Abraham, that he was faithful in everything that he told him, (that) the Lord loved him, and (that) in every difficulty he was faithful. <sup>17:16</sup>&nbsp;Then Prince Mastema came and said before God: 'Abraham does indeed love his son Isaac and finds him more pleasing than anyone else. Tell him to offer him as a sacrifice on an altar. Then you will see whether he performs this order and will know whether he is faithful in everything through which you test him'. <sup>17:17</sup>&nbsp;Now the Lord was aware that Abraham was faithful in every difficulty which he had told him. For he had tested him through his land and the famine; he had tested him through the wealth of kings; he had tested him again through his wife when she was taken forcibly, and through circumcision; and he had tested him through Ishmael and his servant girl Hagar when he sent them away. <sup>17:18</sup>&nbsp;In everything through which he tested him he was found faithful. He himself did not grow impatient, nor was he slow to act; for he was faithful and one who loved the Lord.

He had grown old and (his) time was completed. <sup>23:9</sup>&nbsp;For the times of the ancients were 19 jubilees for their lifetimes. After the flood they started to decrease from 19 jubilees, to be fewer with respect to jubilees, to age quickly, and to have their times be completed in view of the numerous difficulties and through the wickedness of their ways — with the exception of Abraham. <sup>23:10</sup>&nbsp;For Abraham was perfect with the Lord in everything that he did — being properly pleasing throughout all his lifetime. And yet (even) he had not completed four jubilees during his lifetime when he became old — in view of wickedness — and reached the end of his time. <sup>23:11</sup>&nbsp;All the generations that will come into being from now until the great day of judgment will grow old quickly — before they complete two jubilees. It will be their knowledge that will leave them because of their old age; all of their knowledge will depart. <sup>23:12</sup>&nbsp;At that time, if a man lives a jubilee and one-half of years, it will be said about him: 'He has lived for a long time'. But the greater part of his time will be (characterized by) difficulties, toil, and distress without peace, <sup>23:13</sup>&nbsp;because (there will be) blow upon blow, wound upon wound, distress upon distress, bad news upon bad news, disease upon disease, and every (kind of) bad punishment like this, one with the other: disease and stomach pains; snow, hail, and frost; fever, cold, and numbness; famine, death, sword, captivity, and every (sort of) blow and difficulty. <sup>23:14</sup>&nbsp;All of this will happen to the evil generation which makes the earth commit sin through sexual impurity, contamination, and their detestable actions.

Everything that they do is impure and something detestable; all their ways are (characterized by) contamination, and corruption. <sup>23:18</sup>&nbsp;The earth will indeed be destroyed because of all that they do. There will be no produce from the vine and no oil because what they do (constitutes) complete disobedience.
