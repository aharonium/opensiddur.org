Our services are conducted with pomp and precision. The rendition of the liturgy is smooth. Everything is present: decorum, voice, ceremony. But one thing is missing: <em>Life</em>. One knows in advance what will ensue. There will be no surprise, no adventure of the soul; there will be no sudden burst of devotion. Nothing is going to happen to the soul. Nothing unpredictable must happen to the person who prays. He will attain no insight into the words he reads; he will attain no new perspective for the life he lives.

We have developed the habit of <em>praying by proxy</em>. Many congregants seem to have adopted the principle of vicarious prayer. The rabbi or the cantor does the praying for the congregation.

They recite the prayerbook as if it were last week's newspaper. They ensconce in anonymity — as if prayer were an impersonal exercise — as if worship were an act that came automatically. The words are there but the souls who are to feel their meaning, to absorb their significance, are absent. They utter shells of syllables, but put nothing of themselves into the shells. In our daily speech, in uttering a sentence, our words have a tonal quality. There is no communication without intonation. It is the intonation that indicates what we mean by what we say, so that we can discern whether we hear a question or an assertion.

That we sensed that this is a problem is evidenced by the many valiant but futile attempts to deal with it. The problem, namely, of how to increase synagogue attendance.

The doctrine of Agnosticism claims that prayer is rooted in superstition. It is “one of humanity’s greatest mistakes” “a desparate effort of bewildered creatures to come to terms with surrounding mystery.” Thus, prayer is a fraud. To the worshipping man we must say: “Fool, why do you in vain beseech with childish prayers, things which no day ever did bring, will bring, or could bring?”[foot]Ovid, <em>Tristia</em>, III, 8.11.[/foot] Since it is dangerous fraud, the synagogue must be abolished.

As a personal attitude religious behaviorism usually reflects a widely held theology in which the supreme article of faith is <em>respect for tradition</em>. People are urged to observe the rituals or to attend services out of deference to what has come down to us from our ancestors. The <em>theology of respect</em> pleads for the maintenance of the inherited and transmitted customs and institutions and is characterized by a spirit of conformity, excessive moderation and disrespect of spontaneity. The outlook of religious behaviorists comes close to the view embodied in Seneca's saying, <em>tamquam legibus iussa non tamquam dis grata</em> (observe religious customs because they are commanded by law, not because they are desired by the gods).

There is another definition which is being perpetuated all over the country in sermons, synagogue bulletins and books. “<em>Prayer is the identification of the worshipper with the people of Israel</em>,” or “the occasion for immersing ourselves in the living reality” of our people. It is built on a theology which regards God as a symbol of social action, as an epitome of the ideals of the group, as “the spirit of the beloved community”;[foot]J. Royce, <em>The Problem of Christianity</em>, 1913, 1, pp. 172, 408f.[/foot] as “the spirit of a people, and insofar as there is a world of humanity...the Spirit of the World”;[foot]E. S.

“An act of identification with the people” is, phenomenologically speaking, the definition of a political act. But is a political phenomenon the same as worship? Moreover, is the act of identification with the Jewish people necessarily an act of serving God? Who is our model: Elijah who disassociated himself from the congregations of his people, or the prophets of the Baal who led and identified themselves with their people? The prophets of Israel were not eager to be in agreement with popular sentiments. Spiritually important, essential, and sacred as the identification with the people Israel is, we must not forget that what lends spiritual importance and sanctity to that identification is Israel's unique association with the will of God. It is this association that raises our attachment to the people Israel above the level of mere nationalism.

It is true that a Jew never worships as an isolated individual but as a part of the people Israel. Yet it is within the heart of every individual that prayer takes place. It is a personal duty, and an intimate act which cannot be delegated to either the cantor or to the whole community. We pray with all of Israel, and everyone of us by himself. Contrary to sociological theories, individual prayer came first, while collective prayer is a late phenomenon which is not even mentioned in the Bible.[foot]"מזמן משה רבינו ע״ה עד כנסת הגדולה...לא היו מתקבצים ישראל בכל מקומות מושבותם ערב ובקר וצהרים במקום מיוחד להתפלל בו תפלת צבור, אלא כל אחד היה מתפלל ביחיד במקום שיודמן לו. כי לא מצאנו בנביאים וכתובים תפלת צבור עד אחד החרבן שתקנו אנשי כנסת הגדולה י״ח בְּרַכוֹת ודברים שבקדושה שאינן בפחות מעשרה", ר׳ משה בר׳ יוסף מטראני, בית אלהים, ויניציאה של״ו.[/foot]

Such sociological perspectives forfeit the unique aspects of Judaism. Do we, in the moment of prayer, concentrate on the group? We read in the Psalms “Give ear to my words, O Lord, understand my meditation.” According to the Midrash, David said, “Lord of the World, at the time when I have strength to stand before Thee in prayer and to bring forth words — give ear! At a time when I have no strength to bring forth words — understand what is in my heart, understand my faltering.”[foot]"אֲמָרַי הַאֲזִינָה ה׳ בִּינָה הֲגִיגִי (תהלים ה:ב) אמר דוד לפני הקדוש ברוך הוא: רבונו של עולם, בשעה שיש לי כח לעמוד לפניך בתפלה ולהוציא אמרי האזינה. ובשעה שאין בי כח התבונן מה בלבי בינה הגיגי." מדרש תהלים ה:ד.[/foot] Can the sociological definition of prayer as an act of identification with the group be applied to this Midrash?

The doctrine maintains that the individual self of the worshipper is the whole sphere of prayer-life. The assumption is that God is an idea, a process, a source, a fountain, a spring, a power. But one cannot pray to an idea, one cannot address his prayers to a fountain of values. To whom, then, do we direct our prayers? Yes, there is an answer. As a recent writer put it: We address “prayers to the good within ourselves.”[foot]A discussion of this view, which is so popular today, is found in I.

I do not wish to minimize the fact that we all suffer from an ego-centric predicament. Our soul tends to confine itself to its own ideas, interests, and emotions. But why should we raise the ego-centric affliction to the status of a virtue? It is precisely the function of prayer to overcome that predicament, to see the world in a different setting. The self is not the hub but the spoke of the revolving wheel. It is precisely the function of prayer to shift the center of living from self-consciousness to self-surrender.[foot]Cf. A.J. Heschel, “<a href="https://opensiddur.org/divrei-tefillah/pedagogy/prayer-by-abraham-joshua-heschel-1945/">Prayer</a>" in <em>Review of Religion</em>, January 1945, p. 156.[/foot]

We are descendants of those who taught the world what true worship is. Our fathers created the only universal language there is: the language of prayer. All men in the Western world speak to God in the language of our prayers, of our Psalms. Is it not proper to ask our fathers: What is the spirit of Jewish prayer? But are we ready to ask the question? Are we qualified to understand the answer? The difficulty of our situation lies in the fact that we have inherited physical features of our fathers but failed to acquire some of their spiritual qualities. Biologically we are Jews, theologically we are pagan to a considerable degree. Our hands are the hands of Jacob, but our voice is often the voice of Esau.

Now what qualifies a person to be a rabbi? What gives him the right, the privilege to represent the word of God to the people of God? I have been in the United States of America for thirteen years. I have not discovered America but I have discovered something in America. It is possible to be a rabbi and not to believe in the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.[foot]“It would appear that the God-concept of the preponderant majority of the rabbis is free from anthropomorphism and the notion of the first cause. Only two rabbis in the entire group of 218 define God as a first cause, and only one out of every seven, as literal creator of the universe — the two supernaturalistic responses. The remainder believe that the nature of God is best expressed as: (a) “the sum total of forces which make for greater intelligence, beauty, goodness; (b) the unitary creative impulse which expresses itself in organic evolution and human progress; (c) the symbol of all that we consider good and true.” The first of these three views of God is by far the dominant one.

“With respect to the God-idea, no appreciable difference can be seen between Conservative and Reform wings. These two groups differ, however, from the Orthodox group, a majority of whom think of God primarily as a creator. In both the Conservative and the Reform wings this concept of God which best expresses the views of the rabbis is held by only about 8 percent of the respondents.” — J.

Prayer is the microcosm of the soul. It is the whole soul in one moment; the quintessence of all our acts; the climax of all our thoughts. It rises as high as our thoughts. Now, if Torah is nothing but national literature of Jewish people; if the mystery of revelation is discarded as superstition, then prayer is hardly more than a soliloquy. If God does not have power to speak to us, how should we possess the power to speak to Him? Thus, prayer is a part of a greater issue. It depends upon the total spiritual situation of man and upon a mind within which God is at home. Of course, if our lives are too barren to bring forth the spirit of worship; if all our thoughts and anxieties do not contain enough spiritual substance to be distilled into prayer, an inner transformation is a matter of emergency. And such an emergency we face today. <em>The issue of prayer is not prayer; the issue of prayer is God</em>. One cannot pray unless he has faith in his own ability to accost the infinite, merciful, eternal God.

How should we define prayer? Since it is, first of all, a phenomenon of the human consciousness, we must ask; What is it that a person is conscious of in a moment of prayer? There is a classical statement in rabbinic literature that expresses the spiritual minimum of prayer as an act of the consciousness of man: “<em>Know before Whom you stand</em>.”[foot]"כשחלה ר׳ אליעזר נכנסו תלמידיו לבקרו, אמרו לו: [רבינו] למדנו אורחות חיים...אמר להם...וכשאתם מתפללים דעו לפני מי אתה עומדים." בְּרַכוֹת כח ב׳; אבות דרבי נתן, נוסחא א׳, פי״ט. עיין ארחות חיים לר׳ אליעזר הגדול, "י״ח: בני, כשתכנס לפני יוצרך תכנס באימה וביראה וכשאתה מתפלל דע לפני מי אתה עומד."[/foot] Three ideas are contained in this definition.[foot]The sentence consists of three parts: The main verb in the imperative “know.” Dependent on this main verb is the clause “before whom you stand” which can be broken up into two segments, the adverbial phrase “before whom” which contains the interrogative pronoun and “you stand” which is the subject and verb of the subordinate clause.[/foot]

Throughout many centuries of Jewish history the true motivation for prayer was not “the sense of being at home at the universe” but the sense of <em>not</em> being at home in the universe. We could not but experience anxiety and spiritual homelessness in the sight of so much suffering and evil, in the countless examples of failure to live up to the will of God. That experience gained in intensity by the soul-stirring awareness that God Himself was not at home in a universe, where His will is defied, where His kingship is denied. <em>The Sheḳinah is in exile</em>, the world is corrupt, <em>the universe itself is not at home</em>....

There is a specific difficulty of Jewish prayer. There are laws: how to pray, when to pray, what to pray. There are fixed times, fixed ways, fixed texts.[foot]According to Rabbi Yose, "He who alters the form of benedictions fixed by the wise has failed to fulfil his obligations” (Berachoth 40b; Yerushalmi Berachoth VI, 2, 10b). Rabbi Meir declares it to he the duty of every one to say one hundred benedictions daily (Menahoth 43a, see Numbers Rabba XVIII).[/foot] On the other hand, prayer is worship of the heart, the outpouring of the soul, a matter of <span class="hebrew">כַּוָּנָה‏</span>. Thus, Jewish prayer is guided by two opposite principles: order and outburst, regularity and spontaneity, uniformity and individuality, law and freedom.[foot]The contrast between order and outburst is made clear through the term <span class="hebrew">קֶבַע‏</span> Shammai said; "Make your <span class="hebrew">תּוֹרָה‏</span> (in the sense of legal decisions made by the scholar) <span class="hebrew">קֶבַע‏</span> (a fixed thing),” Do not be lenient to yourself and severe to others, nor lenient to others and severe to yourself. See אבות, א, ט״ו and the explication in אבות דרבי נתן, p. 47, הוצאת שעכטער, נוסחא ב׳, פרק כ״ג. In contrast Rabbi Shimeon said: When you pray, do not make your prayer a fixed thing (אבות ב׳ י״ח) .(<span class="hebrew">קֶבַע‏</span>) Rabbi Eliezer said: He who makes his prayer a fixed thing (<span class="hebrew">קֶבַע‏</span>), his prayer is not an act of grace (מִשְׁנָה בְּרַכוֹת ד׳ ד׳).[/foot] These principles are the two poles about which Jewish prayer revolves. Since each of the two moves in the opposite direction, equilibrium can only be maintained if both are of equal force. However, the pole of regularity usually proves to be stronger than the pole of spontaneity, and, as a result, there is a perpetual danger of prayer becoming a mere habit, a mechanical performance, an exercise in repetitiousness. The fixed pattern and regularity of our services tends to stifle the spontaneity of devotion. Our great problem, therefore, is how not to let the principle of <span class="hebrew">קֶבַע‏</span> impair the power of <span class="hebrew">כַּוָּנָה‏</span>. It is a problem that concerns not only prayer but the whole sphere of Jewish observance. He who is not aware of this central difficulty is a simpleton; he who offers a simple solution is a quack.

In regard to most aspects of observance, Jewish tradition has for pedagogic reasons given primacy to the principle of <span class="hebrew">קֶבַע‏</span>; there are many rituals concerning which the law maintains that if a person has performed them without proper <span class="hebrew">כַּוָּנָה‏</span>, he is to be regarded <em>ex post facto</em> as having fulfilled his duty. In prayer, however, <span class="hebrew">הֲלָכָה‏</span> insists upon the supremacy of <span class="hebrew">כַּוָּנָה‏</span> over the external performance, at least, theoretically.[foot]The polarity of prayer and the decision in favor of the element of <span class="hebrew">בּוֹנֶה‏</span> is implied in the following discussion.
"איבעיא להו: טעה ולא התפלל מנחה. מהו שיתפלל ערבית שתים?....תפלה במקום קרבן היא. וכיון דעבר יומו בטל קרבנו. או דילמא כיון דצלותא רחמי היא. כל אימת דבעי מצלי ואזיל? תא שמע דאמר רב הונא בר יהודה אמר רבי יצחק אמר רבי יוחנן: טעה ולא התפלל מנחה מתפלל ערבית שתים. ואין בזה משום דעבר יומו בטל קרבנו." בְּרַכוֹת כ״ו עמוד א׳.[/foot] Thus, Maimonides declares: “Prayer without <span class="hebrew">כַּוָּנָה‏</span> is no prayer at all. He who has prayed without <span class="hebrew">כַּוָּנָה‏</span> ought to pray once more. He whose thoughts are wandering or occupied with other things need not pray until he has recovered his mental composure. Hence, on returning from a journey, or if one is weary or distressed, it is forbidden to pray until his mind is composed. The sages said that upon returning from a journey, one should wait three days until he is rested and his mind is calm, then he prays.”[foot]מִשְׁנָה תּוֹרָה, הלכות תפלה פ״ד, ה״ו.[/foot]

The Rabbis insisted: In order to prevent the practice of repeating a prayer for superstitious or magical purposes, the Talmud ordains that a person who says the word “<em>Hear</em>” (<em>O Israel</em>) or the word “<em>We thank Thee</em>” twice, is to be silenced.

In our liturgy we go beyond a mere hope; every seventh day we proclaim as a fact <span class="hebrew">נִשְׁמַת כָּל חַי תְּבַרֵךְ אֶת שִׁמְךָ‏</span>. The soul of everything that lives blesses Thy name.[foot]The usual translation “shall bless” totally misses the meaning of the passage.[/foot]

“Prayer without <span class="hebrew">כַּוָּנָה‏</span> is like a body without a soul.” “A word uttered without the fear and love of God does not rise to heaven.” Once Rabbi Levi Yitzhak of Berdychev while visiting a city went to a synagogue. Arriving at the gate he refused to enter. When his disciples inquired what was wrong with the synagogue, they received the reply: “The synagogue is full of words of Torah and prayer.” This seemed the highest praise to his disciples, and even more reason to enter the synagogue. When they questioned him further, Rabbi Levi Yitzhak explained: “Words uttered without fear, uttered without love, do not rise to heaven.

Nor is it the primary purpose of prayer “To promote Jewish unity.” As we said above, prayer is a personal duty, and an intimate act which cannot be delegated to either the cantor or the whole community.

It was in the interest of bringing about order and decorum that in some synagogues the rabbi and cantor decided to occupy a position facing the congregation.

To assess Judaism soberly and farsightedly is to establish it as a good to be preferred, if necessary, to any alternative which we may ever face.

"The Spirit of Jewish Prayer," by Abraham Joshua Heschel was a speech given at the Fifty-Third Annual Convention of the Rabbinical Assembly of America which took place at the Breakers Hotel, Atlantic City, New Jersey from Tammuz 9 to Tammuz 14, 5713 (June 22 To June 27, 1953). The speech was subsequently published in the <em>Proceedings of the Rabbinical Assembly of America</em> v.17. I have added additional citation references not included in the intial printing of the speech and digitally transcribed all the Hebrew text, adding niqud to improve access and readability. --Aharon N. Varady 

Edward Kaplan provides important context for presentation and aftermath of Heschel's speech in his book, <em>Spiritual Radical: Abraham Joshua Heschel in America, 1940–1972</em> (Yale University Press 2007). Below are the specific paragraphs from ch. 8, "Critique of American Judaism (1952–1954): The Soul of Conservative Judaism" p. 146-151 that include Heschel's remarks following its reception. (Please read Kaplan's book for the full account.)

<blockquote>That summer [of 1953], Heschel delivered his fullest critique of American Jewish practice. Recognizing that the bourgeoning of synagogues in suburbia had not enhanced the quality of observance and religious learning, leaders of the Reform and Conservative rabbinates separately invited Heschel to define his ideal of prayer to colleagues in the field. During the week of 22–27 June 1953, he embarked upon a sort of shuttle diplomacy, delivering his most detailed outline of what he thought rabbis of all denominations should strive for.[foot]While Heschel was trying to reinvigorate the American Jewish community, he was losing many friends from his Yiddish-speaking immigrant world. On 14 March 1953, Hayim Greenberg, editor of <em>Yidisher Kemfer</em> and <em>Jewish Frontier</em>, died at age sixty-three. On 31 March, Abraham Reisen, known as “the dean of Yiddish poets,” died at age seventy-seven. Reisen was born in Koidanov, Russia, the home of Heschel’s maternal relatives. In addition to these personal losses, Heschel was dismayed by the execution on 19 June of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg for espionage. The officiating rabbi at their funeral two days later was Abraham Cronbach, Heschel’s friend from Hebrew Union College.[/foot]

To each group, Heschel asserted exactly what its members did not want to hear. Conservative Judaism, like Orthodox, emphasized law (halakhah) and ritual observance over cultivation of the inner life; Reform rejected the authority of halakhah in favor of rational philosophy and individual choice. To the leaders of each movement Heschel tailored his counterdiscourse to restore the fullness of Judaism, contradictions and all....

Heschel’s keynote speech, “The Spirit of Jewish Prayer,” followed the presidential report. Heschel began diplomatically, anticipating some hurt feelings: “In advancing some critical remarks I do not mean, God forbid [in Hebrew], to take a superior attitude. In all honesty, my criticism will be to a considerable degree self-criticism.” But those criticisms of the congregational rabbis were harsh: “Our services are conducted with pomp and precision. The rendition of the liturgy is smooth. Everything is present: decorum, voice, ceremony. But one thing is missing: Life.” Heschel’s images were graphic and his tone was caustic: “Has the synagogue become the graveyard where prayer is buried? Are we, the spiritual leaders of American Jewry, members of a chevrah kadisha [burial society]?”[foot]Heschel 1953, “The Spirit of Jewish Prayer,” Proceedings 1953, 151. Heschel incorporated a revised version of the speech into chapter 3 of Man’s Quest for God, “Spontaneity is the Goal,” 49–89. All quotations in the text are from the original Proceedings version, which contains a number of Hebrew words, phrases, and quotations.[/foot]

To define the substance of authentic prayer Heschel denounced “the habit of praying by proxy,” letting the rabbi and the cantor do the work: “Our prayers have so little charm, so little grace, so little chen [grace; Hebrew]. What is chen? The presence of the soul. A person has chen when the throbbing of his heart is audible in his voice; when the longings of his soul animate his face.” He deplored the “spiritual absenteeism” of congregants who simply attended services without truly participating. Faulty thinking, he claimed, was to blame for such apathy.

Heschel summarized the four “prevalent doctrines” of God and Judaism, measuring each view by the standards of a living God. His analyses were stark, provocative, and verging on caricature. First was “the doctrine of agnosticism,” which considered “prayer [to be] a fraud.” Heschel condemned those who believed that “the only way to revitalize the synagogue is to minimize the importance of prayer and to convert the synagogue into a center. It is something which the Talmud characterizes as sin: ‘To call a Holy Ark a chest and to call a synagogue a community center [in Hebrew].’ ” These strictures were obviously directed at Reconstructionists and their secularizing sympathizers.

Second, he denounced “the doctrine of religious behaviorism,” widespread among Orthodox and some Conservative Jews, in which people “seem to believe that religious deeds can be performed in a spiritual wasteland, in the absence of the soul, with a heart hermetically sealed.” Heschel was alluding to the foremost exponent of modern Orthodoxy, Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik, who defined the ideal Jew as “Halakhic Man.”[foot]A simplistic reading of Soloveitchik’s foundational essay, “Halakhic Man,” might suggest that it was only necessary to follow the rules; one did not have to strive for attachment to God: Soloveitchik 1983.[/foot]

Heschel then targeted Reform (and numerous Conservative) Jews imbued with the view of Judaism as a civilization. They were proponents of the “doctrine of prayer as a social act,” which “is built on a theology which regards God as a symbol of social action, as an epitome of the ideals of the group, as ‘the spirit of the beloved community.’ ” Although Heschel strategically did not name the obvious author of this faulty ideology, Mordecai Kaplan, his condemnation of what he called the “sociological fallacy” could not be more explicit.[foot]In the printed version, Heschel referred in a footnote (Proceedings 153, 156n3) to Josiah Royce’s The Problem of Christianity (1913), rather than Kaplan’s Judaism as a Civilization (1934) when citing a Kaplanian axiom: God is a symbol of social action, “the spirit of the beloved community.”[/foot] Heschel’s fourth and final target was a variant of “process theology,” which he caricatured as “the doctrine of religious solipsism.” According to that view, “the individual self of the worshiper is the whole sphere of prayer-life. The assumption is that God is an idea, a process, a source, a fountain, a spring, a power. But one cannot pray to an idea, one cannot address his payers to a fountain of values.” Once more, Heschel avoided singling out specific thinkers within his community by attacking a 1911 book by the French psychologist Joseph Segond.[foot]“A discussion of this view, which is so popular today, is found in I. [Joseph] Segond, La prière, étude de psychologie religieuse, Paris, 1911, p. 52”: Proceedings 1953, 158n7a.[/foot]

Heschel warned that American Jews were undergoing a crisis of belief. The problem among their leaders too was widespread: “I have been in the United States of America for thirteen years. I have not discovered America but I have discovered something in America. It is possible to be a rabbi and not to believe in the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.” Most American rabbis, according to a survey he cited, conceived of God as “the sum total of forces which make for greater intelligence, beauty, goodness.” Heschel demanded faith in a personal God, for “if the presence of God is a myth, then we are insane in talking to Him.” The risks of such intransigence were enormous.[foot]Heschel is referring to Joseph Zeitlin, <em>Disciples of the Wise: The Religious and Social Opinions of American Rabbis</em> (New York: Teachers Institute, Columbia University, 1945), 76. See also Proceedings 1953, 163: “Decisive is not the mystic experience of our being close to Him; decisive is not our feeling but our certainty of His being close to us.”[/foot]

Once again Heschel refused to compromise. God’s presence in the world was at stake: as he had noted in Man Is Not Alone, “Great is the power of prayer. For to worship is to expand the presence of God in the world. God is transcendent, but our worship of Him makes him immanent.”[foot]Proceedings 1953, 164, citing Heschel’s footnote to Man Is Not Alone, chap. 23.[/foot] Heschel concluded with several suggestions on how to maintain the centrality of prayer. Jews should concentrate on “how to pray,” not “what to say.” Poking fun at the Prayer Book Commission, Heschel called for a “Prayer Commission.” He also suggested that the rabbi and cantor stop facing the congregation, an innovation that had been made for the sake of decorum: “It is embarrassing to be exposed to the sight of the whole congregation in moments when one wishes to be alone with his God. A cantor who faces the holiness in the Ark rather than the curiosity of man will realize that his audience is God.” Finally, urged Heschel, rabbis, teachers, and cantors must embody the “absolute significance” of being a Jew.

In “The Spirit of Jewish Prayer,” Heschel bore radical witness to the need for an American Jewish theology. But his was a lonely voice. With his demand for absolute integrity, how could he expect support from the majority? He himself had cited statistical proof that most American rabbis did not believe in God. In addition, Heschel’s insistence on the magnitude of human evil undercut the optimism of American Jews in the 1950s. His view, compatible with Hasidic tradition and the recent cataclysm of the Holocaust, was that humans’ alienation from God reflected “the soul-stirring awareness that God Himself was not at home in a universe, where His will is defied, where His kingship is denied. The Shekhinah is in exile, the world is corrupt, the universe itself is not at home.” Many in Heschel’s audience were offended by his sarcasm; they felt like “whipping boys,” as Arthur Cohen had warned him could happen, and were hurt and angry.

....Then Heschel stood up. He was surprised, “puzzled,” “amazed,” and even “distressed” that his call for authentic prayer in Conservative synagogues had provoked such indignation. But even as he attempted to engage in a sympathetic discussion, he revealed his stubborn, insensitive side. He began defensively, insisting that he had postponed his own research to examine “the details of a problem which is specifically and uniquely yours.” But he then acknowledged that “your problems, too, are mine. The assurance that I was speaking in the spirit of self-criticism was not an empty phrase. All my life I have been deeply bothered by my own miserable failure to attain <em>kavvanah</em> in prayer.” Heschel then tried to justify his polemical style. He explained that sharp phrases such as “the separation of synagogue and God,” “decapitated prayer,” or “prayer without God” were intended simply to make his position clear.

[Ira Eisenstein, president of the Rabbinical Assembly and a leader in the Reconstructionist Movement,] invited the principal speakers [Heschel and Eugene Kohn, another Reconstructionist leader,] to have the final word....Heschel spoke first, asserting that most misunderstandings were matters of emphasis and repeating his avowal that true prayer was difficult for him to achieve: “I am profoundly embarrassed by the inadequacy of my praying. I have no peace of mind, nor do I submit to despair.” Then he made an astounding admission, which drew him closer to some of his listeners: “I have been wrestling with the problem all my life as to whether I really mean God when I pray to Him, whether I have even succeeded in knowing what I am talking about and whom I am talking to. I still don’t know whether I serve God or I serve something else.” This was not a confession of agnosticism; Heschel did not doubt the reality of God. But, as a sophisticated thinker, he realized that he was handicapped by the inadequacy of language to evoke the ultimate. Religious reality was essentially “ineffable.” The task of his philosophy of religion, systematic reflection on the experience of piety, was to elucidate the dilemma of faith.

He also attempted to modify some of his criticisms. He had not dismissed decorum in the synagogue as such, nor did he condemn interpretation of the liturgy. He only questioned approaching the problem of prayer with “historic information rather than commitment, rather than inner identification.” A rabbi must be able to discover “something new, something fresh” in his heart: “I do not refer to any supernatural events or to any scholarly discoveries. I refer to countless moments of insight which can be gained from communing with the individual words.”

But he continued to assert the authority of his own intuition, thereby cutting himself off from rationalists who preferred intellectual constructs. Heschel denied that he had spoken of “a concept or demanded the acceptance of a definition. We Jews have no concepts; all we have is faith, faith in His willingness to listen to us. We have no information, but we sense and believe in His being near to us.” Heschel seemed to accept only one answer to his own question: “Whom am I serving when I use the word God?”

Heschel did attempt to recover some common ground by respecting his “opponents” as human beings: “The strange thing about many of our contemporaries is that their life is nobler than their ideology, that their faith is deep and their views shallow, that their souls are suppressed and their slogans proclaimed.” Discreetly but unmistakably Heschel was alluding to Mordecai Kaplan: “We must not continue to cherish a theory, just because we have embraced it forty years ago.” In the end, his response did not advance the dialogue, for all his attempts to do so.</blockquote>
