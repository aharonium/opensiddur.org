Hello friends,

Check out our progress! This  development status update chronicles progress on the Open Siddur made  since our last update, February 15, 2010.

If you’d like to get news of Open  Siddur Project development as it occurs, make sure to follow <a rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/opensiddur" target="_blank">@opensiddur</a> at Twitter, or join  the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://groups.google.com/group/opensiddur-announce" target="_blank">opensiddur-announce</a> email list. We also recommend following updates on <a href="http://opensiddur.org" target="_blank">opensiddur.org</a> with our RSS feed. (Just visit this URL with your favorite RSS reader: <a href="http://opensiddur.org/feed/" target="_blank">http://opensiddur.org/feed/</a> .)

The creative work used in our traditional liturgies is  the common  cultural heritage of the Jewish people. Most of this work resides in the  public domain. The Open Siddur is your Siddur. Join the Open Siddur  Project  today and begin crafting and sharing the siddur you’ve always wanted.

<em>Project Overview</em>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Ever wonder what our project looks like as a flowchart? Aharon updated the old one to be more readable -- do you get it?</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Did you want an Open Siddur web application last year and aren't sure how you can help bring it into reality? Check out <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/opensiddur-talk/browse_thread/thread/7a54df30d636bed3">these ways you can help advance this project</a> -- even if you're not a computer programmer!</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Fascinated by technology and wondering how our work fits into the future of book publishing? Check out this link if you were wondering what a print-to-digital-to-print technology project such as our web application can offer the world more generally: http://thinkubator.ccsp.sfu.ca/wikis/xmlProduction/XMLProductionStartWithTheWeb</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"></p>

<em>Project Team Updates </em>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><em> </em>One way of helping to contribute to the project is offering work opportunities for our volunteers, some of whom are unemployed, freelance, and pay for their own health insurance. If you have a job opportunity and need committed workers and creative thinkers, <a href="http://opensiddur.org/contact/" target="_blank">contact  us</a>.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">We welcome Shmueli Gonzales and <span> </span><span>Amir Starr Weg</span> to our team of transcribers. Shmuel's work can already be appreciated <a href="http://opensiddur.org/2010/08/nusa%e1%b8%a5-ha-ari-a-new-transcription-by-shmuel-gonzales/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Ben Varadi may have graduated Tulane's Law School (congrats!) but the Tulane Center for Intellectual Property Law &amp; Culture continues to provide the Open Siddur Project with excellent copyright research thanks to Justin A. Levy and an application that Ben devised, the <a href="http://www.durationator.com/" target="_blank">Durationator</a>. Ben's also created a rather excellent <a href="http://www.diybookscanner.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=262" target="_blank">Book Scanner</a>. Ben's now working for jgrad, a project of the NOLA Jewish federation providing Jewish resources for graduate students and recent college grads.</p>

<em>New Contributions </em>

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">We now have a <a href="http://opensiddur.org/contribute/upload/" target="_blank">contribution form</a> for folk to share their work directly at<a href="http://opensiddur.org" target="_blank"> opensiddur.org</a>. While progress continues on developing our web application, there's no reason we can't begin sharing our work now -- just in a more conventional way.</div>

</ul>

<em>Application Development  (step by step until it's ready)</em>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">We <a href="http://opensiddur.org/2010/04/james-strongs-hebrew-dictionary-in-xml-ftw/" target="_blank">tested</a> and then <a href="http://opensiddur.org/tools/transliterate/" target="_blank">made public</a> our transliteration engine with eight transliteration tables to choose from including International Phonetic Alphabet, Modern Ashkenazi dialect, and Academy of the Hebrew Language.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Efraim documented and tested his encoding engine on the <a href="http://opensiddur.org/2010/08/the-authorised-daily-prayer-book-aka-the-singer-siddur/" target="_blank">Singer Siddur</a>.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Work on a replacement for our transcription/proofreading interface on our wiki is beginning. All transcribers are invited to provide input on the design and function of this transcription interface. (We want to make it easier for you to help us transcribe text.) <a href="http://opensiddur.org/contact/" target="_blank">Contact us</a> directly or share your ideas on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/opensiddur-talk/" target="_blank">opensiddur-talk</a> discussion list.</p>

<em>Communications</em></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">We've made an effort to separate technical discussion into its own area for non-tech participants and followers of the Open Siddur Project.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Most recently we separated the Live Chat conferences we organize on IRC into separate tech and non-tech sessions. Logs are posted here.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Following his session at Limmud NY in January, Aharon Varady gave a <a href="http://opensiddur.org/2010/03/open-siddur-at-the-academy-for-jewish-religion/" target="_blank">public presentation</a> on the Open Siddur Project at the Academy of Jewish Religon's Spring Intensive in Riverdale, NY last March. (Other guest speakers included authors Lawrence Hoffman and Jill Hammer).</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Aharon gave another <a href="http://opensiddur.org/2010/07/some-thoughts-on-how-jewish-nonprofits-can-improve-the-world-and-themselves-with-open-source/" target="_blank">public presentation</a> on the value of Open Source for Jewish non-profits at the Future of Jewish Nonprofit Summit late last month in New York City. Afterwards, Aharon was <a href="http://opensiddur.org/2010/08/radio-613-an-interview-with-aharon-varady-on-open-source-judaism/" target="_blank">interviewed</a> by Radio613's co-hosts Avi and Malcha, on CFRC Kingston, Ontario 101.9 FM.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Efraim <a href="http://opensiddur.org/2010/08/how-you-and-your-students-can-help-build-the-jewish-library-of-the-future-newcaje-1/" target="_blank">presented</a> the Open Siddur Project at the NewCAJE conference for Jewish educators. Follow-up thoughts are <a href="http://opensiddur.org/2010/08/newcaje-1-post-conference-thoughts-and-appeal-to-technologists/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<em>New Documentation </em>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><em> </em>Our <a href="https://github.com/opensiddur/opensiddur-client/wiki/How-to-Enter-a-Text%3A-The-Short-Version" target="_blank">Transcription Rules</a> for transcribing and proofreading text were completely revamped.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Efraim wrote up an introduction to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100507124255/http://wiki.jewishliturgy.org:80/Conditionals" target="_blank">conditional  inclusion feature</a>.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Many, many additions, disambiguations, and edits were made to existing pages on the wiki and at <a href="http://opensiddur.org" target="_blank">opensiddur.org</a> .</p>
