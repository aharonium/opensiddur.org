Almost two years ago my best friend passed away and I had the honour of chanting this <em>maleh rachamim</em> for him. In mid-May this year another friend approached me and said he really liked the way I did it at the time and could I record it for him because he was going to do it too for an unrelated unveiling. So, I recorded it on May 18, 2011. I didn't compose it. It's a traditional tune, but it's my voice and I hope someone else can perhaps learn it with this material. The more resource there are out there through means such as Open Siddur the better we can learn and share.
