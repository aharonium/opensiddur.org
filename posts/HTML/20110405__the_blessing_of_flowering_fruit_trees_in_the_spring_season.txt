When the spring (Aviv) season arrives, a blessing is traditionally said when one is in view of at least two flowering fruit trees.[foot]Source: Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim, 226:1[/foot] In the northern hemisphere, it can be said anytime through the end of the month of Nissan (though it can still be said in Iyar).

Rabbi David Seidenberg (neohasid.org) <a href="http://neohasid.org/stoptheflood/birkat_hailanot/">writes</a>:

<blockquote>The language of the blessing recalls part of the <em>borei n'fashot</em> blessing for food, which thanks God for creating "many souls and all their deficiencies" <em>ḥesronan</em>, yet here we say that there is nothing missing or lacking. One could say that the things we lack are themselves the essence of creation, calling us to weave relationships with all forms of life. The gift of fruit, however, embodies an even greater sense of pure abundance and blessing than almost anything else we encounter.

We have a unique intimacy with fruit trees. In scripture that goes back to <em>Gan Eden</em> and the tree of knowing. The connection is even more powerful in the midrashic interpretation of the statement in Deuteronomy 20, <em>Ha'adam eitz ha-sadeh</em>, "A person is a tree of the field" (that is, a fruit tree). (The statement in context is really a question.) For the Kabbalah, a fruit tree is as true an image of God as a person (see below as well as the blessing from <a href="http://opensiddur.org/2010/11/pri-etz-hadar/">P'ri Eitz Hadar</a>). The Sefirot, "the Tree of Life", are thought of as a fruit tree. The reason why is that a fruit tree embodies the principle of sharing, and is a more perfect model for how God interacts with the world than human beings can be.

Why do we need to see two trees rather than just one to say the blessing? I haven't heard an explanation, but one reason is that the trees need each other to reproduce, at least on the species level (most fruits—except dates and a few others that are gendered by tree—can also fertilize themselves). The <em>halakhah</em> (religious rules) specifically forbids saying the blessing over trees that are grafted from one species onto another – there is an idea of appreciating the awesome reality of this world in itself, separate from human <em>ḥokhmas</em> (wisdom) and power.

Vanessa Paloma <a href="http://vanessapaloma.blogspot.com/2008/04/blessing-fruit-trees-in-casablanca.html">documented</a> a communal blessing over the flowering fruit trees made by the Jews of Casablanca in 2008.

<blockquote>
Today, the first morning of Ḥol HaMoed Pesaj many people in Casablanca gathered to say the blessing over the fruit trees and then we enjoyed a delicious breakfast and the sun in the garden. There were different waves of people, and as you see it was low on women! In Tangier many people have the tradition to say Birkat HaIlanot the day after the end of Pesaj (Mimouna)... and in Israel I remember we would say it before Pesaj.

The <em>Ba'al HaBait</em> told me his father had the same tradition, it's been a tradition in the family for 90 years to have this gathering on the first day of Ḥol HaMoed. When they built the house they planted the fruit trees before starting to build so that they would be able to have this gathering for the community.

Rabbi Yosef Israel told me that in Tetouan when he was growing up it was a tradition to go to someone's house that overlooked the whole city of Tetouan and spend the first day of Ḥol HaMoed in the garden and gathering as a community.
In Portugal the community in Belmonte goes out for a picnic during the days of Ḥol HaMoed as well. Ḥag HaAviv--Passover is also called the Spring Holiday--beginning to enjoy the trees, the sun and the outdoors.
