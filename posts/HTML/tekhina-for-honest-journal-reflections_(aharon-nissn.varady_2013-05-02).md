<span style="padding-left: 10em;">my ancestors who emigrated here whose journey I barely know,</span>
<span style="padding-left: 10em;">my ancestors before them whose names I do not know,</span>
that my intentions be revealed and known before me as clearly as they are before you,
that in the depths of my being,
<span style="padding-left: 5em;">thick and dark with the interconnected roots</span>[foot]Cf. Daniel 4:7-9 and Rebbe Nachman of Bratslav's many thoughts on the condition of its roots[/foot]
<span style="padding-left: 10em;">seemingly impossible to disentangle 
<span style="padding-left: 10em;">without doing violence 
<span style="padding-left: 10em;">to the organic growth of my living being,</span>
my eye remains open,
my ear remains listening,
my nose and palate sense while breathing deeply an awareness of the life that transcends my life to touch all of life,
<span style="padding-left: 5em;">through my thoughts to my actions,</span>
<span style="padding-left: 5em;">and through my actions to my thoughts,</span>
<span style="padding-left: 10em;">regardless of my transgressions,</span>
<span style="padding-left: 10em;">regardless of my holy beautiful unifications,</span>
and through this awareness bring unity to the Imagination that is Manifest 
and to the Manifestation of your Name that I imagine,
<span style="padding-left: 5em;">in peace and in lovingkindness,</span>
<span style="padding-left: 5em;">in the name of all <span class="hebrew" lang="he">יִשְׂרָאֵל</span>,</span>
<span style="padding-left: 5em;">and in the name of all your creation,</span>
<span style="padding-left: 10em;">its diverse multiplicity interconnected with desire
<span style="padding-left: 10em;">through the unique needs of every creature</span>
so as to express a Oneness parallel to a Oneness.[foot]Cf. Zohar, Parshat Terumah §163, "<a href="https://opensiddur.org/prayers-for/special-days/sabbath/kabbalat-shabbat/secret-of-oneness-mystery-of-shabbat/">k'gavneh</a>"[/foot]

May my thoughts seek truth and integrity,
the humility that is commensurate with my ignorance,
the compassion that arises from the depths of awareness,
<span style="padding-left: 5em;">as depths speak to depths,</span>[foot]cf. Psalms 42:8[/foot]&nbsp;<br />
<span style="padding-left: 10em;">through that desperation
<span style="padding-left: 10em;">that embraces even Chaos</span>
<span style="padding-left: 10em;">but which is supported by patience</span>
<span style="padding-left: 10em;">for the time permitting the resolution of Chaos
<span style="padding-left: 10em;">from Understanding to Insight.</span>

<hr/ >

This is a prayer that I wrote at Isabella Freedman Jewish Retreat Center soon after I began studying at the Davidson School of the Jewish Theological Seminary's experiential education program, back in 2011, when I began a new journal and began again a journaling practice. Whether I pray with my lips or write with my hand, my mind is searching for honesty and depth and to help myself perceive the reality of the world -- and to do so with recognition of my lack of apprehension and with empathy and encouragement to continue the effort nevertheless. I hope that in sharing this petiḥah (opening prayer), that I can help to bring recognition to journaling as a genuine practice deeply interconnected with that of crafting one's own siddur (Jewish prayer book).
