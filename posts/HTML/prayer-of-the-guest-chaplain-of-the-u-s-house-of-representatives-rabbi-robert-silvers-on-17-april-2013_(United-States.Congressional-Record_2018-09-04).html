Sponsor: Rep. Ted Deutch, (D-FL)
Date of Prayer: 04/17/2013

<blockquote>
<h3>One Minute Speech Given in Recognition of the Guest Chaplain:</h3>
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I'm proud to have the opportunity to welcome one of my constituents, Rabbi Robert Silvers , of the Congregation B'Nai Israel in Boca Raton, Florida, as he offered the opening prayer here today. He is a leader in the Jewish community in south Florida. His life epitomizes the Jewish tradition of tikkun olam––bettering the world.

Rabbi Silvers' impact is felt well beyond the 1,200 families of Congregation B'Nai Israel, with pastoral work and care that he provides not only to his own congregation but also to the greater local community as a volunteer chaplain for the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. He has served as president of the Palm Beach County Board of Rabbis and as president of the Greater Boca Raton Religious Leaders Association, an interfaith coalition of clergy. Rabbi Silvers has been involved in education and interfaith dialogue throughout south Florida.

I'm proud to call Rabbi Silvers and his wife, Ava, friends. I welcome them and all of his congregants who watched on C–SPAN as he delivered this meaningful prayer.

Eternal God, 
we children of humanity 
pray to You by many names, 
but in our hearts 
we all know You as One. 
Your unity 
creates the common bond between us 
and is our common bond with You. 
And though Your absolute truth eludes us, 
nonetheless 
we strive to be more like You 
and to carry out Your will 
for humanity: 
that we live together in peace.

Send healing of body and soul, O God, 
to the victims of this act of terror, 
to our Nation, 
and to all who grieve with them. 
Keep forever in Your loving embrace 
the souls of those who lost their lives.
