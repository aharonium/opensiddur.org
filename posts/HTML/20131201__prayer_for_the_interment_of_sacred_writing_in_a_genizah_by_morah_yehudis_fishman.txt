On the other hand, 
words that are holy-- 
that’s a very different story. 
Like the Ḥassidic Rebbe who said, 
"before you speak, 
ask yourself this question: 
‘Will your words improve the silence?’"[foot]<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=XU1LAAAAYAAJ&q=%22improve+the+silence%22&dq=%22improve+the+silence%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0wwkVZ-xOoSfNvj1g8AI&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAw">A New England adage of unknown origin</a>. But also note the tradition of appreciating silence among the Ḥasidim of Worke, as described by Elie Wiesel in <em>Somewhere a Master: Further Hasidic Portraits and Legends</em> (New York: Summit Books, 1982), pp.175[/foot]

If these pages of Tefillah and Torah, 
of prayer and teachings, 
have been washed away 
from our homes and shuls, 
where DO we find the words 
to improve the silence? 
I doubt it will come 
through mere ego driven words.

Perhaps you claim

in the depths of our own souls?

In that case, like the words of King Solomon,[foot]Cf. 1 Kings 3:9[/foot]&nbsp; 
we ask that G-d grant us ‘<em>Lev Shomei’a</em>,’ 
a heart that hears through the silence, 
a heart that hears behind the cry of each dying letter, 
your insistence on an emergent reality 
beyond the borders of our sensory world.

Therefore, I call out to you, 
sweet pages, 
and sadly tattered sheets, 
you who lie forlorn 
but not forgotten 
in the dark, dank, depths 
of your now subterranean library. 
I send back to you 
the luminous angels 
that we together birthed 
from our most intimate moments-- 
when, as Rebbe Nachman put it, 
we formed bouquets 
from each hallowed letter, 
each blessed phrase.

May your words never expire, but rather -- 
arise and inspire from their hidden tombs 
to enter a realm where they await 
a baal hasadeh, 
a master of the field, 
a Mashiach, -- 
a shining doula of speech, 
a conductor with a baton 
that can again blow life, 
hope 
and healing 
back into pages and souls, 
back into an earth 
where trees and plants 
will once again rejoice 
with a new song 
in a rejuvenated creation.
