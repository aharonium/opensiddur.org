<blockquote>
<h3>One Minute Speech Given in Recognition of the Guest Chaplain:</h3>

Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor my good friend, Rabbi Claudio J. Kogan.

Rabbi Kogan has devoted his life to being a spiritual leader in the Jewish faith and a leader in our community.

Rabbi Kogan is currently the director of the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley School of Medicine's new Institute for Bioethics and Social Justice. Since June 2018, Rabbi Kogan has led the School of Medicine's efforts on ethical and social issues that affect south Texas and the Nation.

Rabbi Kogan is a physician and an ordained rabbi. He earned his medical degree from the University of Buenos Aires School of Medicine and a master's of bioethics from the University of Pennsylvania.

Rabbi Kogan has also spent time as a member of the Institutional Review Board at the Yale University School of Medicine.

Previously, he served as rabbi at Temple Emanuel in my district in McAllen, Texas, and continues to serve as a chaplain for various law enforcement agencies and hospital systems in the area.

Madam Speaker, it is my honor to have Rabbi Kogan and his family join us here today in the people's House.
