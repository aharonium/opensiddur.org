How does rabbinic Judaism value openness? What does openness mean? This sourcesheet accompanied the shiur "'Make yourself into a Maqom Hefker': Rabbinic Teachings on Open Source in Judaism," a class I taught on Taz biShvat 5774 (January 16th, 2013) in partnership with the <a href="http://sefaria.org">Sefaria Project</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitro_(parsha)">Parshat Yitro</a>.

The shiur discussed the concept of <span class="hebrew">דִּימוּס פַּרְהֶסְיַא</span> Dimus Parrhesia (δῆμος παρρησία) as a valued ideal in Rabbinic discourse: its cameo appearance in midrashic teachings on Parshat Yitro and its relationship to other relevant ideas and attitudes in the study of Torah and the Jewish stewardship of the Commons.

<blockquote>דִּימוּס פַּרְהֶסְיא (<em>dimus</em>) –  openly, from דִּימוֺסיַא (<em>dimosia</em>) δημόσια, translated in Latin <em>coram publica</em> –  in the public eye, i.e. open to the public[foot]Many thanks to Dr. Daniel Sperber for his explanation of this in correspondence. He writes, “in Mechilta to Exod. 19:2, ed. Horowitz-Rabin p.205 lines 17-18, [דִּימוּס] is short for דימוסיא found frequently in rabbinic literature. It is the Greek word δημόσια translated coram publica, in the public eye, i.e. open to the public, a meaning found in Sylloge lnscriptionum Graecum, 2nd edition, ed. Diltenberger 1888-1901, no.807, an inscription from after 138 C. E. פרהסיא is merely a gloss to דימוס to explain the word and its meaning, as noted by the editor of the Mechilta.”[/foot]) and (gk. παρρησία, <em><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/parrhesia">parrhesia</a></em>) – boldness or freedom in speech
