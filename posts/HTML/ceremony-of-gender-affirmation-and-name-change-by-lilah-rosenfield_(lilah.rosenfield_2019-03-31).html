Title: Ceremony of Gender Affirmation and Name Change, by Lilah Rosenfield<br />

<div class="english" style="font-size: 1.2em;">
I put together this ceremony for myself with support from my Cantor and my parents, and as such was gearing it to my experiences as a Jewish trans woman. I've [bracketed] pronouns and other options (choices are denoted with a slash, additive options with a bar), but your mileage may vary regardless of your gender. Think of this as a starting point and modify it as you see fit.

I've tried to make the ceremony as inclusive as possible to different kinds of families, but it is a ceremony which requires some sort of Jewish teacher/mentor/parent (who’s accepting of you, obviously) to bestow the name upon you. If you don't have that kind of figure in your life, you may or may not find this ceremony template helpful.

Finally, I personally chose to alternate between the feminine and masculine Hebrew for God, and I've maintained my original layout but you should feel free to swap the Names as you see fit, either by switching to all one gender or by making the body and will blessings masculine, and the rest feminine.

This ceremony was remarkably meaningful to me. I hope others find the same spiritual joy in it that I did.

Rabbi Kukla writes, "This blessing takes the same form and grammatical structure as classical blessings that mark wondrous occasions. “The Transforming One” as a name for God appears in the traditional blessings of gratitude that are recited each morning. The Hebrew verb root of this word, avar, has multiple layers of meaning within Judaism. Most literally it means to physically cross over, however it also implies spiritual transformation in High Holiday prayers. It lies at the root of the word Ivrim, Hebrew people. We are the Ivrim, the crossing over people, because we physically crossed over the Jordan River to escape from slavery and oppression and spiritually transformed ourselves. At its core, our ancestral sacred memory holds this moment of painful and yet redemptive, physical and spiritual transition. In Modern Hebrew, this same verb root is used to form the word, ma’avar, which means to transition genders."[/foot]

Rabbi Kukla writes, "The second blessing is also taken from morning liturgy. It is based on the book of Genesis, which teaches that male and female bodies were equally created in God’s image. The Midrash, classical Jewish exegesis, adds that the Adam HaRishon, the first human being formed in God’s likeness, was an androgynos, an intersex person. Hence our tradition teaches that all
bodies and genders are created in God’s image whether we identify as men, women, intersex or something else. When we take physical or spiritual steps to more honestly manifest our gender identities we are fulfilling the foundational mitzvah, religious commandment, to be partnered with God in completing the work of creation."[/foot]

We have added Hebrew corresponding with the romanized transliteration. We have added the priestly blessing for non-binary persons as adapted by the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wyVUFqTsaMcQMB0T_voRmbIyuvDBKHwJfo6dfGk6VuE/edit">non-binary Hebrew project</a>. The blessings for changing genders was offered by Rabbi Eli Kukla in "<a href="http://transtorah.org/PDFs/Blessing_for_Transitioning_Genders.pdf">A Blessing for Transitioning Genders</a>" (TransTorah 2006) in transliteration to which we have added vocalized Hebrew. --Aharon N.
