Public worship is an act of the highest importance. However, it tends in our days to become a spectacle, in which the congregation remains passive, inert spectators. But prayer is action; it requires complete mobilization of heart, mind, and soul. What is the worth of attending public worship when mind and soul are not involved? Renewal of liturgy involves renewal of prayer.

There is, in addition, a malady indigenous or congenital to liturgy. Liturgy as an act of prayer is an outcome and distillation of the inner life. Although its purpose is to exalt the life which engenders it, it harbors a tendency to follow a direction and rhythm of its own, independent of and divorced from the energies of life which brought prayer into being. At the beginning, liturgy is intimately related to the life which calls it into being. But as liturgy unfolds, it enters a state of stubborn disconnection, even into a state of opposition. Liturgy is bound to become rigid, to stand by itself, and to take on a measure of imperviousness. It tends to become timeless, transpersonal; liturgy for the sake of liturgy. Personal presence is replaced by mere attendance; instead of erecting a sanctuary of time in the realm of the soul, liturgy attracts masses of people to a sanctuary in the realm of space.

I do not wish to set up a dichotomy of prayer and liturgy. This would contradict the spirit of devotion. I merely wish to concentrate my thoughts on prayer as a personal affair, as an act of supreme importance. I plead for the primacy of prayer in our inner existence. The test of authentic theology is the degree to which it reflects and enhances the power of prayer, the way of worship.

In antiquity as well as in the Middle Ages, due to the scarcity of parchment, people would often write new texts on top of earlier written parchments. The term denoting such writings is palimpsest. Metaphorically, I suggest that authentic theology is a palimpsest: scholarly, disciplined thinking grafted upon prayer.

Prayer is either exceedingly urgent, exceedingly relevant, or inane and useless. Our first task is to learn to comprehend why prayer is an ontological necessity. God is hiding, and man is defying. Every moment God is creating and self-concealing. Prayer is disclosing or at least preventing irreversible concealing. God is ensconced in mystery, hidden in the depths. Prayer is pleading with God to come out of the depths. “Out of the depths have I called Thee, O Lord” (Psalms 130:1).

We have lost sensitivity to truth and purity of heart in the wasteland of opportunism. It is, however, a loss that rebounds to afflict us with anguish. Such anguish, when converted into prayer, into a prayer for truth, may evoke the dawn of God. Our agony over God’s concealment is sharing in redeeming God’s agony over man’s concealment.

Prayer as an episode, as a cursory incident, will not establish a home in the land of oblivion. Prayer must pervade as a climate of living, and all our acts must be carried out as variations on the theme of prayer. A deed of charity, an act of kindness, a ritual moment—each is prayer in the form of a deed. Such prayer involves a minimum or even absence of outwardness, and an abundance of inwardness.

Prayer is not a stratagem for occasional use, a refuge to resort to now and then. It is rather like an established residence for the innermost self. All things have a home, the bird has a nest, the fox has a hole, the bee has a hive. A soul without prayer is a soul without a home. Weary, sobbing, the soul, after roaming through a world festered with aimlessness, falsehoods and absurdities, seeks a moment in which to gather up its scattered life, in which to divest itself of enforced pretensions and camouflage, in which to simplify complexities, in which to call for help without being a coward. Such a home is prayer. Continuity, permanence, intimacy, authenticity, earnestness are its attributes. For the soul, home is where prayer is.

To understand the world I must love my home. It is difficult to perceive luminosity anywhere if there is no fight in my own home.

Prayer is more than paying attention to the holy. Prayer comes about as an event. It consists of two inner acts: an act of turning and an act of direction.

God is beyond the reach of finite notions, diametrically opposed to our power of comprehension. In theory He seems to be neither here nor now. He is so far away, an outcast, a refugee in His own world. It is as if all doors were closed to Him. To pray is to open a door, where both God and soul may enter. Prayer is arrival, for Him and for us. To pray is to overcome distance, to shatter screens, to render obliquities straight, to heal the break between God and the world. A dreadful oblivion prevails in the world. The world has forgotten what it means to be human. The gap is widening, the abyss is within the self.

Human distress, wretchedness, agony, is a signal of a universal distress. It is a sign of human misery; it also proclaims a divine predicament.

A great mystery has become a reality in our own days, as God’s response to a people’s prayer. After nearly two thousand years the city of David, the city of Jerusalem, is now restored to the people of Israel. This marvellous event proclaims a call for the renewal of worship, for the revival of prayer. We did not enter the city of Jerusalem on our own in 1967. Streams of endless craving, endless praying, clinging, dreaming, day and night, midnights, years, decades, centuries, millenia, streams of tears, pledging, waiting—from all over the world, from all comers of the earth, carried us of this generation to the Wall, to the city of Jerusalem.

Prayer must not be dissonant with the rest of living. The mercifulness, gentleness, which pervades us in moments of prayer is but a ruse or a bluff, if it is inconsistent with the way we live at other moments. The divorce of liturgy and living, of prayer and practice, is more than a scandal; it is a disaster. A word uttered in prayer is a promise, an earnest, a commitment. If the promise is not kept, we are guilty of violating a promise. A liturgical revival cannot come about in isolation. Worship is the quintessence of living. Perversion or suppression of the sensibilities that constitute being human will convert worship into a farce. What is handicapping prayer is not the antiquity of the Psalms but our own crudity and spiritual immaturity.

The beginning of prayer is praise. The power of worship is song. First we sing, then we understand. First we praise, then we believe. Praise and song open eyes to the grandeur of reality that transcends the self. Song restores the soul; praise repairs spiritual deficiency.

To praise is to make Him present to our minds, to our hearts, to vivify the understanding that beyond all questions, protests, and pain at God’s dreadful silence, is His mercy and humility. We are stunned when we try to think of His essence; we are exalted when intuiting His presence. While it is true that being human is verified in relations between man and man, depth and authenticity of existence are disclosed in moments of worship.

Worship is more than paying homage. To worship is to join the cosmos in praising God. The whole cosmos, every living being sings, the Psalmists insist. Neither joy nor sorrow but song is the ground-plan of being. It is the quintessence of life. To praise is to call forth the promise and presence of the divine. We live for the sake of a song. We praise for the privilege of being. Worship is the climax of living. There is no knowledge without love, no truth without praise. At the beginning was the song, and praise is man’s response to the never-ending beginning.

“Choose life!” is the great legacy of the Hebrew Bible, and the cult of life is affirmed in contemporary theology. However, life is not a tiling, static and final. Life means living, and in living you have to choose a road, direction, goals. Pragmatists who believe that life itself can provide us with the criteria for truth overlook the fact that forces of suicide and destruction are also inherent in life.

Religion is critique of all satisfaction. Its end is joy, but its beginning is discontent, detesting boasts, smashing idols. It began in Ur Kasdim, in the seat of a magnificent civilization.

This is the text of "On Prayer" as published in <em>Conservative Judaism</em>, v.25 n.1 Fall 1970, p.1-12. Rabbi Dr. Abraham Joshua Heschel delivered this speech at an inter-religious convocation held under the auspices of the U.S. Liturgical Conference in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on August 28, 1969. In <em>Spiritual Radical: Abraham Joshua Heschel in America, 1940-1972</em> (Yale University Press 2007, p. 339-340), Edward K. Kaplan writes:

<blockquote>Late in August 1969, Heschel was the sole Jew among leading Protestants and Catholics to address a mass meeting of the National Liturgical Conference (an unofficial Catholic organization) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The audience was composed of progressive Catholics, most of them young. The agenda called for a fusion of inwardness and action: political change, social justice, and the virtues of prayer. The theme, as described by Robert McAfee Brown in Ins opening address, was that hope must emerge from dissent. Former senator Wayne Morse urged participants to launch a “religious crusade” against the Vietnam War. Andrew Young of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference spoke of “hope in the quest for economic justice” and the revolutionary power of the Gospels.[foot]The conference took place on 25–28 August 1969. Some 2,500 people attended the opening session at the Milwaukee Arena, which ended with a multimedia extravaganza, a liturgical dance, and a mass set to rock music. See L. I. Steli, “The Road Show of Hope,” <em>Tempo</em>, (15 October 1969), 3; <em>Catholic Herald Citizen</em> (29 March 1969), and articles by Ethel Gintoft, “Speaker [Robert McAfee Brown] Defines Meaning of Liturgy as ‘Work People Do,’ ” <em>Catholic Herald Citizen</em> (30 August 1969), and “Rabbi Reminds Conference of Need for Prayer Along with Activity,” <em>Catholic Herald Citizen</em> (6 September 1969). Robert McAfee Brown, “Backdrop for Hope,” <em>Tempo</em> (15 October 1969), 7.[/foot]

The press paid special attention to Heschel. Before the event, he was reported to have criticized repressive tendencies within the Catholic Church, defending activists such as Archbishop James Shannon, “who recently resigned because of conservative pressure against his questioning of the War, Papal authority and the pill ban.” At the same time, Heschel pleaded “that reformers not throw out positive religious traditions, such as reserving time for daily prayer.” In his address, Heschel offered “hope in the midst of alienation, chaos, and destruction." How could this be found? Through prayer.[foot]Steli, “Road Show of Hope,” 3; Gintoft, “Rabbi Reminds Conference of Need for Prayer.” Heschel’s speech was excerpted in <em>Tempo</em> (15 October 1969), 8, 11. The most complete version, “On Prayer,” appeared in <em>Conservative Judaism</em> 25, 1 (fall 1970), 1–12, from which I quote.[/foot]

In rhythmical cadences, Hesehel demonstrated that prayer was a sanctuary for the “weary, sobbing soul," as he continued: “How marvelous is my home. I enter as a suppliant and emerge as a witness; I enter as a stranger and emerge as next of kin.” Prayer was a cosmic drama, with human beings responsible for redeeming the divine: “I pray because God, the Shekhinah, is an outcast. I pray because God is in exile, because we all conspire to blur all signs of His presence in the present or in the past. I pray because I refuse to despair. . . . I pray because I am unable to pray.”[foot]Heschel 1970, “On Prayer,” 2–3, 4.[/foot]

The focus on prayer even explained his political dissent: “Religion as an establishment must remain separated from the government. Yet prayer as a voice of mercy, as a cry for justice, as a plea for gentleness, must not be kept apart." Religious observance braces us to reject the status quo, even if it means toppling the authorities: “Prayer is meaningless unless it is subversive, unless it seeks to overthrow and to ruin the pyramids of callousness, hatred, opportunism, falsehoods. The liturgical movement must become a revolutionary movement, seeking to overthrow the forces that continue to destroy the promise, the hope, the vision." Thrilled at Heschel’s “terse, proverbial insights,” the audience gave him a standing ovation.</blockquote>
