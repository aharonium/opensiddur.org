<hr />

This Yom Kipur, our congregation (<a href="https://www.bethjacobsynagogue.ca">Beth Jacob Synagogue in Hamilton</a>) requested a reworking of the piyyut, "Amits Koaḥ" (text, <a href="https://www.hadar.org/tefillah-element/y-av-amitz-koach">audio</a>) since the language is very tough and resists plain translation into English. I was also commissioned to write a poem describing the history of the world from a Jewish perspective, from scratch and in English, for use at the beginning of the Avodah service. It turned out to be just as obscure as the original so I put in a little column to the right with a little reference what I was talking about.
