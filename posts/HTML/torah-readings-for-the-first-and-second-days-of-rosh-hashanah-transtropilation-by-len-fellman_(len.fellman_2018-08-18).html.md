This is an English translation of the Torah readings for Rosh Hashanah, transtropilized (a term coined by Fellman to describe texts where the Masoretic cantillation has been applied to the translation). This translation is based on Everett Fox THE FIVE BOOKS OF MOSES with modifications based on the following translations: Aryeh Kaplan’s LIVING TORAH, The Stone Edition Tanach, the Artscroll machzors, Gunther Plaut THE TORAH – A Modern Commentary.
