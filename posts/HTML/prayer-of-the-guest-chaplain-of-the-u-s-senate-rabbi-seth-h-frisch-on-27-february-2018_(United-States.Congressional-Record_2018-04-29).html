We stand before You on the eve of the Biblical Festival of Purim, 
a joyous time in which we read from the ancient and sacred scroll of the Book of Esther. 
It is in the scroll we read at first of a certain darkness, 
a darkness which would come to envelope the entire nation over which Esther would soon reign as Queen.

It was Queen Esther who became frightened 
when the plan revealing a plot to erase the sacred remnants of her people, 
along with the fundamental teachings of her faith, 
came to light; 
and yet it was Esther, who, 
when confronted by the impending darkness, 
was able to bring the plot to an end, 
allowing her people to emerge from the shadow of darkness--
of this horror--
and live freely, 
without fear, 
celebrating life itself 
in the light of their newfound freedom.

And now, standing here today, before You, 
on the eve of this festival, 
we, too, ask that You remember us for life, 
instilling within us a greater love of freedom, 
seeking both peace and prosperity 
for all the inhabitants of this great Nation.

allowing all of us--

a life of freedom without fear, 
worshiping as we choose, 
and continuing to bask in that greater love 
which You shed 
and allow us to live within.
