<blockquote>
<h3>One Minute Speech Given in Recognition of the Guest Chaplain:</h3>
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome to the U.S. House of Representatives my dear friend and my adopted rabbi, David–Seth Kirshner, the leader of Temple Emanu–El in my congressional district in Closter, New Jersey.

As a lifelong New Jersey resident, Rabbi Kirshner has dedicated his career to serving his family, community, and our country. Dori and David are proud and loving parents to Eve and Elias, and I am glad they are here. Rabbi Kirshner is a spiritual mentor to many and a man of deep faith, conviction, and conscience.

Temple Emanu–El has been a beacon of civic engagement, youth education, and community service in our State, and under Rabbi Kirshner's leadership, Temple Emanu–El has brought a warm and open atmosphere that will endure for generations to come, building on its 85–year history of service to our State.

Rabbi Kirshner and Temple Emanu–El call on each of us to do our part to engage in "repair of the world," "tikkun olam," to love your neighbor as yourself, and to fulfill God's commandments with the work of our hands.

In addition to his work as rabbi of Temple Emanu–El, Rabbi Kirshner is a leader among his colleagues, serving as the vice president of the New Jersey Board of Rabbis and as a member of the Chancellor's Rabbinic Cabinet at the Jewish Theological Seminary.

A strong advocate for the U.S.–Israel relationship, Rabbi Kirshner is on the New Jersey–Israel Commission. He is a believer that Israel is a key strategic ally and a defender of democracy and freedom against the evils of terror.

I would like to thank Rabbi Kirshner for praying with us today and representing all faiths of the Fifth Congressional District of New Jersey.
May God continue to bless the United States of America.
