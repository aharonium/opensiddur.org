Guest Chaplain: Rabbi Stephen Roth, Congregation Eitz Chaim, Passaic, NJ
Sponsor: Rep. Bill Pascrell, (D-NJ)
Date of Prayer: 05/29/2014

<blockquote>
<h3>One Minute Speech Given in Recognition of the Guest Chaplain:</h3>
Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to thank my friend, Rabbi Stephen Roth, a resident of the Ninth Congressional District of New Jersey, for offering the opening prayer before the House of Representatives.

Rabbi Roth hails from Brooklyn, New York City, and was ordained in 1972 by the Brooklyn Rabbinical Seminary. For 20 years, he served as the founding rabbi of Congregation Eitz Chaim in Passaic, New Jersey, inspiring and guiding countless members of his congregation.

In addition to his work as a teacher, mentor, and counselor in his community, Rabbi Roth also served as the softball coach for the Torah Academy of Bergen County, as well as the Kushner Yeshiva High School. Rabbi Roth has, no doubt, served his community so well, thanks to the loving support of his wife of nearly 35 years, Fern, who is with us today, as well as his three children and 13 grandchildren.

So on behalf of the United States Congress and my constituents in New Jersey, I want to thank my friend Rabbi Roth for serving as guest chaplain in the House of Representatives today.

This past week, 
we observed Memorial Day, 
a day set aside 
to remember those who gave their lives 
in defense of our great land 
and the freedoms that we enjoy. 
Let us remember 
that there are many people in the world 
that still do not enjoy these freedoms. 
We ask 
that these as yet oppressed people 
be granted the same freedoms we enjoy 
as a free nation, 
speedily in our time.
