Rabbi Arik Ascherman of <a href="http://www.rhr-na.org/">Rabbis for Human Rights</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">shares</a> a prayer he wrote following the Israel Land Administration's most recent eviction and demolition of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Araqeeb">El-Arakib</a>, a Bedouin village in the Negev. The prayer was written with the intention that its recitation is made "on behalf of justice and the rededication of Israel to the ideals of her <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Declaration_of_Independence_%28Israel%29">Declaration of Independence</a>." Rabbi Ashcerman writes:

<blockquote>Please take two small steps this weekend (and in the coming weeks) on behalf of justice and the rededication of Israel to the ideals of her <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Declaration_of_Independence_%28Israel%29">Declaration of Independence</a>. See [above] the prayer that we are asking you to read in your congregation/place of worship.

As Americans celebrate Thanksgiving weekend and Jews around the world prepare for the joyous and thankful holiday of Ḥanukkah next week, there is no cause for joy or thanksgiving in the Negev Bedouin Village of El-Arakib. The entire village, sitting on lands in the possession of the El-Turi tribe for tens of years before the State of Israel, was demolished this week for the 7th time because it is "unrecognized," and in the way of approaching JNF forests being planted on tribal lands. Even though the claims of the El-Turi tribe are now before the court, a village not on the map can not possibly get permits to build legally.

In Parashat Va'Yeshev we read the awful story of how Joseph is sold by his brothers. Perhaps the essence of human rights work is that all humanity are brothers and sisters, and that we must prevent one human being from selling another in any way. When we abandon the weakest and poorest Israelis, leaving them without home or a safety net, we have sold them. When we allow violence against women, we have sold them. We sell out our citizens when we allow corporations to make huge profits from our natural resources such as Israel's undersea natural gas reserves, instead of using those profits for the benefit of our society. When we deny Palestinians the right to water or access to their lands or a roof over their heads, we have sold them into despair and oppression.

<em>Nafal d'dvar b'Yisrael</em>. This week the unrecognized Negev Bedouin village El-Arakib was demolished for the seventh time. My heart cries for them, and we need to reflect on how we have betrayed our fellow Israeli citizens. This is a community that has existed for dozens of years, before the founding of Israel. Their case is in court. The intent appears to preempt the court and to be to wipe out any memory that it existed, as three JNF forests are closing in on in from all sides.

As a partner in "The Recognition Forum" and "Negev Coexistence Forum" working on behalf of the unrecognized villages, we were asked to write the prayer which appears below for use this weekend in synagogues, churches, mosques, and other places of worship in Israel and around the world. If you are a congregational rabbi or lead a congregation of any faith, please include this prayer in your worship this weekend and/or on one of the coming weekends.

If you are a lay person or non-congregational rabbi/spiritual leader, please ask that this prayer be read in your congregation/place of worship. Please notify us at info@rhr.israel.net if you recited this prayer and tell us about the experience, as it is very important to us to know in how many places it was read and what happened. Next week, we in Israel will hold an interfaith prayer at El-Arakib, and it would be great to announce how many congregations around the world remembered El-Arakib in their prayers.

You can also <a href="http://www.change.org/petitions/view/equal_rights_sustainability_and_development_for_israels_negev_not_dispossession_of_the_bedouin">click here</a> to sign a petition on the Jewish National Fund asking them to cease efforts to plant forests on the ruins of Bedouin villages and to include the Bedouin in their plans for developing the Negev.

As we celebrate on Ḥanukkah the rededication of the Temple which once stood in Jerusalem, let us light a candle of justice and rededicate ourselves to the dream ensconced in our Declaration of Independence of an Israel "Based on freedom, justice and peace as envisaged by the prophets of Israel " that will "Ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or gender."
