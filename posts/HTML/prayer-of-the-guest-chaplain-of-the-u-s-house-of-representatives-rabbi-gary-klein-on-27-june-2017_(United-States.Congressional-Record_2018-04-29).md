<blockquote>
<h3>One Minute Speech Given in Recognition of the Guest Chaplain:</h3>
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome my great friend, Rabbi Gary Klein, who has led the Temple Ahavat Shalom of Palm Harbor, Florida, for the past 30 years.

Temple Ahavat Shalom is a congregation that serves nearly 500 households in my district. Since coming to Pinellas County in 1987, he served on the board of the St. Leo University Center for Catholic–Jewish studies and currently serves on the National Council of AIPAC.

Rabbi Klein is a long–time advocate on behalf of the U.S.–Israel alliance.

As co–chair of the Congressional Hellenic Israeli Alliance, I welcome his continued advice and counsel, especially as it relates to security in the Eastern Mediterranean.

For several years now, I have joined Rabbi Klein and the congregation for Passover Seder, and I very much look forward to continuing this tradition.

I am thankful for his friendship, and I wish him many more years of blessed leadership.

Religious traditions teach 
that people and God are to work together 
to create a better world. 
Therefore, 
as we begin this day of work of the House of Representatives, 
we pray first, O God, 
that You join with medical professionals 
to help Congressman Scalise 
and others injured with him 
experience complete recoveries.

You have also taught us through the Talmud,

even if you do not complete the task, 
is life's most sacred duty.[foot]A paraphrase of Rabbi Tarfon's maxim in Pirkei Avot 2:16[/foot]
Help us and our legislators 
to also understand the Talmudic concept 
that reinforces this when it states: 
If you save a single life, 
it is as if you saved the entire world.[foot]Cf. Mishnah Sanhedrin 4:5[/foot]
