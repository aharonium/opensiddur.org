Our research of the <a href="http://collections.stanford.edu/copyrightrenewals/">copyright renewals database</a> held at Stanford Universtiy indicates that this work is in the Public Domain due to a lapse of copyright due to the lack of a copyright renewal. <em>Ha-Madrikh</em>, having been published in the United States between 1923 and 1963, was required to have its copyright renewed within 28 years of its publication by the copyright holder indicated in the copyright notice: the Hebrew Publishing Company. This is a common condition for many works published during this period. We have digitally scanned this work so as to make it more widely accessible and to make it available for digital transcription.

<h3>Introduction</h3>

This manual has been devised for the express purpose of giving the Rabbi, or anyone officiating at a Jewish ceremonial or ritual, a concise and practical aid that will facilitate the task of officiating , and will obviate the necessity of resorting to the voluminous literature pertaining thereto. 

The prayers and texts used for recitations on various occasions are given in their entirety so that there is no need during a ritual to scan the book in order to complete a particular service: the instructions are given in chronological sequence, and the prayers and texts for recitation follow the instructions. The Midrashic and Talmudic excerpts given at the end of the volume bear upon the subjects covered in the book and are intended to serve as source material, for sermons and speeches for special occasions. 

The references indicating the sources will be of interest to those wishing further elucidation or information. 

The need for a practical manual of this sort has been long felt, and we are confident that this volume will accomplish the purpose for which it is intended.
