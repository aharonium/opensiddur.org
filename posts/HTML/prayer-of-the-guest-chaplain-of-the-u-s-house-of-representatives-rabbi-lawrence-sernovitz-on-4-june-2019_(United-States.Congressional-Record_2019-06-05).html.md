<blockquote>
<h3>One Minute Speech Given in Recognition of the Guest Chaplain:</h3>

Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, I am delighted to welcome to this Chamber my close friend, Rabbi Larry Sernovitz, whom we have just heard offer us a beautiful, wise prayer.

I first met Rabbi Sernovitz in Abington, in my home district, where he served Temple–Beth Am. When I was first elected to public office as a township commissioner, it was Larry, it was the rabbi, who offered a powerful benediction that evening on the importance of education, social justice, humility, and courage. Larry has been a close friend and counselor ever since.

Through Larry's rabbinical work, he has lifted his devotion to community, faith, and family. Larry lives the creed, "Love the stranger."

As a founder of Nafshenu in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, he seeks to create a community that places people and their hopes and their dreams first.

Most importantly, Larry is a dedicated husband to Rebecca and a loving, steady dad to Sam, Daniella, and Eden, who join him today.

It brings me great joy to welcome my good friend Rabbi Larry Sernovitz and thank him for his wise prayer.
