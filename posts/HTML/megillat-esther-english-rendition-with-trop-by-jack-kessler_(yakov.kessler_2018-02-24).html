Our Jewish heritage is a rich treasury of the accumulated wisdom (and wit) of the many centuries of our remarkable history. One of the greatest challenges facing the contemporary Jewish community outside Israel is that of making this heritage accessible, in light of the language barrier posed by classical Hebrew.

A successful formula employed by a growing number of congregations and ḥavurot is the singing of Biblical texts - Torah, Haftarot, and Megillot - in English which has been set to Trop, the ancient melodic chant system for these texts. For many, this is an ideal way to communicate the meaning of the Hebrew text.
