            "bio": "Angie Irma Cohon (née Reinhart, 1890-1991) was a Jewish author, poet, translator, and educator. Born to parents J.F. and Amelia (Marks) Reinhart in 1890, Cohon lived in Portland, Oregon until moving to Ohio at 19 to attend Hebrew Union College. She transferred to the University of Cincinnati, earning a bachelors degree in 1912. On June 12 of the same year she graduated, Cohon married Rabbi Samuel S. Cohon. In Chicago, they ran Temple Mizpah, with A. Irma Cohon organizing the sisterhood (Women of Mizpah) and the synagogue's religious school. A prayer pamphlet she prepared, <em>A Brief Jewish Ritual</em>, was published by Women of Mizpah in 1921. Cohon is best known for her contributions to the field of Jewish music in the English language. The National Council on Jewish Women published <em>Introduction to Jewish Music in Eight Illustrated Lectures</em>, with a second edition coming out in 1923. This work became a basis for the Council's study of music for nearly 30 years. She collaborated with Abraham Zevi Idelsohn on <em>Harvest Festivals, A Children’s Succoth Celebration</em> (1925).",

(Her husband, Rabbi Samuel S. Cohon, was the spiritual leader of the Temple.) The name is derived from the place name given in Genesis 31 in the context of Yaaqov leaving the settlement of Lavan, with Lavan recognizing the independence of his daughters in Genesis 31:43. Other Jewish women's sisterhoods have used this name including at Hebrew Union College, in Cincinnati, Ohio.",
