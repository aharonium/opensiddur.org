            "bio": "Rabbi Joseph Leonard Levy (1865-1917), born in London, was a Liberal/Reform movement rabbi in the United Kingdom and the United States. He was educated at Jews' College and University College (B.A.), London, at Bristol University, England, and at Western University of Pennsylvania (D.D.). Rabbi Levy was rabbi of the Bristol Hebrew Congregation (1885-1889) and of Bnai Israel Congregation, Sacramento, California (1889-1893); associate rabbi of the Keneseth Israel Congregation, Philadelphia (1893-1901); and, since 1901, has been rabbi of the Rodeph Shalom congregation, Pittsburg. In 1898 he was elected chaplain of \"Keegan's Brigade,\" with which he served through the Spanish-American war. Levy was the organizer of a number of charitable and religious societies among the Jews of Philadelphia. He is the author of a translation of the tractate Rosh haShanah of the Babylonian Talmud (Philadelphia, 1895). He published also <em>The Greater Lights</em> (1895); <em>Home Service for the Passover</em> (1896); <em>The Nineteenth Century</em> (1901); <em>A Book of Prayer</em> (Pittsburg, 1902); <em>The Jew's Beliefs</em> (1903); <em>The Children's Service and Hymnal</em> (1903); <em>Text-Book of Religion and Ethics for Jewish Children</em> (1903); <em>Sabbath Reading</em> (1904); and eight volumes of Sunday lectures. Levy is the editor of the <em>Jewish Criterion</em>, published at Pittsburg.",

It has been used from week to week for some months past, the services and addresses having first appeared in leaflet form.</p>\n<p>The four services are arranged for the four Sundays of the month. If the month has five Sundays, the fourth service is read on the fifth Sunday. The four services are arranged in Biblical language, as far as possible, and aim to impress the children with ideas on (1) Love; (2) Duty; (3) Blessing and Curse; (4) Israel. At the close of the service an address, or Supplementary Service, is read by the person in charge of the meeting.</p>\n<p>The portions assigned to Teachers and Pupils can be disposed of in another manner, if others see fit to make use of this little handbook. School Directors may take the place of Teachers, and Teachers may take the place of the Pupils and vice versa. The writer’s aim is to keep interest awakened and to give the children a part of the service. The Supplementary Service may be read, paragraph by paragraph, by the children of the advanced classes, when they are sufficiently familiar with the text. The musical settings of the Hymns at the end of the book have been carefully selected and include some so-called traditional melodies such as Jigdal, En Kelohenu, ’Hanukkah, etc.</p>\n<p>The book may prove of some use in families desiring to hold a brief weekly service in the home. The father could take the place of the Superintendent, the mother, of the Teacher, the children, of the Pupils. We hope that this booklet may serve to develop religious and ethical sentiments in the children using it. </p>\n<p>J. Leonard Levy<br />\nPittsburgh, December 31st, 1902.\n</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\nPREFACE TO SECOND EDITION.</p>\n<p>The first edition of five thousand copies being exhausted, I have issued this second edition because of a constant demand for extra copies of this book. I have added Services 12-20, and a number of hymns. I hope that the little volume may be as useful as the letters received from scores of Rabbis, teachers and parents assure me the first edition has been. </p>\n<p>J. Leonard Levy<br />\nPittsburgh, August 7th, 1904.\n</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS.</p>\n<p>In this little hymnal I have selected but a few tuneful melodies from the large number of collections of hymns consulted. Thousands upon thousands of hymns were carefully considered, with the foregoing result. I hope that, in due time, the melodies will be learned and that congregational singing may be an established feature in the congregation for whose children this work has, primarily, been written and arranged.</p>\n<p>Wherever possible I obtained permission of authors and publishers to use words and settings. In this connection I beg to record my grateful appreciation of the courtesy extended, among others, by Mrs. T. C. Williams, Mrs. Frances E. Foote, Rev. Dr. Minot J. Savage, Professor Felix Adler, Rev. Dr. A.P. Putnam, Professor Mauritz Leefson, Rev. Dr. C.W. Wendte, Rev. Dr. B.A. Elzas, Mr. George H. Ellis, and the publishers of “Songs and Singers of the Liberal Faith,” “Jubilate Deo,” “Amore Dei,” “The University Hymn Book,” “Songs of the Church Universal,” “A Book of Song and Service,” etc. If I have omitted the names of any of those whose work has proved so serviceable to me in preparing this modest hymnal, I trust they will pardon the oversight while accepting the assurance of my gratitude.</p>\n<p>In the arrangement of the tunes I was fortunate enough to have the valuable assistance of Mr. W.K. Steiner, who gave me the benefit of his extensive musical knowledge. In most cases he re-arranged the musical settings, and the beautiful harmonization, which will be found to be a characteristic of this little collection, is almost altogether his work. In company with all who will make frequent use of these hymns, I desire to thank him for his generous and able assistance. In conclusion I wish to thank the members and children of Congregation Rodeph Shalom, without whose generous and loyal help this modest volume would, probably, never have been published.</p>\n<p>J. Leonard Levy.<br />\nPittsburg, Pa.\n</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\n[HYMNS]</p>\n<p>John Quincy Adams, &#8220;God&#8217;s Omnipresence,&#8221; 178<br />\nFelix Adler, &#8220;The City of the Light,&#8221; 152<br />\nAncient Ritual, &#8220;En Kelohenu,&#8221; 234<br />\nAnonymous, &#8220;Lift Up Your Hearts!,&#8221; 122<br />\nAnonymous, &#8220;Aspiration,&#8221; 134<br />\nAnonymous, &#8220;Our Wills Be One,&#8221; 136<br />\nAnonymous, &#8220;In God&#8217;s Presence,&#8221; 140<br />\nAnonymous, &#8220;As Pass the Days,&#8221; 146<br />\nAnonymous, &#8220;A Purpose in Life,&#8221; 148<br />\nAnonymous, &#8220;Life&#8217;s Work,&#8221; 154<br />\nAnonymous, &#8220;On Our Way Rejoicing,&#8221; 210<br />\nAnonymous, &#8220;Be Up and Doing!,&#8221; 214<br />\nAnonymous, &#8220;Peace,&#8221; 239<br />\nBernard Barton, &#8220;It Is In Thy Heart,&#8221; 200<br />\nThomas R.
