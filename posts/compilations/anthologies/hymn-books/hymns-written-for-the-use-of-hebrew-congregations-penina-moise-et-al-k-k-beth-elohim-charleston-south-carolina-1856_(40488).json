            "bio": "Penina Moïse (1797-1880) was born to a large and wealthy family in Charleston, South Carolina, the progeny of her merchant father, Abraham Moïse (1736-1809), originally from Strasbourg in Alsace, France, and her mother Sarah from the Jewish community on the Caribbean island of Sint Eustatius in the Netherlands Antilles. Her brother, also named Abraham, was a leader in the <a href=\"/profile/reformed-society-of-israelites/\">Reformed Society of Israelites</a>, and so we imagine she was closely associated with the reformist wing of the congregation it wished to and ultimately succeeded in reforming, <a href=\"/profile/kahal-kadosh-beth-elohim/\">Ḳ.Ḳ. Beth Elohim</a>. Moïse wrote at least 187 prayers for Beth Elohim's hymn books published <a href=\"/?p=39305\">in 1842</a> and <a href=\"/?p=40488\">in 1856</a>. Moïse was also a gifted teacher and, in 1845, became head of Beth Elohim’s religious school. Moïse was a prolific writer, earning praise for her 1833 collection of poems, <em>Fancy’s Sketch Book</em>, as well as her articles for various newspapers across the country.  After the Civil War, she returned to Charleston and ran an academy with her sister and niece. Though her eyesight eventually deteriorated into blindness, she continued to work and write until the end of her life. (This short biographical sketch includes material adapted from <a href=\"https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/moise-penina\">her entry in the Jewish Women's Archive</a> by Jay M. Eidelman.)",

            "bio": "Ḳahal Ḳadosh Beth Elohim (Hebrew: קהל קדוש בית אלהים‎, also known as Ḳ.Ḳ. Beth Elohim, or more simply Congregation Beth Elohim), founded in 1749 in Charleston, South Carolina, is one of the oldest Jewish congregations in the United States. The founding members of the synagogue were Jews of Spanish and Portuguese descent (Sepharadim), who arrived into Charleston via London, England. Before 1830 Ḳahal Ḳadosh Beth Elohim was a place of worship for Spanish and Portuguese Jews using Portuguese rituals as done in Portugal before the Spanish and Portuguese inquisitions. A splinter group animated by the European Reform movement, the <a href=\"/profile/reformed-society-of-israelites/\">Reformed Society of Israelites</a>, formed in 1824. While at first this group did not succeed in reforming Beth Elohim, by the mid 1830s Beth Elohim had reabsorbed its members and its ḥazzan, Gustavus Poznanski (1804–1879), joined the Reform camp in 1840. After the first synagogue building was destroyed by fire in 1838, it was rebuilt two years afterward (in a Greek Revival style designed by Cyrus L. Warner) with an organ to the chagrin of the traditionalists. Ḳahal Ḳadosh Beth Elohim is recognized as the oldest Reform Jewish congregation in the Americas.",

    "excerpt": "The first prayerbook largely composed by a Jewish woman and the first prayerbook compiled by a Jewish woman in the United States. . . .",
    "content": "<p>The first prayerbook compiled by an American Jewish woman, and quite possibly by the first Jewish woman ever, is the hymn-book of Penina Moïse (1797-1880), prepared for her congregation Beth Elohim in Charleston, South Carolina in 1842. This is the second edition (revised 1856) containing 210 hymns, reprinting 73 of the hymns appearing in the 1842 albeit with changes, mostly to punctuation and capitalization, but sometimes with significant changes to wording and omission of entire stanzas. There are in total 137 hymns that are new to this edition (128 of which were written by Penina Moïse). The two other contributors providing new material to the work, identified by their initials, are <a href=\"/profile/moritz-mayer/\">Rabbi Moritz Mayer</a> (1821-1866) and <a href=\"/profile/caroline-de-litchfield-harby\">Caroline de Litchfield Harby</a> (1800-1876). There are three hymns which are unsigned with any initials, but were likely to have been written by Penina Moïse and Moritz Mayer.</p>\n<p>The 1842 edition of the hymn-book, <em><a href=\"/?p=39305\">Hymns Written for the Service of the Hebrew Congregation Beth Elohim, Charleston, S.C.</a></em> (1842) was written over a decade before Fanny Neuda&#8217;s <em><a href=\"/?p=6753\">Stunden der Andacht</a></em> (Hours of Devotion) in 1855, or Hester Rothschild&#8217;s English translation of the French anthology of tehinot and paraliturgical prayer, <em>Imrei Lev</em> (<em><a href=\"/?p=31179\">Prayers and Meditations</a></em>, also in 1855). This edition, published within a year of the latter, is yet another indication of the popularity of prayer literature written by or for Jewish women at this time.</p>\n<p><style type=\"text/css\">\r\n       .errordiv { padding:10px; margin:10px; border: 1px solid #555555;color: #000000;background-color: #f8f8f8; width:500px; }#advanced_iframe {visibility:visible;opacity:1;vertical-align:top;}.ai-info-bottom-iframe { position: fixed; z-index: 10000; bottom:0; left: 0; margin: 0px; text-align: center; width: 100%; background-color: #ff9999; padding-left: 5px;padding-bottom: 5px; border-top: 1px solid #aaa } a.ai-bold {font-weight: bold;}#ai-layer-div-advanced_iframe p {height:100%;margin:0;padding:0}#ai-div-container-advanced_iframe\r\n       { \r\n           position: relative;\r\n           width: 100%; max-width: 100%;}\r\n       #ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe\r\n       {\r\n          position: absolute;\r\n          z-index:1000;\r\n          margin-left:-33px;\r\n          left: 50%;   top: 150px;\r\n         }} \r\n       #ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe img\r\n       {\r\n          border: none;\r\n       }</style><script type=\"text/javascript\">var ai_iframe_width_advanced_iframe = 0;var ai_iframe_height_advanced_iframe = 0;var aiIsIe8=false;var aiOnloadScrollTop=\"true\";var aiShowDebug=false;\r\n\t\tif (typeof aiReadyCallbacks === 'undefined') {\r\n\t\t\tvar aiReadyCallbacks = [];  \r\n\t\t} else if (!(aiReadyCallbacks instanceof Array)) {\r\n\t\t\tvar aiReadyCallbacks = [];\r\n\t\t}    function aiShowIframeId(id_iframe) { jQuery(\"#\"+id_iframe).css(\"visibility\", \"visible\");    }    function aiResizeIframeHeight(height) { aiResizeIframeHeight(height,advanced_iframe); }    function aiResizeIframeHeightId(height,width,id) {aiResizeIframeHeightById(id,height);}</script><div id=\"ai-div-container-advanced_iframe\"><div id=\"ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-loader-icon\" src=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/plugins/advanced-iframe/img/loader.gif\" title=\"Loading\" alt=\"Loading\"></img></div><iframe id=\"advanced_iframe\"  name=\"advanced_iframe\"  src=\"https://archive.org/stream/hymnswrittenforu00kaharich#page/n7/mode/2up\"  width=\"100%\"  height=\"900\"  frameborder=\"0\"  allowtransparency=\"true\"  loading=\"lazy\"  style=\";width:100%;height:900px;;width:1px;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;\"  allowfullscreen  onload='jQuery(&quot;#ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe&quot;).hide();;jQuery(&quot;#ai-div-loader-global&quot;).hide()' ></iframe></div><script type=\"text/javascript\">var ifrm_advanced_iframe = document.getElementById(\"advanced_iframe\");var hiddenTabsDoneadvanced_iframe = false;\r\nfunction resizeCallbackadvanced_iframe() {}var recalculateIframeResizeadvanced_iframe = 0;\r\n        var recalculateIframeOrientationchangeadvanced_iframe = 0;\r\n        var aiWindowWidth = 0;\r\n\t\tfunction recalculateIframeadvanced_iframe() {\r\n          clearTimeout(recalculateIframeResizeadvanced_iframe);\r\n          clearTimeout(recalculateIframeOrientationchangeadvanced_iframe);}  \r\n        function initResponsiveIframeadvanced_iframe() {\r\n          jQuery(window).resize(function() {\r\n\t\t\t recalculateIframeResizeadvanced_iframe = window.setTimeout(\"recalculateIframeadvanced_iframe()\",100);\r\n          });\r\n          if (window.addEventListener) {\r\n            window.addEventListener(\"orientationchange\", function() {\r\n               recalculateIframeOrientationchangeadvanced_iframe = window.setTimeout(\"recalculateIframeadvanced_iframe()\",100);\r\n            }, false);\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n        aiReadyCallbacks.push(initResponsiveIframeadvanced_iframe);</script><style>#advanced_iframe {width: 1px !important;min-width:100% !important;max-width:100% !important;}</style><script type=\"text/javascript\"></script><br />\nThis work is in the Public Domain due to its having been published more than 95 years ago.</p>\n<h3>INDEX (1856 edition, new hymns)</h3>\n<div class=\"two-column\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<u>Penina Moïse</u><br />\nOne God!
