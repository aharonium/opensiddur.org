            "bio": "Gustav Gottheil (May 28, 1827, Pinne/Pniewy, Grand Duchy of Posen, Prussia – April 15, 1903, New York City) was a Prussian born American rabbi. Gottheil eventually became one of the most influential, well-known and controversial Reform Jewish leaders of his time. He was educated in Posen under Rabbi Solomon Plessner, and later continued his studies at the universities of Berlin and Halle (Ph.D.), receiving in the meanwhile his \"hattarat hora'ah\" in the former city from Samuel Holdheim, whose assistant he became (1855). He also studied under Zunz and Moritz Steinschneider. In 1860 he set out from the Berliner Reformgemeinde to labor for Reform Judaism in new fields. In 1860 he received a call from the Reform Jews of Manchester, England; he went there as rabbi for the Manchester Congregation of British Jews and remained for 13 years. During this time he was connected with the faculty of Owens College as a teacher of the German language. Two of his most noteworthy sermons preached in Manchester were on the slavery question, attacking those who had declared the institution to be sanctioned by Mosaic law. Dr. Gottheil was a member of the Synod of Leipsic in 1871, which took a decided stand on the question of Reform. He left Manchester in 1873, having been elected to succeed the Rev. J. K. Gutheim as assistant to Dr. Samuel Adler, the senior rabbi of Temple Emanu-El, New York City. When Adler retired about eighteen months later, Gottheil succeeded him. On taking charge he reorganized the religious school, and assisted in founding a theological school where preliminary training might be imparted to future candidates for the rabbinate. He prepared in 1886 the first Jewish hymn-book printed in America (with music in a separate volume by A. Davis); it contains not only traditional Jewish hymns, but also others of Christian origin, and upon it was based the Union Hymnal, which has since been generally adopted by the Reform congregations in the United States. In 1889 he started the first Sisterhood of Personal Service, a philanthropic organization affiliated with Temple Emanu-El which served as a model for similar institutions elsewhere. Dr. Gottheil was the founder of the Association of Eastern Rabbis, and when it was assimilated with the Central Conference of American Rabbis in 1890, he took an active part in its deliberations. He was one of the founders and the president of the (American) Jewish Publication Society, vice-president of the Federation of American Zionists, chairman of the Revision Committee for the Union Prayer Book, and one of the governors of the Hebrew Union College, in Cincinnati. Dr. Gottheil's sympathies and interests were broadly universalist, as evidenced by his connection with various non-Jewish institutions as well as by many of his sermons and writings. He was one of the founders of the New York State Conference of Religions, assisting in the editing of its \"Book of Common Prayers\"; and a founder and for many years vice-president of the Nineteenth Century Club. In 1893 Gottheil was one of the representatives of the Jews at the Parliament of Religions, held in Chicago during the World Columbian Exposition.",

After finishing the gymnasium course in Kecskemét, he removed to Budapest. Anxious to continue his rabbinical studies, he went to Breslau. In 1865, he received a call to the rabbinate of Tarnowitz, Upper Silesia. He then spent another year in Breslau, devoting his time to Oriental philology and Semitics. During the previous year he received his Ph.D. degree from the University of Leipzig, his dissertation being \"Ueber die Jüdische Angelogie und Daemonologie in Ihrer Abhängigkeit vom Parsismus.\" The essay was published by the Deutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft in 1866, it being the first Jewish work issued under the auspices of that society. He obtained his rabbinical diploma in 1867. It was in 1864 that he began to collect materials for a critical edition of the 'Aruk of Nathan ben Jehiel. In 1880 Kohut was called to Oradea, Hungary, where he remained until 1884. At Oradea he became acquainted with Kálmán Tisza, prime minister of Hungary, who, hearing him speak at a national gathering of notables, was so carried away by his eloquence that he caused him to be called to the Hungarian parliament as representative of the Jews. In 1885 Kohut was elected rabbi of Congregation Ahavath Chesed in New York. Kohut was associated with Rabbi Sabato Morais in founding the Jewish Theological Seminary of New York, becoming one of its advisory board, and being active as professor of Talmudic methodology up to the time of his death. In 1889, on the occasion of his finishing the Aruch Completum, he was the recipient of many honors, notably at the hands of various learned bodies in Europe.",

In 1848, he studied in Vienna, but when the revolution of that year broke out he went to Pressburg. From 1849 to 1855 he tutored in private families in Hungary, and in the latter year entered the University of Breslau, where he remained until 1858. While a student he officiated during the holy days at Brieg, Silesia (1857), and at Stockholm, Sweden (1858). In 1859, he accepted a call from the Temple Oheb Shalom (Baltimore, Maryland) in whose service he remained until his death, first as rabbi and later (after 1892) as rabbi emeritus.  Under his guidance it grew rapidly, and, actuated by his example, it became widely known for its strict observance of Shabbat. Before Szold's arrival the congregation had adopted for use in its Shabbat service the Minhag America, (which was the new prayer-book written by Isaac Meyer Wise, a Reform rabbi) on the great fall holy days it reverted to the Minhag Ashkenaz; after much discussion with his congregation Szold introduced a new prayer-book, Abodat Yisrael, which closely followed traditional lines.",

Louis Stern gave the first impetus to the work in a paper upon &#8220;Home-Worship,&#8221; wherein he forcibly demonstrated the vital and immediate necessity for some such book, to conserve aught of the olden spirit of Jewish piety in our American homes. A committee, consisting of Rev. Drs. G. Gottheil, F. de Sola Mendes and H.W. Schneeberger, was appointed to prepare a practical report upon the suggestion, and in May, 1886, this committee from which Dr. Schneeberger had meanwhile retired, reported that on due examination it found a little manual entitled &#8220;Haus-Andacht,&#8221; and published by Rev. Drs. Szold and Jastrow,<span class=\"footnote_referrer\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_1');\" onkeypress=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_1');\" ><sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_1\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\">[1]</sup></a><span id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_1\" class=\"footnote_tooltip\"> Full title: <em>Israelitisches Gebetbuch für die häusliche Andacht</em> by Benjamin Szold in its revision by Marcus Jastrow in 1875. The original prayerbook by Benjamin Szold was published in 1867.&nbsp;</span></span><script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery('#footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_1').tooltip({ tip: '#footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_1', tipClass: 'footnote_tooltip', effect: 'fade', predelay: 0, fadeInSpeed: 200, delay: 400, fadeOutSpeed: 200, position: 'center right', relative: true, offset: [0, 0], });</script> eminently fitted to serve as the foundation of such a work, and that likewise it was authorized to state that these gentlemen would relinquish to the Association all rights to an English version. The committee, to which then Rev. Drs. K. Kohler, A. Kohut and L. Stern were added, was requested to proceed with the translation and elaboration of the &#8220;Haus-Andacht,&#8221; and, with valuable preparatory work done by Miss Henrietta Szold, the committee presented in November the MS. of an English version of the same. It was, however, thought advisable that this should be considerably enlarged by the addition of new prayers and meditations not included in the original, and the committee, from which, however, Rev. Dr. Kohler withdrew, was authorized to print and publish the same under the auspices of the Association when completed to its satisfaction. The result is the present volume. </p>\n<p>In presenting this book, the undersigned desire it to be understood that it is in no wise intended to interfere with any existing congregational ritual, but simply to supply an acknowledged want in our households, a vernacular home-manual of religious reading in the line of Jewish devotion. Accordingly, matters of doctrine and interpretation whereon opinion might be found to differ among us, were either altogether avoided or given such broadly Jewish expression as could evoke dissent in the minds of none; our book is intended for all. </p>\n<p>Sabbath evening prayers for the home circle, so worthy of introduction, are here suggested; so too for each of the Festivals, with an appropriate Table-grace which may supplement the customary Ḳiddush. Short daily morning and evening prayers, with special petitions suited for the individual circumstances of the members of the household, including children; births and marriages, too, the dedication of a new home, journeys, voyages, all were believed to be proper subjects for treatment in a manual of household devotion. Finally, those mournful days which likewise must come to every home, when sickness renders anxious and death startles our too thoughtless round of life, furnish abundant scope for petition and meditation, in the home and in the cemetery, for private as well as for public prayer, a form of which last has been added. For these days primarily, but for all other days as well, a series of ethical readings and a few poetical selections have been included, and the gems of thought and of lyric art thus gathered here, it is presumed, will be unwelcome to no one. </p>\n<p>It remains but to add that while the general selection has been the work of all the undersigned, the responsibility for the treatment, diction and editorship generally, rests with Rev. Dr. de Sola Mendes, from whose pen likewise are the Meditations for the Sabbaths, the Festivals, the Daily Prayers for Children, and sundry occasional prayers, such as that for a student, for dedicating a new house etc., etc. Rev. Dr. Gottheil collaborated especially in the ethical readings, (which it is believed are given here in terse and forcible rendition,) as well as in contributing sound editorial criticism throughout the whole course of the work. </p>\n<p>In conclusion, we beg to say we consider this present effort a tentative one: our English-speaking brethren must pass the final verdict upon it, and their suggestions will be held in view in future editions. It is especially to our brother ministers that we shall look for aid in this direction. Our inspiration has been the natural prayerfulness of Israel&#8217;s children, which in all generations has put forth such beauteous tendrils of prayer and praise, of psalm and devotional meditation; and with it, the pressing necessity which prevails for furnishing some such hand-book to lead that inherited disposition as on trelliswork, to trained and well ordered growth and luxuriance. May this our effort help to preserve that inestimable possession of our people, its home-religion, whereupon alone home-happiness is founded. And may He, whom Israel in all ages has revered as the &#8220;Hearkener to Prayer&#8221; <span class=\"hebrew\" lang=\"he\">שומע תפלה</span>, bless our earnest endeavor to feed the flame of devotion in Judah&#8217;s homes, and to contribute to the preservation of unity of spirit among all our brethren. </p>\n<p>Gustav Gottheil,<br />\nTemple Emanuel, New York.</p>\n<p>F. de Sola Mendes,<br />\nCong.
