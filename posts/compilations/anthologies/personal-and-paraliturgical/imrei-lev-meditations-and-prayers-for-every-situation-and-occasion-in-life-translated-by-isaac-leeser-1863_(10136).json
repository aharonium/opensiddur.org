He was for twenty-six years attached to the Jewish school of Strasbourg, of which he became the head. In collaboration with Hirth, he compiled a Dictionnaire Général de Géographie Universelle (4 vols., Strasburg, 1839–41), for which Cuvier wrote a preface. Soon afterward he published Le Sentier d'Israël, ou Bible des Jeunes Israélites (Paris, Metz, and Strasburg, 1843). At the request of the Société des Bons Livres he took part in the editorship of Prières d'un Cœur Israélite, which appeared in 1848. In 1849, despite anti-Jewish rioting in Alsace, Ennery was elected representative for the department of the Lower Rhine, and sat among the members of the \"Mountain.\" He devoted his attention principally to scholastic questions. After the coup d'état he held to his socialist republican views and resisted the new order of things. For this, in 1852 he was exiled from France for life. He retired to Brussels, where he lived as a teacher until his death. Ennery's brother, Marchand Ennery, was the chief rabbi of Paris.",

In 1830 he became rabbi of the small community of Hegenheim in Upper Alsace; and of Strasbourg in 1833. As he was under thirty, the age prescribed by law, he required a special dispensation to qualify for the office. In Strasbourg, Aron acquired the reputation of an eloquent and inspiring preacher and a zealous communal worker. He assisted in founding the School of Arts and Trades and took active interest in other useful institutions. In 1855 he convened an assembly of the rabbis of the department of the Lower Rhine for the consideration of religious questions. Aron was the author of the catechism used for confirmation as prescribed by the Consistory of Lower Alsace. In 1866 the French government acknowledged his services by appointing him a Knight of the Legion of Honor. In 1870, while Strasbourg was besieged, it was he, together with the archbishop, who raised the white flag on the cathedral. Subsequently he was decorated by the German emperor.",

The original work by Rabbi Arnaud Aron and Jonas Ennery contains tkhines translated into French, prayers by German reformers in French translation, and many additional liturgical translations and paraliturgical prayers. Rothschild&#8217;s work presents several prayers in English unique to her compilation by Anglo-Jewish writers. Leeser&#8217;s corrections in our opinion present improved translations over Rothschild&#8217;s work in some cases &#8212; and a more complete comparison is necessary to determine which material in this work is original to Leeser in order to properly provide credit for each paryer.</p>\n<style type=\"text/css\">\r\n       .errordiv { padding:10px;

I am induced to appeal to your gentlemanly feeling and sense of right by an old and esteemed friend Mr Jacob Franklin, whom you know as he has taken some trouble in your behalf in the matter of your translation of the Bible; and he assures me that although there is no international copyright between England and the United States, yet, you would be certain to acknowledge the moral obligations existing towards a laborer, however humble, who, although working but in the vestibule of literature, has bestowed much care, love and conscientiousness on the little volume in question. Therefore, I must claim from you, the withdrawal of the expressions „corrected and revised by Isaac Leeser” from your advertisements as well as from the work which should not be altered except by myself whilst it bears my name and I am still living. Hoping, Sir, that you will be good enough to accede to my wish</p>\n<p>I have the honor to be, Sir<br />\nYours very obediently<br />\nHester Rothschild</p>\n<h3>[Isaac Leeser&#8217;s Preface]</h3>\n<p>In presenting this volume of meditations and prayers to the public, but little need be said on the propriety, we may almost say the necessity, of issuing a work of the kind to serve as a manual of domestic devotion in addition to our usual public form of service, whether of the Portuguese or German custom. Nothing, indeed, at all equal to this has ever been given to the world; for, let fault-finders say what they will, not a book of devotion ever devised contains so much that is sublime, useful, instructive, and consolatory, as does our liturgy. Still, it has always been the custom of our people to have short prayers in the languages used by them, in addition to the daily and festival services; and it is only following the good example of the great ones of former years, to place in the hands of our females especially a book which is, so to say, a mirror of the soul, containing reflections and short formulae of petitions or thanksgiving adapted to the several circumstances of our existence, to serve as a constant companion in our life’s journey, whether the incidents be of joy or of sorrow. It is erroneous to assert that Israelites are opposed to the use of prayer in the languages of the various countries. The efforts which have been made, both in ancient and modern times, to furnish special composition in tongues other than the Hebrew, and this by the most earnest and pious teachers, prove the contrary. The retention of the Hebrew, however, has quite another reason, namely, to maintain our national speech as the vehicle for public prayers and reading of the Law, in order to preserve a bond of union which, while it exists, can withstand all assaults against our religion, as it enables us, at all times, to verify any assertion made as founded on the Scriptures, by referring at once to the original text, which will uniformly refute all forced constructions, that are generally the only proof against our faith. But if the Hebrew were once banished, we should have to rely on authorised versions of the Holy Text, and thus open the door to all the evils resulting from resorting to a varying standard, which in itself is but an approximation to, not a perfect transcript of, the Divine Word. As long as our worship is, therefore, in the language of Israel, this will be studied and far better understood than others which are not the vernacular of the respective countries where we live, and will, at the same time, render the Synagogue an acceptable meeting-place for Israelites all over the world, who will listen there to a worship in which they can freely participate, as it is the same, or nearly the same, allowing for differences in Minhag, with what they have been accustomed to from infancy. It is, therefore, absolutely requisite that the knowledge of the Hebrew should be universally diffused among us, so that it may be, in truth, the language of heartfelt devotion, —not merely a lip-service without effect on the mind.</p>\n<p>While the public service, therefore, ought not to be changed, there is no reason why, for other objects, many books of devotional exercises, in all modern languages, should not be written by competent persons. It is, however, not to be denied, that this peculiar composition is one of the most difficult in the whole range of literature; for to think for others, to excite in them the feelings that agitate us, to lift them up to our own mental elevation, or to enter into the sentiments of their hearts, which we have, perhaps, never experienced, is surely not an easy thing, and requires a peculiar talent which very few can possess. It is, therefore, nowise remarkable that many who attempt to compose voluntary prayers utterly fail, and furnish thus indirectly the most convincing proof that the body of our liturgy should never be touched, as it can never be equalled or materially improved. The editor, when he commenced delivering public lectures, prefaced and concluded them with prayers of his own, in imitation of the European preachers; but latterly he has generally omitted them, being satisfied with the set forms of our books. Indeed, when one views attentively the feeble efforts of many who venture on prayer-making, he must soon come to the conclusion that they had better choose another field for their exertions, since they fail to excite devotion in their hearers, and utter words before Heaven which cannot be acceptable before Him. For it should not be forgotten, that we have only one model for entreaty and thanksgiving, namely, the Holy Scriptures; and that in framing either, we should carefully adhere to the views, doctrines, hopes, and aspirations which they have furnished us, while in putting in opinions of our own we may unconsciously blaspheme instead of uttering praises.</p>\n<p>There are, it is admitted, many situations for which the Bible furnishes no example of prayer which we should offer therein. Since the close of the holy canon, new things and new historical developments have been ushered in, and given birth to new trains of thought. But in treating them as the subjects of prayer, we must, for all that, hold fast to our standard, and take heed that no ideas foreign to Judaism or unworthy to be offered to the God of Israel should find even a temporary sojourn in our devotional exercises. Besides, though events have not stood still in history, and though inventions have multiplied through ages past, no new truths have been evolved, and the simple words of the Bible are still as true as in the beginning, wherefore they present us, even now, as in past ages, with the best specimens of prayer, which alone, being revealed, can be acceptable to our Maker, the Author no less of the word than of the works of creation.</p>\n<p>We should, accordingly, welcome as a valuable gift every book written in the spirit of the Scriptures, giving us prayers couched in the form and after the model of the liturgy furnished to us by our wise men of blessed memory. What they have done for the people is permitted to be done for the individual; they looked on the individual Israelite as a part of the indestructible people of God: the set prayers, therefore, always bring before us the idea of nationality, the restoration of all that was desirable in ancient times, the religion in its full effulgence, the nation in all its glory. They left it to the single Israelite “to ask his wants” in any manner he pleased. Hence they who do understand how to arrange the wants of the single man and Woman in becoming language on the scriptural basis, have only followed in the footsteps of our sages and rendered an important service to the progress of godliness among us.</p>\n<p>As regards the present work, in which the editor claims no more than that it has been carefully revised and corrected by him, —it is the product of Mr. J. Ennery,<span class=\"footnote_referrer\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_1');\" onkeypress=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_1');\" ><sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_1\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\">[1]</sup></a><span id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_1\" class=\"footnote_tooltip\"> The author of “Le Sentier d’Israel,” translated and published in Philadelphia, under the name of the “Path of Israel,” by the Hebrew Publication Society.&nbsp;</span></span><script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery('#footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_1').tooltip({ tip: '#footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_1', tipClass: 'footnote_tooltip', effect: 'fade', predelay: 0, fadeInSpeed: 200, delay: 400, fadeOutSpeed: 200, position: 'center right', relative: true, offset: [0, 0], });</script>&nbsp; as he has been informed, and was issued in 5608 (1848) at Strasburg, France, under the supervision of Rabbi Arnaud Aron, and with his approval. It soon made its way wherever the French language is understood; and a copy of the second edition (1858) is now before the editor. Its success in France induced Mrs. Hester Rothschild, of London, who, it is believed, is a Danish lady, to translate it into English, so that it might effect also its beneficent mission among those who speak the language of Britain. It appeared thus in London in 5616 [1855], and again in 5620 [1859]. The few copies which reached America were readily disposed of; and the demand having increased, while the circumstances of the times have rendered the importation of books for general use almost impossible, has caused this revised American edition to be issued. As the work is not a literal translation from the French, and is in many instances greatly abridged, for reasons by which the translator is perfectly justified, the editor of the American edition has farther revised it, and at times re-written entire passages, that the book may be more in accordance with the principles of prayer as laid down above; though he is free to acknowledge that it has not lost altogether the character of a translation, to avoid which it would have been necessary to recast the whole, and has, besides, some other defects inherent in all human productions. But, as he was bound not to deviate too far from the original, and thus give the public a different book from what its title professes, he had to limit himself to correcting, and has added nothing to what was not before him. He much desired to write several pieces for occasions not embraced in the present collection; but he declined doing so now, hoping that the time may be propitious hereafter to present another book containing original prayers by several competent men, in which he trusts to have a share assigned to him among the laborers for the welfare of Israel. With the present the subject is not exhausted, nor will it interfere with similar books issued by others both here and in England; but the editor honestly thinks that the spirit of piety will be promoted, not hindered, when the devout have at hand several devotional works from which to draw hope, encouragement, comfort, and divine aid on all fitting occasions. With these remarks he entrusts this production of pious men, in which a daughter of Israel has had a material share, to the kindness of his fellow-Israelites, in the full confidence that they will discover in it much that will raise their hearts and souls to the Author of our life, the benevolent Father, the God of truth, —the One who was, who is, and who will be in glory for ever and ever.</p>\n<p>Isaac Leeser<br />\nPhiladelphia, Ab 7, August 9, 5624 [1863].</p>\n<h3>TABLE OF CONTENTS</h3>\n<p>DAILY PRAYERS.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Prayer on entering the Synagogue<br />\nHymn.

We all feel the want of pouring forth the soul&#8217;s emotions of joy or sorrow by communion with the Universal Father; general public forms of prayer may not always be adapted to the peculiar exigencies of every mind; the compilers of this work have therefore striven to supply in some measure this spiritual need, by meditations and prayers suited to every situation and occasion in life; and it has been the humble yet anxious endeavour of the translator to preserve the spirit of the original in its English garb. But, as the genius of the French language differs so widely from that of our own, a mere translation of phrases would render this impossible; it has often been found necessary, therefore, to arrange the same ideas in a very different order and form of language to the original, and even sometimes to remodel them altogether; thus this little volume frequently partakes of the character of an adaptation.</p>\n<p>Having ventured these remarks in apology for the deviations from the original, the translator trusts the public will receive with lenient judgment this result of the employment of some leisure hours; and if the use of these pages produce but to one member of the Hebrew family anything like the soul&#8217;s satisfaction and comfort that have been derived from this “labour of love,” the translator will deem it an ample reward.</p>\n<p>Hester Rothschild</p>\n<p>LONDON, Adar 28, March 13, 5616, A.M. [1855]</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>[From the preface to <em>אמרי לב Prières d’un Cœur Israélite</em> (1848):]</strong></p>\n<p>La Société consistoriale pour la propagation des bons livres réalise aujourd’hui sa première œuvre, en offrant aux fidèles un recueil de prières et de méditations religieuses.</p>\n<p>En choisissant ce livre pour notre début, nous avons eu à cœur de répondre à un besoin généralement senti, et de remplir une lacune très-grave dans la littérature moderne de notre culte.</p>\n<p>Ce n&#8217;est pas que l&#8217;idée et la nécessité d’un livre de ce genre soient bien nouvelles parmi nous; les suppliques (תחנות) imprimées, comme appendice, à la fin des anciennes éditions de nos rituels, prouveraient suffisamment le contraire; mais toutes ces prières, expressions fidèles des sentiments pieux de nos ancêtres, sont écrites dans un allemand corrompu, et dont aucune traduction n’existe daas notre langue; elles sont d’ailleurs conçues dans un esprit et formulées dans un style incompatibles avec les exigences de notre époque.</p>\n<p>Notre rituel ordinaire ne peut non plus suffire au recueillement individuel: inspiré soit de souvenirs historiques, soit de chants patriotiques, ou de poésies religieuses, il semble n’avoir eu en vue que la prière officielle, (תפלת חובה) ce qui résulte encore du sens collectif de la plupart de ses formules. Or, c’est là le caractère le mieux approprié aux prières destinées au culte public, et, à ce titre, notre rituel peut soutenir dignement la comparaison avec ceux de tous les autres cultes.</p>\n<p>Mais, à côté de la prière officielle, il est un besoin non moins divin: c’est celtii qu’éprouve l’âme de s’épancher, dans un recueillement intime, devant le maître de nos destinées, de lui offrir le tribut de ses soupirs comme celui de ses joies; de lui exprimer sa gratitude ou ses espérances; c’est ce que nous appelons la prière individuelle. Or, la prière individuelle ne saurait se plier aux formules générales; elle s&#8217;inspire d&#8217;une situation personnelle et puise ses expressions dans le sentiment. Un livre de prières et de méditations religieuses doit donc être comme une lyre harmonieuse, dont les cordes diverses résonnent sous les variables émotions de l’âme. Il faut qu’il y ait des sons pour la joie et la douleur, pour le bonheur et pour le deuil, pour le convalescent qui se relève, et pour le malade qui s’éteint. C’est à ce besoin que nous essayons de répondre aujourd&#8217;hui.</p>\n<p>Loin de nous la prétention de remplacer le <em>rituel</em>; ce legs des hommes de la grande synagogue sera toujours notre plus beau joyau; mais, placés à un autre point de vue, nous avons cru devoir faire autrement.</p>\n<p>Toutefois ce n’est pas au culte domestique exclusivement que nous vouons ce livre. Nous souhaitons, au contraire, qu’il accompagne les fidèles jusque dans le temple, et qu’il contribue avec nos saintes cérémonies à leur inspirer le recueillement et à les préserver de toute distraction. C’est pourquoi nous avons emprunté au rituel et aux Pioutim quelques morceaux choisis, et affecté un certain nombre de prières aux divers offices du culte public, surtout pour les jours de fête.</p>\n<p>Nous n’avons que peu de mots à ajouter sur la manière dont nous avons cru pouvoir remplir notre tâche. Nous avons cherché à donner à nos prières une forme simple, claire, dénuée de toute prétention littéraire. La prière étant l&#8217;expression la plus intime des rapports de l’homme avec Dieu, perd son caractère de vérité, si, au lieu de jaillir simple et facile, elle s’égare dans l’affectation et les métaphores. Nous avons donc évité avec soin ces tirades déclamatoires, ces ornements lyriques qui, à notre avis, déparent quelques ouvrages de ce genre. Devant qui doit-on être vrai si ce n’est en présence de celui qui sonde les derniers replis de nos cœurs, et qui s’appelle Dieu de vérité, יי אלהים אמת?</p>\n<p>Un très-grand nombre des prières de notre recueil sont originales, d&#8217;autres sont imitées de nos livres sacrés, ou traduites un rituel et du Machsor, sans cependant que nous nous soyons attachés servilement au texte littéral, toutes les fois que le génie de notre langue exigeait une forme différente. Enfin, nous avons plus d’une fois puisé dans les excellents livres de piété publiés en Allemagne, notamment par Letteris, Jacobsohn, Rosenfeld, etc.; leurs ouvrages nous ont fourni le sujet et quelquefois le texte de plusieurs morceaux. Que ces savanta coreligionnaires veuillent recevoir ici l&#8217;hommage public de notre reconnaissance.</p>\n<p>Pour la division matérielle de notre ouvrage, nous avons adopté la classification suivante:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Prières qui reviennent périodiquement, soit tous les jours, soit aux jours de fête.</li>\n<li>Prières et méditations religieuses pour les diverses circonstances de la vie; ces méditations remplissent une lacune importante de notre rituel, qui n’a pas de prières pour ce que nous appelons la piété domestique.</li>\n<li>Prières de deuil, à réciter soit aux anniversaires, soit au cimetière.</li>\n<li>Enfin, dans une quatrième et dernière partie, nous avons placé quelques morceaux de philosophie religieuse, qui sont plutôt des préparations à la foi que de véritables prières.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Avant dé terminer, qu’il nous soit permis d’adresser une humble supplique à nos lecleurs et surtout à nos pieuses lectrices. Nous les conjurons de ne pas lire ce livre comme on lit une œuvre de littérature, c’est-à-dire avec l’esprit d’analyse et de critique. La prière écrite, quelque parfaite qu’elle soit, est impuissante si l’élan du cœur ne la complète, si l’enthousiasme de l’âme ne l’é-chauffe. Or, l’analyse refroidit l’âme et les sentiments du cœur. Ouvrez donc ce livre avec la pieuse intention de prier, et non de lire, alors la religion vous inspirera, et votre prière étant l’expression de votre foi, sera agréable au Seigneur.</p>\n<p>Strasbourg, janvier 1848 (Schebat 5608).</p>\n<p>Le grand-rabbin du Consistoire du Bas-Rhin,</p>\n<p>Arnaud Aron.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"speaker-mute footnotes_reference_container\"> <div class=\"footnote_container_prepare\"><p><span role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"footnote_reference_container_label pointer\" onclick=\"footnote_expand_collapse_reference_container__1();\">Notes</span><span role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"footnote_reference_container_collapse_button\" style=\"display: none;\" onclick=\"footnote_expand_collapse_reference_container__1();\">[<a id=\"footnote_reference_container_collapse_button__1\">+</a>]</span></p></div> <div id=\"footnote_references_container__1\" style=\"\"><table class=\"footnotes_table footnote-reference-container\"><caption class=\"accessibility\">Notes</caption> <tbody> \r\n\r\n<tr class=\"footnotes_plugin_reference_row\"> <th scope=\"row\" id=\"footnote_plugin_reference__1_1\" class=\"footnote_plugin_index pointer\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor__1('footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_1');\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"footnote_plugin_link\" >1</a></th> <td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">The author of “Le Sentier d’Israel,” translated and published in Philadelphia, under the name of the “Path of Israel,” by the Hebrew Publication Society.</td></tr>\r\n\r\n </tbody> </table> </div></div><script type=\"text/javascript\"> function footnote_expand_reference_container__1() { jQuery('#footnote_references_container__1').show(); jQuery('#footnote_reference_container_collapse_button__1').text('−'); } function footnote_collapse_reference_container__1() { jQuery('#footnote_references_container__1').hide(); jQuery('#footnote_reference_container_collapse_button__1').text('+'); } function footnote_expand_collapse_reference_container__1() { if (jQuery('#footnote_references_container__1').is(':hidden')) { footnote_expand_reference_container__1(); } else { footnote_collapse_reference_container__1(); } } function footnote_moveToReference__1(p_str_TargetID) { footnote_expand_reference_container__1(); var l_obj_Target = jQuery('#' + p_str_TargetID); if (l_obj_Target.length) { jQuery( 'html, body' ).delay( 0 ); jQuery('html, body').animate({ scrollTop: l_obj_Target.offset().top - window.innerHeight * 0.2 }, 380); } } function footnote_moveToAnchor__1(p_str_TargetID) { footnote_expand_reference_container__1(); var l_obj_Target = jQuery('#' + p_str_TargetID); if (l_obj_Target.length) { jQuery( 'html, body' ).delay( 0 ); jQuery('html, body').animate({ scrollTop: l_obj_Target.offset().top - window.innerHeight * 0.2 }, 380); } }</script>",
