In 1855, she became the second Jewish woman to have translated a collection of teḥinot into English, after her friend Miriam Wertheimer. Her work, <span class=\"hebrew\">אמרי לב</span> <em>Prayers and Meditation</em>, approved by then chief rabbi Nathan Marcus Adler, contained an abridged translation of the French compilation of teḥinot and paraliturgical prayers <span class=\"hebrew\">אמרי לב</span> <em>Prières d’un Cœur Israelite</em> (1848). She was an intimate friend of the Danish-Jewish writer, Meïr Aron Goldschmidt. Her husband, a diamond merchant, was Lewis Meyer (Benjamin) Rothschild of Denmark.",

In 1830 he became rabbi of the small community of Hegenheim in Upper Alsace; and of Strasbourg in 1833. As he was under thirty, the age prescribed by law, he required a special dispensation to qualify for the office. In Strasbourg, Aron acquired the reputation of an eloquent and inspiring preacher and a zealous communal worker. He assisted in founding the School of Arts and Trades and took active interest in other useful institutions. In 1855 he convened an assembly of the rabbis of the department of the Lower Rhine for the consideration of religious questions. Aron was the author of the catechism used for confirmation as prescribed by the Consistory of Lower Alsace. In 1866 the French government acknowledged his services by appointing him a Knight of the Legion of Honor. In 1870, while Strasbourg was besieged, it was he, together with the archbishop, who raised the white flag on the cathedral. Subsequently he was decorated by the German emperor.",

He was for twenty-six years attached to the Jewish school of Strasbourg, of which he became the head. In collaboration with Hirth, he compiled a Dictionnaire Général de Géographie Universelle (4 vols., Strasburg, 1839–41), for which Cuvier wrote a preface. Soon afterward he published Le Sentier d'Israël, ou Bible des Jeunes Israélites (Paris, Metz, and Strasburg, 1843). At the request of the Société des Bons Livres he took part in the editorship of Prières d'un Cœur Israélite, which appeared in 1848. In 1849, despite anti-Jewish rioting in Alsace, Ennery was elected representative for the department of the Lower Rhine, and sat among the members of the \"Mountain.\" He devoted his attention principally to scholastic questions. After the coup d'état he held to his socialist republican views and resisted the new order of things. For this, in 1852 he was exiled from France for life. He retired to Brussels, where he lived as a teacher until his death. Ennery's brother, Marchand Ennery, was the chief rabbi of Paris.",

We all feel the want of pouring forth the soul&#8217;s emotions of joy or sorrow by communion with the Universal Father; general public forms of prayer may not always be adapted to the peculiar exigencies of every mind; the compilers of this work have therefore striven to supply in some measure this spiritual need, by meditations and prayers suited to every situation and occasion in life; and it has been the humble yet anxious endeavour of the translator to preserve the spirit of the original in its English garb. But, as the genius of the French language differs so widely from that of our own, a mere translation of phrases would render this impossible; it has often been found necessary, therefore, to arrange the same ideas in a very different order and form of language to the original, and even sometimes to remodel them altogether; thus this little volume frequently partakes of the character of an adaptation.</p>\n<p>Having ventured these remarks in apology for the deviations from the original, the translator trusts the public will receive with lenient judgment this result of the employment of some leisure hours; and if the use of these pages produce but to one member of the Hebrew family anything like the soul&#8217;s satisfaction and comfort that have been derived from this “labour of love,” the translator will deem it an ample reward.</p>\n<p>Hester Rothschild</p>\n<p>LONDON, Adar 28, March 13, 5616, A.M. [1855]</p>\n<p><strong>Advertisement to the Second Edition</strong></p>\n<p>In offering a Second Edition of אמרי לב Prayers and Meditations to the Anglo-Jewish public, I must remark, that it has been carefully revised and corrected; there are some additions, and likewise, as I hope the reader will consider, many improvements, for which I am indebted to the grammatical and critical knowledge of the Rev. Isaac H. Myers, of Ramsgate, to whom I take this opportunity of presenting my grateful acknowledgments, for his friendly and valuable assistance in the progress of this work. Having received many encouraging assurances that good has resulted from the first fruits of my labour, I am induced to hope that the seeds now sown may be equally productive.</p>\n<p>[Hester
