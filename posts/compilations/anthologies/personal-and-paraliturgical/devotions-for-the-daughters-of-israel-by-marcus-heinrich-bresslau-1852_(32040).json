            "bio": "Marcus Heinrich (also Mordecai Ḥayyim/Hyman/Heyman) Bresslau (ca. 1808-15 May 1864) was a Hebraist and newspaper editor. Born in Hamburg, he settled in England when young. For some time from 1834 he was Baal Ḳoreh (reader) at the Western Synagogue. He then taught Hebrew at the Westminster Jews’ Free School and went on to tutor privately. A maskil, he became involved with M. J. Raphall’s <em>Hebrew Review and Magazine of Rabbinical Literature</em> (1834-6). In October 1844 he was appointed editor of the relaunched <em>Jewish Chronicle</em> by proprietor Joseph Mitchell. Prickly and quarrelsome, he resigned in July 1848 but returned in around September. He remained until about October 1850. After Mitchell’s death in June 1854 he became proprietor (his middle name appearing as Heyman) and edited it until February 1855 when new proprietor Abraham Benisch succeeded him. Bresslau, who tried vainly to revive the <em>Hebrew Review</em>, wrote Hebrew poetry, produced a Hebrew grammar and a Hebrew dictionary, and translated various Hebrew manuscripts in the Bodleian Library. Bresslau compiled (we think) the first compilation of teḥinot in English for women. (Much of this information via Bresslau's entry in The Palgrave Dictionary of Anglo-Jewish History)",

    "content": "<p><em>Teḥinot Banot Yisrael: Devotions for the Daughters of Israel</em> (1852) by Marcus Heinrich Bresslau is one of the first collections of <em>teḥinot</em> published for an English speaking audience. Bresslau explains in his preface that his work was translated and adapted &#8220;from a Prayer Book in general use throughout Germany.&#8221; Alas, he offers no other bibliographic reference for the volume in which his work relied so much upon. (If you think you know, please <a href=\"/contact/\">contact us</a> or leave a comment below.)</p>\n<p>This collection of <em>teḥinot</em> follows the publication in French of <em>Imrei Lev: Prières D’un Cœur Israélite</em> (1848) by Jonas Ennery and Rabbi Arnaud Aron &#8212; and precedes the publication of Stunden der Andacht (1855), Fanny Neuda&#8217;s collection of her <em>teḥinot</em> written in German. All of these express a movement of tkhines literature beyond an audience of vernacular Yiddish readers and into a world of emancipated Jews more fluent in the language of the modernizing states in which they lived.</p>\n<style type=\"text/css\">\r\n       .errordiv { padding:10px; margin:10px; border: 1px solid #555555;color: #000000;background-color: #f8f8f8; width:500px; }#advanced_iframe {visibility:visible;opacity:1;vertical-align:top;}.ai-info-bottom-iframe { position: fixed; z-index: 10000; bottom:0; left: 0; margin: 0px; text-align: center; width: 100%; background-color: #ff9999; padding-left: 5px;padding-bottom: 5px; border-top: 1px solid #aaa } a.ai-bold {font-weight: bold;}#ai-layer-div-advanced_iframe p {height:100%;margin:0;padding:0}#ai-div-container-advanced_iframe\r\n       { \r\n           position: relative;\r\n           width: 100%; max-width: 100%;}\r\n       #ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe\r\n       {\r\n          position: absolute;\r\n          z-index:1000;\r\n          margin-left:-33px;\r\n          left: 50%;   top: 150px;\r\n         }} \r\n       #ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe img\r\n       {\r\n          border: none;\r\n       }</style><script type=\"text/javascript\">var ai_iframe_width_advanced_iframe = 0;var ai_iframe_height_advanced_iframe = 0;var aiIsIe8=false;var aiOnloadScrollTop=\"true\";var aiShowDebug=false;\r\n\t\tif (typeof aiReadyCallbacks === 'undefined') {\r\n\t\t\tvar aiReadyCallbacks = [];  \r\n\t\t} else if (!(aiReadyCallbacks instanceof Array)) {\r\n\t\t\tvar aiReadyCallbacks = [];\r\n\t\t}    function aiShowIframeId(id_iframe) { jQuery(\"#\"+id_iframe).css(\"visibility\", \"visible\");    }    function aiResizeIframeHeight(height) { aiResizeIframeHeight(height,advanced_iframe); }    function aiResizeIframeHeightId(height,width,id) {aiResizeIframeHeightById(id,height);}</script><div id=\"ai-div-container-advanced_iframe\"><div id=\"ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-loader-icon\" src=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/plugins/advanced-iframe/img/loader.gif\" title=\"Loading\" alt=\"Loading\"></img></div><iframe id=\"advanced_iframe\"  name=\"advanced_iframe\"  src=\"https://archive.org/stream/devotions-for-the-daughters-of-israel-marcus-heinrich-bresslau-1852#page/n5/mode/2up\"  width=\"100%\"  height=\"900\"  frameborder=\"0\"  allowtransparency=\"true\"  loading=\"lazy\"  style=\";width:100%;height:900px;;width:1px;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;\"  allowfullscreen  onload='jQuery(&quot;#ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe&quot;).hide();;jQuery(&quot;#ai-div-loader-global&quot;).hide()' ></iframe></div><script type=\"text/javascript\">var ifrm_advanced_iframe = document.getElementById(\"advanced_iframe\");var hiddenTabsDoneadvanced_iframe = false;\r\nfunction resizeCallbackadvanced_iframe() {}var recalculateIframeResizeadvanced_iframe = 0;\r\n        var recalculateIframeOrientationchangeadvanced_iframe = 0;\r\n        var aiWindowWidth = 0;\r\n\t\tfunction recalculateIframeadvanced_iframe() {\r\n          clearTimeout(recalculateIframeResizeadvanced_iframe);\r\n          clearTimeout(recalculateIframeOrientationchangeadvanced_iframe);}  \r\n        function initResponsiveIframeadvanced_iframe() {\r\n          jQuery(window).resize(function() {\r\n\t\t\t recalculateIframeResizeadvanced_iframe = window.setTimeout(\"recalculateIframeadvanced_iframe()\",100);\r\n          });\r\n          if (window.addEventListener) {\r\n            window.addEventListener(\"orientationchange\", function() {\r\n               recalculateIframeOrientationchangeadvanced_iframe = window.setTimeout(\"recalculateIframeadvanced_iframe()\",100);\r\n            }, false);\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n        aiReadyCallbacks.push(initResponsiveIframeadvanced_iframe);</script><style>#advanced_iframe {width: 1px !important;min-width:100% !important;max-width:100% !important;}</style><script type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n<hr />\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\" style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">\n<blockquote><p>PREFACE. </p>\n<p>The want of some compendious form of Family Prayer in the vernacular for the females of our community, has been so long and strongly felt, that little apology is required for undertaking such a compilation in the true spirit of religious devotion, and with due regard to the existing recognised ritual service. The domestic position of females their numerous and arduous duties, particularly in married life and in reference to the physical and moral care of their children, render it a matter of great difficulty for them to recite all the prayers contained in the usual service with that undivided attention demanded by their solemnity; and this often leads to their being entirely neglected. Besides, many prayers which ought to be used on occasions incidental to female life, necessitate the avoidance of prolixity to enhance their soul stirring tendency. The <span class=\"hebrew\" lang=\"he\">תחינות</span> “Female Devotions,” of former times supplied this desideratum to a certain extent, and editions in a condensed form and corrected language appeared some years since in France, Germany, and Poland. These <span class=\"hebrew\" lang=\"he\">תחינות</span> met the approval of the most orthodox and conscientious continental Rabbies, being composed in conformity with traditional Judaism and chiefly extracted from Biblical and Talmudical writings, and yet adapted to the spirit of the age. </p>\n<p>The imperative necessity of retaining in any authorized Form of Prayers, the original and sacred language—the Hebrew—has been too strongly pronounced to allow infringement on its sanctity; yet in the case of Females a slight relaxation of that rule in so far as regards private devotions, cannot but be productive of beneficial effects: It is hoped, therefore, that as the object of this Publication is not to interfere with the regular order of Hebrew Prayers, but rather to strengthen the inclination to frequent devotion, the religious bearing of this small volume of “Devotions for the Daughters of Israel,” adapted from a Prayer Book in general use throughout Germany, will be correctly understood and duly appreciated. There can be no doubt that its general diffusion in Jewish families will strengthen that love for our Holy religion which forms the crown and glory of the Women of Israel. </p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>CONTENTS.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/?p=31991\">Prayer of Thanksgiving for Sunday</a><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=31997\">Prayer of Thanksgiving for Monday</a><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=32000\">Prayer of Thanksgiving for Tuesday</a><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=32017\">Prayer of Thanksgiving for Wednesday</a><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=32025\">Prayer of Thanksgiving for Thursday</a><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=32034\">Prayer of Thanksgiving for Friday</a><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=40774\">Daily Prayer against Temptation</a><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=32146\">Meditations on the Holy Sabbath</a><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=32043\">Prayer for the Sabbath</a><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=32049\">Prayer for the Sabbath Preceding New Moon</a><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=32052\">Prayer on New Moon</a><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=32056\">Meditations on the Life of Moses (for 7th Adar)</a><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=49401\">Prayer for the First Two Days of Passover</a><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=49406\">Prayer for the Last Two Days of Passover</a><br />\nPrayer for the Two Days of the Feast of Weeks (Pentecost)<br />\nPrayer for the Eve of the New Year<br />\nPrayer for the Two Days of the New Year<br />\nPrayer for the Eve of the Day of Atonement<br />\nPrayer for the Day of Atonement (Morning Service)<br />\nPrayer for the Day of Atonement (Additional Service)<br />\nPrayer for the Day of Atonement (Closing Service)<br />\n<a href=\"/?p=41012\">Prayer for the First Two Days of the Feast of Tabernacles</a><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=41008\">Prayer for the Seventh day of the Feast of Tabernacles </a> (<span class=\"hebrew\" lang=\"he\">הושענה רבה</span>)<br />\n<a href=\"/?p=41003\">Prayer for the Day of Solemn Assembly</a> (<span class=\"hebrew\" lang=\"he\">שמיני עצרת</span>)<br />\n<a href=\"/?p=40997\">Prayer for the Festival of Rejoicing in the Law</a> (<span class=\"hebrew\" lang=\"he\">שמחת תורה</span>)<br />\n<a href=\"/?p=40781\">Prayer in Memory of Departed Souls</a><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=40988\">Meditations on Immortality</a><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=32141\">Prayer for the Feast of Dedication</a><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=40894\">Prayer for the Feast of Purim</a><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=33013\">Prayer for the Fast of the 9th of Ab</a></p>\n<p><u>OCCASIONAL PRAYERS.</u><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=32065\">On a Birth-day</a><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=32069\">For Parents</a><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=32072\">On attaining the Age of Twelve (Initiation)</a><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=32075\">On becoming responsible as to Religious Duties</a><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=40814\">On the Day of Betrothal</a><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=40818\">On the Day of Marriage, previous to the Nuptial Ceremony</a><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=40822\">Of a Wife for her Husband</a><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=40878\">Of a Wife Previous to Confinement</a><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=40881\">Domestic Prayer of Thanksgiving after Confinement</a><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=40884\">On going to Synagogue after Confinement</a><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=32079\">On the day of Circumcision</a><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=40792\">On the day of Naming a New-born Daughter</a><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=32152\">For a Sick [Infant] Child</a><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=32143\">For a Sick Husband</a><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=32155\">In Sickness</a><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=32158\">Prayer of Thanksgiving on Recovering from Sickness</a><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=32164\">Of An Orphan</a><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=32178\">Of a Mother on the Grave of her Child </a><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=32183\">Of a Widow on the Grave of her Husband</a><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=32188\">For Salvation in the Future State</a><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=32192\">Resignation under Injuries</a><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=32195\">On the Grave of a Brother</a><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=32199\">On the Grave of a Sister</a><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=31987\">Morning Prayer</a><br />\n<a href=\"/?p=32060\">Night Prayer</a><br />\nPrayer for Thanksgiving after Meals<br />\n<a href=\"/?p=32202\">On the Anniversary of the Death of a Parent (Jahrzeit)</a>\n</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
