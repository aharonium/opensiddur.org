            "bio": "Yitsḥaḳ Yaakov (Jacob) Bosniak (also Bosnyak, 1887–1963) was an American Conservative rabbi. Bosniak was born in Russia, immigrated to the U.S. in 1903, and completed his rabbinical studies at the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Yeshivah, an Orthodox seminary, in 1907. In 1917, he was ordained at the Jewish Theological Seminary, where he earned a Doctor of Hebrew Letters in 1933. In 1921, after having served Congregation Shearith Israel in Dallas, Texas, he became rabbi of the Ocean Parkway Jewish Center in Brooklyn, n.y., a congregation he was to serve for 28 years. He was president of the Brooklyn Board of Rabbis (1938–40), chairman of the *Rabbinical Assembly's Rabbinic Ethics Committee (1945–48) and a judge (dayyan) and member of the Board of Directors of the Jewish Conciliation Board of America. Believing in the need for a uniform prayer book (siddur) with modern English translations, Bosniak published several prayer books that gained wide acceptance in Conservative synagogues. He edited <em>Prayers of Israel</em> (1925, 1937), <em>Likutei Tefilot: Public and Pulpit Prayers</em> (1927) and <em>Anthology of Prayer</em> (1958), prayer books that included English translations of Sabbath and Holiday prayers, English hymns, responsive readings, and instructions related to worship in English. In 1944, he published <em>Interpreting Jewish Life: The Sermons and Addresses of Jacob Bosniak</em>. Upon his retirement in 1949, Bosniak was elected rabbi emeritus and devoted his time to Jewish scholarship, publishing a critical edition of <em>The Commentary of David Kimhi on the Fifth Book of Psalms</em> (1954).",

The need for such a collection has long been felt. It has always been the custom in Israel to recite special prayers during the regular service, in other than the Hebrew language, as evidenced by the ancient prayers of <em>Brich Shemeh</em>, at the open ark, and <em>Yekum Purkan</em>, which are in the Aramaic, the vernacular of the people in olden times. It is, therefore, natural that these and similar prayers should now be recited in English. Then again, the Rabbi is very frequently called upon, to open or close important public functions with prayer. The composition of special prayers forms an important part of the Rabbi’s work; and it is our hope that this collection will facilitate his performance of this particular task. </p>\n<p>It is not our intention to produce a book of “ready-made” prayers to be read or recited by the minister in the pulpit or at a public function, though the volume contains a considerable number of prayers, like those of Chief Rabbi Dr. Joseph H. Hertz, Dr. Jaceb Kohn, Dr. Israel H. Levinthal, and others, that may be properly used in this manner. The main purpose of this volume is to guide and direct the minister in his efforts to write special prayers. For this reason we include a number of prayers which refer to, or make mention of special circumstances that might never again occur; they may merely be used as examples. </p>\n<p>Our grateful acknowledgement is due to the Rabbis, who responded to our letter, and sent in their contributions to this volume. </p>\n<p>Jacob Bosniak.<br />\nBrooklyn , N.Y.<br />\nEllul 5687—1927. </p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
