He assisted Rabbi Simeon Singer in preparing the Authorised Prayer Book in 1890. He was a significant figure in the contexts of modern Jewish religious thought, Jewish-Christian relations, and Anglo-Jewish socio-politics, and educator. Montefiore was President of the Anglo-Jewish Association and an influential anti-Zionist leader, who co-founded the anti-Zionist League of British Jews in 1917.",

He is best known for his English translation of the Siddur, the Authorized Daily Prayer Book, informally known as the \"Singer's Siddur\". Singer's most famous work was his new edition and English translation of the Authorized Daily Prayer Book (published in 1890). The Siddur was expanded in 1917 under Chief Rabbi Joseph Hertz. In 1915 the Bloch Publishing Company published an American version, The Standard Prayer Book, which was widely used until the introduction of Philip Birnbaum's Ha-Siddur Ha-Shalem in 1949.",

Until the age of 15, she was educated at Doreck College, and privately educated thereafter. In 1893 she founded with Emily Marion Harris the West Central Jewish Girls Club (which subsequently merged into the Jewish Girls' Brigade). She was active in social improvement, particularly in respect to unemployment, sweat shops and bad housing. In 1901 and 1902, Montagu laid the groundwork for the establishment of the Jewish Religious Union in London. In February 1902 she arranged the first meeting of the Jewish Religious Union for the Advancement of Liberal Judaism at her sister Henrietta Franklin's house. The Union set up the first synagogue in Liberal Judaism in the UK and helped found the World Union for Progressive Judaism. Montagu was a founding member with her sister of the Jewish League for Woman Suffrage. She sat on the executive committee and led the meetings in prayer. Following the retirement of Leo Baeck, Montagu served for a brief stint (1955â€“1959) in her 80s as president of the World Union for Progressive Judaism, before handing the reins over to Solomon Freehof.",

It is, however, considerably larger, and will, it is hoped, be found more adequate for the needs of worshippers at the Services of the Jewish Religious Union. For a number of metrical versions or paraphrases of Psalms, the Committee are indebted to Mrs. Henry Lucas, who has also permitted them to make further selections from her &#8220;Jewish Year.&#8221; Both in the prose and metrical portions of the book, considerable use has been made of the liturgical poems of Jehuda ha-Levi. Most of the prayers now added are derived or adapted from the traditional Jewish Liturgy, but a few have been specially written for the Services of the Union.\n</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
