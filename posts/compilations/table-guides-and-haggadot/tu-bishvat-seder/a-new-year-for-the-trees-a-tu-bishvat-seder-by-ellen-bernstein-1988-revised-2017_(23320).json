In 1988, she founded Shomrei Adamah (Keepers of the Earth), the first national Jewish environmental organization. Shomrei Adamah grew organically out of an  ecologically-centered arts and music seder for Tu Bishvat that she organized in Philadelphia along the banks of the Schuylkill River. Around then, she also sponsored Rabbi Miles Krassen in making the first English translation of the original Tu Bishvat seder haggadah, the <em>Pri Ets Hadar</em>. In 2012, she was ordained at the Academy for Jewish Religion. Besides authoring her own Tu Bishvat haggadah, she wrote <em>Ecology &amp; the Jewish Spirit: Where Nature &amp; the Sacred Meet</em> (2000), <em>The Splendor of Creation: A Biblical Ecology</em> (2005), and <em>The Promise of the Land</em> (2020).",

Literally it means the 15th of the month of Sh’vat (which also means branches).\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nWhen many of us hear the word ‘seder,’ we think ‘Passover.’ The word seder literally means order, and the Passover seder is an orderly ritual.  Why a seder for Tu BiShvat?  Because a seder refers to any ordered ritual that can make an abstract idea tangible and even edible.  On Passover, we don’t just recite the story of liberation and call it a night.  We participate in an elaborate ritual meal to remind us of the journey from bondage to freedom, and we feel it in our bodies.  We become slaves as we eat foods that symbolize slavery.  Matzah represents our poverty; horseradish, our bitterness;  haroset, our occupation as brick layers.  We become free as we eat a lavish feast and drink 4 cups of wine in the style of free people—reclining.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nThe Tu BiShvat seder is also a ritual that makes an idea tangible and edible. The idea is that God is the source of life—of the extraordinary diversity and richness of the natural world, and it is humanity’s job to help fix the world.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nThe Tu BiShvat seder has its own order which is based on the symbolism of the Kabbalists, mystics from Safed in medieval Israel. They perceived the universe and our individual universes (our lives) to be structured according to 4 worlds: Assiyah, the physical world of doing, Yetzirah, the emotional world of being/creating, Briyah, the intellectual world of thinking, and Atzilut, the spiritual world of transcending.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nThe journey of this seder is personal and spiritual. We begin in Assiyah, the material world in which we live—a world of extraordinary variety of color, taste, forms, and sounds—and travel upward (and inward) through the unseen worlds of Yetzirah and Briyah, to the place of Atzilut, the world where all is One. You can imagine the journey as one of pulling back veils or passing through gates. Some Jewish mystics intuited a correspondence between these 4 worlds and the 4 elemental worlds of Earth, Water, Air and Fire. This seder, A New Year for the Trees, is based on this correspondence. Like the Kabbalists, we experience the journey of the 4 worlds by reading from our sacred texts and reflecting on the structure and essence of nature and our nature. And we ingest this journey, making it even more real, as we eat and drink of the specific fruits and wines symbolic of the 4 worlds.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nThe idea of fixing the world (tikkun) through our blessing is a central theme of the seder.  The Kabbalists believed that before Adam ate the apple in the Garden, the world was whole.  Creation was one with Creator, and peace and harmony prevailed.  Then Adam rebelled against God by eating the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nThe P’ri Etz Hadar states: </p>\n<p>Do not eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, for on the day that you eat of it, you will surely die (Gen. 2:17). By eating from the tree of knowledge [Adam] changed the King’ s laws. [He] abandoned the tree of life in which everything is perfect and upon which faith depends.\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nAdam’s trespass shattered the soul of the world. All of creation became separated from the Creator and humanity separated from nature.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nFrom the kabbalistic point of view, Adam’s transgression testifies to the awesome power that humanity holds. It is humanity that is primarily responsible for the state of nature and the cosmos. Just as humanity holds the capacity to spoil the Creation, humanity also holds the possibility to heal and restore it. The world becomes whole when people take seriously the divine law and the obligation to fix the world.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nIn the kabbalistic vision, our expressions of gratitude, our blessings, are the critical link to the repair of the world. How can blessings heal?  In at least two ways:\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nAccording to the Kabbalists,, nature’s well-being is largely dependent on our kavvanot—the intentions that we hold in our hearts and express in our blessings before partaking of nature’s bounty. In their worldview, the simple act of eating a fruit depletes the plant of the fruit’s divine energy. We can restore the energy by offering a blessing. The plant’s guardian angel channels the blessing back to the specific plant, enabling the plant to bear fruit again. Without our blessings, the angel cannot replenish the energy and the plant cannot produce a second generation of fruit. When we neglect the blessings, we fail to fulfil our obligation as creative agents in the Creation. We are like robbers, stealing the divine energy from the plant.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nBlessings can also change us. When we recite a blessing, we subliminally train ourselves to appreciate the gift (the bread, the wine, the rain) that we have been given. The power of this simple act can not be overestimated. We tend to take nature for granted. We have grown to expect that the world is ours to use for our individual gain. We feel entitled to nature’s gifts and live lives of thoughtless consuming. Our souls are poorer for our inability to wonder, and nature suffers on account of our endless need to claim her for ourselves.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nIt requires a tremendous amount of focus and perseverance to maintain the vision that the world is holy and that our actions towards it matter. Just as we need to practice to learn to play the piano or to speak a new language, we need to practice to learn how to value and treat nature. Blessings are the spiritual practice that can help us to live as sacred guardians of Creation. This practice can help us to care for nature as we care for our souls.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nOn Tu BiShvat then, our intention is to heal the rift between human and nature that occurred ‘in the beginning’ with Adam’s first act of separation. Just as Adam partook of the tree that God proclaimed was off-limits to him, so we in every generation, invariably overstep our bounds, and partake of that which is not ours. Our blessings on Tu BiShvat have the power to in.uence the world when we recite them with sincere intention. We eat as many kinds of fruit as we can because each new and different kind of fruit is an opportunity for another blessing. The more fruits, the more blessing, the more we can help repair ourselves and the world.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\n<h3>4 Worlds</h3>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nThe 4 worlds and the 4 cups form the organizing principle for A New Year for the Trees.
