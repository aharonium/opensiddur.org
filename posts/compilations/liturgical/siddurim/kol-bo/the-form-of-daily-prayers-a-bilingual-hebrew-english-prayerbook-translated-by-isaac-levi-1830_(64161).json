            "bio": "Isaac Levi (Heb: ר׳ יצחק ב״ר עקיבא | Rabbi Yitsḥaq ben Rabbi Akiva) (ca. 1770? -1839) was a teacher of Hebrew, pioneering English translator of Jewish liturgy, and an erudite Jewish scholar in England at the turn of the 19th century. Little is known of his life save that he prepared \"revised\" English translations of the haggadah and maḥzorim compiled by David Levi (no relation). As with David Levi his publications served as the basis for haggadot, siddurim, and maḥzorim published by others. On title pages, he is sometimes listed as a \"professor and teacher of the Hebrew language.\" As he was not appointed to any university, this likely means that he taught or tutored Christian Hebraists and other interested students. Details provided to Avraham Roos by Henry Roche indicate that he left the publishing world in the mid-1830s to work as a Hebraist responsible for the Hebrew manuscripts in the library of Prince Augustus Frederick, H.R.H. Duke of Sussex. Roos notes that Isaac's use of the word ענגלאטירא ('English') attests to French influence. Roche notes that despite his surname Levi, Isaac was not a Levite. With his wife Esther, Isaac had five children. We know that over the course of his life he spent time in London and Portsmouth. Roos speculates that the likely cause of Isaac Levi's name being left off of works by David Levi that the former had amended, was probably due to a commercial dispute in the early 1830s with the printer Hyam Barnett (c. 1763–1845).  Isaac Levi's date of birth is not yet known, but we can surmise it to be in the mid- to late 18th century. If you know any more about Isaac Levi's life and career, please <a href=\"/contact/\">contact us</a>. (Many thanks to Avraham Roos and Henry Roche for the details so far discovered.)",

    "content": "<p>Isaac Levi&#8217;s <em>The Form of Daily Prayers according to the custom of the German and Polish Jews</em> (London: M. Phillips, 1830) is a daily, shabbat, and festival prayerbook. Historically, it can be thought of as one of the second generation of bilingual Ashkenazi Hebrew-English prayerbooks published in Britain. (The first generation being those produced by A. Alexander and David Levi.) Often, probably for marketing reasons, these then novel editions would rather conservatively refer to themselves as revised or corrected, knowing that the esteem given to the earlier prayerbooks of David Levi might argue against any new siddur with a new translation.</p>\n<style>\n       .errordiv { padding:10px; margin:10px; border: 1px solid #555555;color: #000000;background-color: #f8f8f8; width:500px; }#advanced_iframe {visibility:visible;opacity:1;vertical-align:top;}.ai-info-bottom-iframe { position: fixed; z-index: 10000; bottom:0; left: 0; margin: 0px; text-align: center; width: 100%; background-color: #ff9999; padding-left: 5px;padding-bottom: 5px; border-top: 1px solid #aaa } a.ai-bold {font-weight: bold;}#ai-layer-div-advanced_iframe p {height:100%;margin:0;padding:0}#ai-div-container-advanced_iframe\n       {\n           position: relative;\n           width: 100%; max-width: 100%;}\n       #ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe\n       {\n          position: absolute;\n          z-index:1000;\n          margin-left:-33px;\n          left: 50%;   top: 150px;\n         }}\n       #ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe img\n       {\n          border: none;\n       }</style><script type=\"text/javascript\">var ai_iframe_width_advanced_iframe = 0;var ai_iframe_height_advanced_iframe = 0;var aiIsIe8=false;var aiOnloadScrollTop=\"true\";var aiShowDebug=false;\n\t\tif (typeof aiReadyCallbacks === 'undefined') {\n\t\t\tvar aiReadyCallbacks = [];\n\t\t} else if (!(aiReadyCallbacks instanceof Array)) {\n\t\t\tvar aiReadyCallbacks = [];\n\t\t}    function aiShowIframeId(id_iframe) { jQuery(\"#\"+id_iframe).css(\"visibility\", \"visible\");    }    function aiResizeIframeHeight(height) { aiResizeIframeHeight(height,advanced_iframe); }    function aiResizeIframeHeightId(height,width,id) {aiResizeIframeHeightById(id,height);}</script><div id=\"ai-div-container-advanced_iframe\"><div id=\"ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-loader-icon\" src=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/plugins/advanced-iframe/img/loader.gif\" title=\"Loading\" alt=\"Loading\" /></div><iframe id=\"advanced_iframe\"  name=\"advanced_iframe\"  src=\"https://archive.org/stream/the-form-of-daily-prayers-ashkenaz-isaac-levi-1830/The%20Form%20of%20Daily%20Prayers%20%5BAshkenaz%5D%20%28Isaac%20Levi%201830%29#page/n0/mode/2up\"  width=\"100%\"  height=\"900\"  frameborder=\"0\"  border=\"0\"  allowtransparency=\"true\"  loading=\"lazy\"  style=\";width:100%;height:900px;;width:1px;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;\"  allowfullscreen  onload='jQuery(&quot;#ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe&quot;).hide();;jQuery(&quot;#ai-div-loader-global&quot;).hide()' ></iframe></div><script type=\"text/javascript\">var ifrm_advanced_iframe = document.getElementById(\"advanced_iframe\");var hiddenTabsDoneadvanced_iframe = false;\nfunction resizeCallbackadvanced_iframe() {}var recalculateIframeResizeadvanced_iframe = 0;\n        var recalculateIframeOrientationchangeadvanced_iframe = 0;\n        var aiWindowWidth = 0;\n\t\tfunction recalculateIframeadvanced_iframe() {\n          clearTimeout(recalculateIframeResizeadvanced_iframe);\n          clearTimeout(recalculateIframeOrientationchangeadvanced_iframe);}\n        function initResponsiveIframeadvanced_iframe() {\n          jQuery(window).resize(function() {\n\t\t\t recalculateIframeResizeadvanced_iframe = window.setTimeout(\"recalculateIframeadvanced_iframe()\",100);\n          });\n          if (window.addEventListener) {\n            window.addEventListener(\"orientationchange\", function() {\n               recalculateIframeOrientationchangeadvanced_iframe = window.setTimeout(\"recalculateIframeadvanced_iframe()\",100);\n            }, false);\n          }\n        }\n        aiReadyCallbacks.push(initResponsiveIframeadvanced_iframe);</script><style>#advanced_iframe {width: 1px !important;min-width:100% !important;max-width:100% !important;}</style><script type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n<p>This work is in the Public Domain due to its having been published more than 95 years ago.</p>\n<p>This digital edition was prepared by Aharon Varady from page images of an item held in the collection of the HUC-JIR Klau library, Cincinnati.
