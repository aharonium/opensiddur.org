            "bio": "Benjamin Szold (November 15, 1829 in Nemeskürt, Nyitra County, Kingdom of Hungary, (today Slovakia) – July 31, 1902 in Berkeley Springs, West Virginia) was an American rabbi and scholar.  Szold studied under Rabbis Jacob Fischer of Shalgaw, Wolf Kollin of Werbau, and Benjamin Wolf at the Pressburg Yeshiva, and received the rabbinical authorization from Judah Assod of Bur and Simon Sidon of Tyrnau. In 1848, he studied in Vienna, but when the revolution of that year broke out he went to Pressburg. From 1849 to 1855 he tutored in private families in Hungary, and in the latter year entered the University of Breslau, where he remained until 1858. While a student he officiated during the holy days at Brieg, Silesia (1857), and at Stockholm, Sweden (1858). In 1859, he accepted a call from the Temple Oheb Shalom (Baltimore, Maryland) in whose service he remained until his death, first as rabbi and later (after 1892) as rabbi emeritus.  Under his guidance it grew rapidly, and, actuated by his example, it became widely known for its strict observance of Shabbat. Before Szold's arrival the congregation had adopted for use in its Shabbat service the Minhag America, (which was the new prayer-book written by Isaac Meyer Wise, a Reform rabbi) on the great fall holy days it reverted to the Minhag Ashkenaz; after much discussion with his congregation Szold introduced a new prayer-book, Abodat Yisrael, which closely followed traditional lines.",

            "bio": "Marcus Jastrow (June 5, 1829, Rogoźno – October 13, 1903) was a Polish-born American Talmudic scholar, most famously known for his authorship of the popular and comprehensive <em>A Dictionary of the Targumim, Talmud Babli, Talmud Yerushalmi and Midrashic Literature</em>. He was also a progressive, early reformist rabbi in America. Along with Benjamin Szold and Frederick de Sola Mendes, Marcus Jastrow was characterized by Jewish historian Jacob Rader Marcus as being on the right-wing of early American Reform. His translation of Rabbi Benjamin Szold's prayerbook into English offered a more traditional alternative to the <em>Minhag America</em> prayerbook of Isaac M. Wise. He opposed the 1885 Pittsburgh Platform, but consented for an organ to be installed in his Rodeph Shalom synagogue in Philadelphia.",

Dr. B. Szold both in arrangement and in text, so that either of them may be used in Divine Service while the prayers are read, or the hymns sung, in Hebrew, English or German. </p>\n<p>As in the German, so in this edition, the method of a literal translation of the Hebrew prayers has been disregarded, and in lieu thereof a paraphrase chosen which renders the spirit of each prayer without burdening it with Oriental phraseology. By so doing, the Editor thinks, he has furnished an available Prayer Book for those who are not familial with the Hebrew language. </p>\n<p>The poetical pieces in this Book being, however, monuments of of Hebrew poetry, have been rendered in verse, in imitation of the style of each poem either in meter or without, so as to give the reader an approximate idea of the Hebrew poetry of the Middle Ages. </p>\n<p>In the thorough revision of the prosaic parts contained in the Book, the Editor acknowledges the aid of other hands, so that there might be spared no painstaking to make the style easy and smooth. </p>\n<p>The following valuable renditions of poetical writings have been contributed by a friend and colleague: &#8220;O God whose grace,&#8221; pp. 342, 421, and 465; &#8220;Lord, thy people,&#8221; p. 425; &#8220;From thee my praise,&#8221; p. 467; &#8220;O God, to thee,&#8221; p. 491; and the Hoshaanoth, p. 581 to p. 583, for which contributions, the Editor avails himself of this opportunity to express his sincerest thanks. </p>\n<p>The metrical translations of the Psalms in the Prayer Book (pp. 2, 15, and 50 to 56) are, with some alterations, taken from <em><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/psalmsofdavidren00jone\">The Psalms of David by Abner Jones</a></em>. </p>\n<p>As to the <a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/compilations/anthologies/songs-and-prayers-and-meditations-for-divine-services-of-israelites-arranged-by-benjamin-szold-and-translated-by-marcus-jastrow-1873/\">Songs for Divine Services</a> hereto attached, No. 17 is from Addison with some modifications, and No. 138 written by a friend. With a few exceptions the songs agree in meter with those of the German edition, so that the same melodies are adaptable for both. </p>\n<p>For the remainder of the Psalms and Hymns, both in the Hymn and the Prayer Book, and for the translations of the Hebrew poems, the Editor, though with timidity, takes the responsibility upon himself alone, looking forward for a kind reception by the public for whom the book is intended. </p>\n<p>M. J.<br />\nPhiladelphia, Adar 12th 5633.<br />\n(March 10th 1873.)\n</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
