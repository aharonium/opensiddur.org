            "bio": "The National Jewish Welfare Board (JWB) was formed on April 9, 1917, three days after the United States declared war on Germany, in order to support Jewish soldiers in the U.S. military during World War Ⅰ. The impetus for creating the organization stemmed from Secretary of War, Newton Baker and Secretary of Navy, Josephus Daniels. The organization was also charged with recruiting and training rabbis for military service, as well as providing support materials to these newly commissioned chaplains. The JWB also maintained oversight of Jewish chapel facilities at military installations. In 1921, several organizations merged with the JWB to become a national association of Jewish community centers around the country in order to integrate social activities, education, and active recreation. These merged organizations included the YWHA, YMHA, and the National Council of Young Men's Hebrew and Kindred Association. In 1941, in a response to a mandate from President Franklin D. Roosevelt, six private organizations - the National Jewish Welfare Board, the YMCA, YWCA, the Traveler's Aid Association, and the Salvation Army - were challenged to handle the on-leave morale and recreational needs for members of the Armed Forces.  On 4 February 1941, the six organizations pooled their resources and founded the <a href=\"https://www.uso.org\">United Service Organizations</a> (USO). The National Jewish Welfare Board is now the <a href=\"https://jcca.org/signature-programs-and-events/jwb\">JWB Jewish Chaplains Council</a>, part of Jewish Community Centers (JCC) of North America. The JWB Jewish Chaplains Council sends prayer books, religious artifacts and supplies for Jewish holidays, including Passover Seder kits, Ḥanukkah candles, four species for Sukkot, and more.",

The Jewish Publication Society of America offered to publish an abridged Prayer Book for these men if an agreement as to the text could be reached. A committee of three was formed, consisting of Dr. Cyrus Adler, representing the United Synagogue of America, Dr. William Rosenau, representing the Central Conference of American Rabbis, and Dr. Bernard Drachman, representing the Union of Orthodox Congregations. The present volume has been prepared under their direction. </p>\n<p>The Hebrew text and English translation of <a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/compilations/liturgical/siddurim/kol-bo/the-authorised-daily-prayer-book-aka-the-singer-siddur/\">Singer’s Prayer Book</a> have been followed, except that all extracts from the Bible have been made to conform to the new translation issued by the Jewish Publication Society of America. Passages omitted in the Union Prayer Book issued by the Central Conference of American Rabbis have been indicated by a star. In cases where part of a paragraph is omitted, a star is also placed at the end of that part. </p>\n<p>The festival services are adopted from the “Prayer Book for Jewish Sailors and Soldiers” prepared for the British Navy and Army. </p>\n<p>This volume, which, it is hoped, may prove of strength and comfort to our young men offering their lives in the noble cause for which America has entered the war, is not intended in any way to supersede existing books of prayer, and is designed solely for the emergency for which it is being published. </p>\n<p>Philadelphia<br />\nAugust, 1917<br />\nElul, 5677 </p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
