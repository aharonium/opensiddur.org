            "bio": "Hyman Alter Segal (חיים אלטר סג״ל; 1896-1970)  was an editor for the Hebrew Publishing Company from the 1920s till the day of his death on 1 January 1970. He was acknowledged by Paltiel Birnbaum among the editors of <em>Ha-Siddur Ha-Shalem</em> (1949). Segal arranged the <em>Siddur Tifereth David</em> (1951), containing the first English translation of a \"Sefard\" (Ḥasidic) prayerbook for American Jewry. In 1955, HPB published the maḥzor he compiled for Rosh haShanah and Yom Kippur, <em>Maḥzor Ḳol Yisrael</em>. HPB also published a luaḥ (date calendar) he arranged for the years 1960-2116. Born in Hungary, he made his way sometime in the 1910s to Erets Yisrael where he studied in the yeshivah of Rav Quq and married Sheyna Rabinowitz. In the early 1920s, he came to the United States where he began working for the Hebrew Publishing Company. In 1962, he was assaulted in Crown Heights and left in a coma for five days before recovering. He is remembered with love by his grandchildren. (We would like to know more about Hyman Alter Segal.

Occupying a former bank building on Delancey Street in Manhattan’s Lower East Side until the mid 1970s, the company remained owned by the Werbelowsky family (later shortened to Werbel) until 1980 when it was sold to Charles Lieber (1921-2016). During its first eighty years, the publishing house grew to become one of the most prominent publishing houses for Jewish books and sheet music.",

    "excerpt": "The first nusaḥ ha-ARI z\"l (\"Sefardic-Ḥassidic\") prayerbook with a relatively complete English translation, published in 1951 by the Hebrew Publishing Company. . . .",
    "content": "<p><em>Siddur Tifereth David</em> (1951), arranged by Ḥayyim (Hyman) Alter Segal, was the first nusaḥ ha-ARI z&#8221;l (&#8220;Sephardic-Ḥassidic&#8221;) prayerbook with a relatively complete English translation.</p>\n<p>In 1912, the Hebrew Publishing company had published the <em>Siddur Tiferet Yehudah</em> by Abraham Ḥayyim (Hyman) Charlap (1862-1916) in both nusaḥ Ashkenaz and &#8220;sfard&#8221; editions which were reprinted over the next several decades.  Indeed, if one compares prayerbooks, Segal&#8217;s <em>Tifereth David</em> essentially adds its English translation opposite the Hebrew pages of the <em>Tiferet Yehudah</em> siddur.</p>\n<p>A review of the English translation indicates reticence to publish translations of works from the Zohar or Tiqunei Zohar. Pataḥ Eliyahu is left untranslated. &#8220;K&#8217;Gavneh&#8221; from the Zohar on Parashat Terumah, read before ma&#8217;ariv after Kabbalat Shabbat is entirely missing. While kavanot are translated, references to the shekhinah are omitted. For an example, see the translation of the kavvanah preceding laying tefilin on page 2.</p>\n<p>We are not certain whether the English translation in the <em>Tifereth David</em> was made by Segal, an unattributed translator, or a team of translators. (Segal was an editor for the Hebrew Publishing Company at the time, a detail we know thanks to an acknowledgement given to him in Paltiel Birnbaum&#8217;s introduction to his 1949 siddur, <em><a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/compilations/kol-bo/ha-siddur-ha-shalem-by-paltiel-birnbaum-1949/\">Ha-Siddur Ha-Shalem</a></em>, also published by the Hebrew Publishing Company.)</p>\n<p>&#8220;Sephardic&#8221; here does not refer to the liturgical custom of the Sepharadim, but rather to the liturgical custom of the ḥasidim who followed the school of Lurianic Kabbalah (a/k/a the nusaḥ ha-ARI z&#8221;l). Non-ḥasidic Jews referred to this &#8220;new&#8221; liturgical custom as &#8220;Sephardic&#8221; as it contained some liturgical customs familiar to some branches of the sepharadi diaspora. The term stuck and has been a familiar source of confusion for newcomers to Jewish prayer ever since.</p>\n<style>\n       .errordiv { padding:10px; margin:10px; border: 1px solid #555555;color: #000000;background-color: #f8f8f8; width:500px; }#advanced_iframe {visibility:visible;opacity:1;vertical-align:top;}.ai-info-bottom-iframe { position: fixed; z-index: 10000; bottom:0; left: 0; margin: 0px; text-align: center; width: 100%; background-color: #ff9999; padding-left: 5px;padding-bottom: 5px; border-top: 1px solid #aaa } a.ai-bold {font-weight: bold;}#ai-layer-div-advanced_iframe p {height:100%;margin:0;padding:0}#ai-div-container-advanced_iframe\n       {\n           position: relative;\n           width: 100%; max-width: 100%;}\n       #ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe\n       {\n          position: absolute;\n          z-index:1000;\n          margin-left:-33px;\n          left: 50%;   top: 150px;\n         }}\n       #ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe img\n       {\n          border: none;\n       }</style><script type=\"text/javascript\">var ai_iframe_width_advanced_iframe = 0;var ai_iframe_height_advanced_iframe = 0;var aiIsIe8=false;var aiOnloadScrollTop=\"true\";var aiShowDebug=false;\n\t\tif (typeof aiReadyCallbacks === 'undefined') {\n\t\t\tvar aiReadyCallbacks = [];\n\t\t} else if (!(aiReadyCallbacks instanceof Array)) {\n\t\t\tvar aiReadyCallbacks = [];\n\t\t}    function aiShowIframeId(id_iframe) { jQuery(\"#\"+id_iframe).css(\"visibility\", \"visible\");    }    function aiResizeIframeHeight(height) { aiResizeIframeHeight(height,advanced_iframe); }    function aiResizeIframeHeightId(height,width,id) {aiResizeIframeHeightById(id,height);}</script><div id=\"ai-div-container-advanced_iframe\"><div id=\"ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-loader-icon\" src=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/plugins/advanced-iframe/img/loader.gif\" title=\"Loading\" alt=\"Loading\" /></div><iframe id=\"advanced_iframe\"  name=\"advanced_iframe\"  src=\"https://www.archive.org/stream/siddurtiferethdavidsefardhymanaltersegal1951#page/n02/mode/2up\"  width=\"100%\"  height=\"900\"  frameborder=\"0\"  border=\"0\"  allowtransparency=\"true\"  loading=\"lazy\"  style=\";width:100%;height:900px;;width:1px;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;\"  allowfullscreen  onload='jQuery(&quot;#ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe&quot;).hide();;jQuery(&quot;#ai-div-loader-global&quot;).hide()' ></iframe></div><script type=\"text/javascript\">var ifrm_advanced_iframe = document.getElementById(\"advanced_iframe\");var hiddenTabsDoneadvanced_iframe = false;\nfunction resizeCallbackadvanced_iframe() {}var recalculateIframeResizeadvanced_iframe = 0;\n        var recalculateIframeOrientationchangeadvanced_iframe = 0;\n        var aiWindowWidth = 0;\n\t\tfunction recalculateIframeadvanced_iframe() {\n          clearTimeout(recalculateIframeResizeadvanced_iframe);\n          clearTimeout(recalculateIframeOrientationchangeadvanced_iframe);}\n        function initResponsiveIframeadvanced_iframe() {\n          jQuery(window).resize(function() {\n\t\t\t recalculateIframeResizeadvanced_iframe = window.setTimeout(\"recalculateIframeadvanced_iframe()\",100);\n          });\n          if (window.addEventListener) {\n            window.addEventListener(\"orientationchange\", function() {\n               recalculateIframeOrientationchangeadvanced_iframe = window.setTimeout(\"recalculateIframeadvanced_iframe()\",100);\n            }, false);\n          }\n        }\n        aiReadyCallbacks.push(initResponsiveIframeadvanced_iframe);</script><style>#advanced_iframe {width: 1px !important;min-width:100% !important;max-width:100% !important;}</style><script type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n<p>This work is in the Public Domain due to the lack of a copyright renewal by the copyright holder listed in the copyright notice (a condition required for works published in the United States between January 1st 1924 and January 1st 1964).</p>\n<p>This work was scanned by Aharon Varady for the Open Siddur Project from a volume held in the collection of the HUC Klau Library, Cincinnati, Ohio.

There has been a serious need for a Sephardic[-Ḥassidic] Daily Prayer Book with an English translation for many years and it is hoped that Jews who observe the traditional Sephardic[-Ḥassidic] services will find this English version an essential and important book for daily and Sabbath worship. </p>\n<p>This volume also includes prayers for additional services as are found in other complete Siddurim in the Ashkenazic service. </p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
