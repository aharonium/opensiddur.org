            "bio": "Yosef ben Yuzl Mogilntski (also Magilntski and Magilntzky, Americanized: Joseph Magil, March 17, 1870-February 10, 1945) was born in Raseyn (Raseiniai), Kovno district, Lithuania.  Until age fourteen he attended religious elementary schools and yeshivas, while stealthily studying modern Hebrew and Russian.  At age sixteen he published essays in <em>Hamelits</em> (The spectator) and <em>Yudishe folksblat</em> (Jewish people’s newspaper).  In 1889 he moved to Mitave (Mitava), Courland.  There he studied German and acquainted himself with German literature.  In 1890 he returned to Raseiniai and became a teacher in the school for the society “Banot Tsiyon” (Daughters of Zion).  In 1892 he made his way to the United States, settled in Philadelphia, and founded there a Hebrew-Yiddish school called “Bene Tsiyon” (Children of Zion).  In 1894 he founded in Philadelphia <em>Yudishes folks blat</em> (Jewish people’s newspaper), a biweekly published by the Mogilnitski Brothers and edited by Yoysef Mogilnitski, which came out for approximately one year.  He also published articles in <em>Der literarishe shtrahl</em> (The literary ray [of light]), “monthly with an English division”—motto: “Literature and Science”—in Philadelphia, first volume (September 1899), last issue (February 1906).  He also wrote (using the pen name “A. Mogil”) for <em>Nyu-yorker yudishe folks-tsaytung</em> (New York Jewish people’s newspaper) (1886-1889) and other publications.  He published textbooks for schools and Talmud-Torahs (in Yiddish with English translation), including: <em>Mogilnitskis linyen skul khumesh, oder oyzer hamore vehatalmid (dem lehers un shilers hehilfe)</em> (Mogilnitski’s linear school Pentateuch, or an aide for the teacher and the student), “an entirely new and easy method of instruction in the entire Pentateuch, without change or abridgement, with great success, with assistance from a new ‘linear system,’ for [secular] schools, religious elementary schools, Talmud-Torahs, and self-study” (Philadelphia, 1899); <em>Mogilnitskis hamekhin lakhumesh</em> (Mogilnitski’s preparation for Pentateuch [study]) (Philadelphia, 1906), 199 pp.; <em>Mogilnitskis linyen megiles ester</em> (Mogilnitski’s linear Scroll of Esther) (Philadelphia); <em>Mogilnitskis hagode shel peysekh</em> (Mogilnitski’s Passover Haggada); <em>Mogilnitskis kovets shire tsien veshire am</em> (Mogilnitski’s collection of poems of Zion and poetry of the people) (Philadelphia, 1906), “fifty-six of the best poems in Hebrew, Yiddish, and English, with notes to sing and play in pocketbook format.”  He also published: <em>Sider lebote-seyfer velam</em> (Prayer book for schools and the people) (Philadelphia, 1904), 176 pp., “complete prayer book for the entire year, all of the prayers all in one place, for every Jewish home, religious elementary schools, and schools, with important remarks and special notes by means of which everyone can know where one finds the two kinds of shva, by Yoysef son of Yude Mogilnitski.”  He died in Philadelphia.

For instance <span class=\"hebrew\">קִ־דְּשָֽׁנוּ, וּ־תְנוּמָה</span> are to be read <span class=\"hebrew\">קִדְּֿשָֽׁנוּ, וּתְֿנוּמָה</span> i.e., the letter having the dash (<span class=\"hebrew\">ֿ</span>) placed over it begins the following syllable. </p>\n<p>To designate words wherein the penultimate syllable is to be accented, the Metheg-sign (<sub>׀</sub>) has been made use of throughout this book, as <span class=\"hebrew\">לְפָנֶֽיךָ, מֶֽלֶךְ</span>. In words not having such a sign the ultimate syllable is to be accented. </p>\n<p>HOW TO STUDY MAGIL’S UNEAR BOOKS SUCCESSFULLY. </p>\n<p>Cover the column of translation up to the line you intend to study by the “Student’s Cover” which is attached to this book, or, in absence of such a cover, by an ordinary straight piece of card-board or paper. Read one line of the Hebrew text and the translation thereof very slowly and carefully once, twice, or more, until you think you know the translation by heart, and are able to repeat the same precisely, without looking into the book. Then move the cover upward , so as to cover the translation of the Hebrew line which is being studied, read again the Hebrew line, and furnish the translation yourself; then move the cover downward again, read the translation inside , and compare it with that which you furnished. When found to be correct, read and translate it several times until well memorized. Continue to do the same with the following lines, and, when a passage is thus memorized, it should be gone over again, but this time you must first cover the translation and furnish the same yourself, bearing always in mind that whenever you had yourself translated a line, you must not leave it before the cover was moved downward and the translation verified. </p>\n<p>Apply the Student’s Cover to the text in making translations from English into Hebrew, just as you have been directed to apply it to the English translation in translating from Hebrew into English. </p>\n<p>In reciting a lesson before the teacher, the student should keep covered the translation.\n</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
