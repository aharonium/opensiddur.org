            "bio": "Seligman (Isaac) Baer was a masoretic scholar, and an editor of the Hebrew Bible and of Jewish liturgy. He was born in Mosbach, the northern district of Biebrich, Sept. 18, 1825 and died at Biebrich-on-the-Rhine, March, 1897. He belonged to the school of Wolf Heidenheim, and had in his possession some of Heidenheim's original manuscripts and personal copies of his published works with handwritten marginal notes. Baer's monumental edition of the Jewish prayerbook according to the Ashkenazic rite, Seder Avodat Yisrael (Rödelheim, 1868), accompanied by a critical commentary, became the authoritative model for numerous editions published subsequently in the 20th century. His editions of the Jewish liturgy also include Kinnot for the fast of the ninth of Av. He never occupied an academic position, but was content with the office of Hebrew teacher to the Jewish community of Biebrich. In recognition of his services to the Commission for the History of the Jews in Germany, the honorary degree of doctor of philosophy was conferred upon him by the University of Leipzig.",

The edition we are transcribing is from 1901. <em>Avodat Yisrael</em> is respected as a carefully edited work. Its sources are cited in the introduction, and Baer&#8217;s commentary frequently explains his choice of text among the variants in his source manuscripts. Its text forms the basis for many of the 20th century&#8217;s Ashkenazic <em>siddurim</em> (including the Singer Siddur, whose translation we have already transcribed). Its extensive commentary is frequently quoted in academic studies of the Jewish liturgy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A4%D7%AA%D7%97:Seligman_Baer_-_Seder_Avodat_Yisroel_(1901_ed.).pdf\">Transcribing</a> <em>Seder Avodat Yisroel</em> began in 2009 and continues today.
