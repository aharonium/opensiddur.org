            "bio": "Rabbi Maurice Liber (1884–1956), born in Warsaw, he was a scholar and the chief rabbi of France. Liber came to Paris with his parents at the age of four. After graduating from the Ecole Rabbinique de Paris in 1907 he began lecturing on Jewish history there. In 1911 he was appointed assistant to the chief rabbi of Paris, serving as an army chaplain and receiving the Croix de Guerre during World War Ⅰ. In 1920 Liber became rabbi at the Rue de la Victoire synagogue, in 1921 lecturer in the history of rabbinic Judaism at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, and in 1927 succeeded his teacher Israël Lévi as professor. He was appointed director of religious education by the Paris Consistoire in 1930 and, two years later, head of the Ecole Rabbinique. In 1934 Liber was appointed chief rabbi of France par interim, to assist the aging Israël Lévi in his task. Under the German occupation of France during World War Ⅱ, he strove hard to safeguard the Ecole Rabbinique – which had been evacuated to unoccupied southern France – and the religious character of the Consistoire. He also strove to maintain some sort of Jewish education, both legal and underground. Liber's chief field of research was French-Jewish history. He is best known by his biography of Rashi (1905; Eng. tr. 1906). He wrote a series of articles, based on archival sources, under the title \"Les Juifs et la convocation des Etats Généraux\" (in REJ, vols. 63–66, 1912–13), and another series, \"Napoléon et les Juifs\" (ibid., vols. 71–72, 1920–21). On liturgy he wrote, among other works, La Récitation du Schema… (1909), \"La Formation de la liturgie Synagogale\" (in Annuaire de l'Ecole des Hautes Etudes, 1933/34), and \"Structure and History of the Tefilah\" (in JQR, 40 (1949/50), 331–57). Liber also wrote an extensive introduction to the reprint of M. Schwab's French translation of the Palestinian Talmud (1932). Liber opposed Zionism, calling it a national theory unacceptable to those who believe that emancipation resolved the national question for the Jews. Though deeply religious, he felt compelled to compromise with the facts of French synagogue life, such as the use of an organ.",

Lambert initially studied in Metz before continuing to the rabbinical seminary in Paris where he received his rabbinical degree in 1886. He later studied at the Sorbonne. In 1887, he became professor of Arabic and Syriac at the seminary. In 1894, he also joined the seminary's faculty of Hebrew. During that time, he taught Hebrew at the École Normale Orientale, which was run by the Alliance Israélite Universelle. In 1903, he became professor of Arabic and Syriac at the École des Hautes Études. He was associated with Joseph Derenbourg for many years in Derenbourg's research into Hebrew and oriental literature. Lambert contributed a number of articles to periodicals like the Revue des Etudes Juives and the Journal Asiatique. He also contributed to the publication of the Corpus Inscriptionum Semiticarum and was involved with a French translation of the Bible that was issued by the French rabbinate. He published, among other articles, Eléments de Grammaire Hébraique in 1890, Commentaire sur le Séfer Yesira, ou livre de la Création par Saadiah in 1891, Saadiah's version of and commentary on Proverbs, text and French translation with Derenbourg Oeuvres complètes de Saadia. Traduction des Proverbes in 1894, and Glossaire hébreu-français du xiiime siècle with L. Brandin in 1905.

He also directed the establishment of regional Israelite Consistories, subordinate to the Central Consistory, across France and Italy. The consistories were ranked as <em>établissements publics du culte</em> (public-law corporations of worship). In its first year, the consistory was led by Rabbi David Sinzheim, who headed the Assembly of Notables and the Grand Sanhedrin that preceded it in organization.",
