Ximenes' antecedents are unknown, but from 1769 to 1770 he served as the last Ḥakham of the Sefaradi community of Hamburg, succeeding Jacob Bassan. Later he entered the service of the London Sefaradi community as a teacher and member of its bet din and gave expert evidence of Jewish marriage law in lawsuits in 1793 and 1798. He was active in Freemasonry.",

His texts were used by Jewish and Christian writers well into the 19th century.",

wherein the youth, as well as the hoary head, are instructed how to approach the God of Israel. </p>\n<p>It was originally my intention to dedicate this Publication to a Gentleman, whose talents and virtues have placed him in one of the first situations in the Community to which he has the honor to belong: but on more mature reflection, I conceived a Work of such general importance, would be better placed under your protection, as the Guardians and Conservators of your holy religion. </p>\n<p>In order to render it worthy your patronage, I have engaged Rabbi S.M. Ish Yeminy, for the Revision and Correction of the Work; the Hebrew of which will exactly correspond with the Edition published by S.R. Mendes, afterwards republished by Jacob Mendes de Silva, both of whom were <span class=\"hebrew\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">חזנים</span> of the Portuguese Synagogue at Amsterdam; and which was accepted and used in all the Portuguese Synagogues of Israelites, including that of <span class=\"hebrew\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">שער השמים</span> here in London.—Added to this, the beauty of the Type, as well as the Paper, I trust will combine to render it one of the most splendid, and correct performances, that ever issued from the press. </p>\n<p>With a reliance on your judgment, to appreciate its merits, I venture to commit it. </p>\n<p>And am,<br />\nGentlemen,<br />\nWith all possible esteem, _<br />\nYour obedient and devoted servant,<br />\nE. JUSTINS. </p>\n<p>Hebrew Printing Office,<br />\n34, Brick Lane, Spitalfields,<br />\nDec. 20, 1809.</p></blockquote>\n<hr />\n<blockquote><p>PREFACE. </p>\n<p>Through the repeated solicitations of many respectable Gentlemen of the Community, who have long lamented the great scarcity of the Work, the Proprietor, E. Justins, has undertaken to Reprint the late David Levi&#8217;s Edition, with such Alterations, Corrections, and Amendments, as were deemed absolutely necessary. </p>\n<p>For this purpose, he has furnished his Office with a complete assortment of Hebrew, as well as English Type, from the first Foundry in Europe; and he has also engaged a Rabbi of eminent abilities, for the express purpose of superintending the Publication. </p>\n<p>E.J. feels himself more qualified for the undertaking, from the circumstance of his having composed a great part of the former Edition, while with his Father, under the direction of the late Mr. David Levi. </p>\n<p>Of the utility of a Translation of the Prayers, nothing need be said; the liberal patronage experienced by the original Translator, is a sufficient inducement for the present Publisher to hope for similar encouragement in this improved Edition. </p></blockquote>\n<hr />\n<blockquote><p>ADVERTISEMENT. </p>\n<p>As it is intended to elucidate the translation by Notes, they will of course be numerous, and some of them of considerable length; therefore to avoid confusion, and taking off the reader’s attention during the time of prayer, and that the English page may exactly correspond with the Hebrew, they will be affixed at the end of the volume, where they will be regularly numbered, correspondent with those in the text, thus; (Ⅰ.) (Ⅱ.) (Ⅲ.) &#038;c. By this means, the notes will become more valuable, in illustrating such metaphors, &#038;c. as cannot properly be transfused; all which must greatly forward the attainment of a thorough knowledge of our Prayers, even to those who are not masters of the sacred language; so that they may be able to understand what they say, when addressing the Supreme Being. </p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"speaker-mute footnotes_reference_container\"> <div class=\"footnote_container_prepare\"><p><span role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"footnote_reference_container_label pointer\" onclick=\"footnote_expand_collapse_reference_container__1();\">Notes</span><span role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"footnote_reference_container_collapse_button\" style=\"display: none;; display: none;\" onclick=\"footnote_expand_collapse_reference_container__1();\"></span></p></div> <div id=\"footnote_references_container__1\" style=\"\"><table class=\"footnotes_table footnote-reference-container\"><caption class=\"accessibility\">Notes</caption> <tbody> \r\n\r\n<tr class=\"footnotes_plugin_reference_row\"> <th scope=\"row\" id=\"footnote_plugin_reference__1_1\" class=\"footnote_plugin_index pointer\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor__1('footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_1');\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"footnote_plugin_link\" >1</a></th> <td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">For the source of the Justins&#8217; given names, we were fortunate in happening over <a href=\"https://bookhistory.blogspot.com/2007/01/london-1775-1800-i-k.html\">this resource</a>.</td></tr>\r\n\r\n </tbody> </table> </div></div><script type=\"text/javascript\"> function footnote_expand_reference_container__1() { jQuery('#footnote_references_container__1').show(); jQuery('#footnote_reference_container_collapse_button__1').text('−'); } function footnote_collapse_reference_container__1() { jQuery('#footnote_references_container__1').hide(); jQuery('#footnote_reference_container_collapse_button__1').text('+'); } function footnote_expand_collapse_reference_container__1() { if (jQuery('#footnote_references_container__1').is(':hidden')) { footnote_expand_reference_container__1(); } else { footnote_collapse_reference_container__1(); } } function footnote_moveToReference__1(p_str_TargetID) { footnote_expand_reference_container__1(); var l_obj_Target = jQuery('#' + p_str_TargetID); if (l_obj_Target.length) { jQuery( 'html, body' ).delay( 0 ); jQuery('html, body').animate({ scrollTop: l_obj_Target.offset().top - window.innerHeight * 0.2 }, 380); } } function footnote_moveToAnchor__1(p_str_TargetID) { footnote_expand_reference_container__1(); var l_obj_Target = jQuery('#' + p_str_TargetID); if (l_obj_Target.length) { jQuery( 'html, body' ).delay( 0 ); jQuery('html, body').animate({ scrollTop: l_obj_Target.offset().top - window.innerHeight * 0.2 }, 380); } }</script>",
