            "bio": "Abraham Pereira Mendes (February 9, 1825 in Kingston, Jamaica ‚Äì April 18, 1893 in New York City) was an English rabbi and educator. He was the first master of the Beth Limud School of Kingston, but resigned in order to prepare in London, England for the vocation of preacher and rabbi. He studied under Dr. David Meldola, son of Haham Raphael Meldola, as well as under his future father-in-law, the Rev. D. A. de Sola, known as \"the learned Hazzan\" of the Sephardic community, and received his diplomas. He returned to Jamaica and became for a short time assistant to the Rev. Isaac Lopez, minister of the Kingston Sephardic congregation, but was soon called from that position to be the minister of the Montego Bay community. In 1883, he was called to the ministry at the historic Touro Synagogue in Newport, Rhode Island, by the guardian Congregation Shearith Israel of New York and continued as its minister until his death ten years later. He was the first among the Sephardim to publish a volume of sermons in English (1855). He translated the Daily Prayer-Book of the German Jews (Valentine's edition), and finished the translation of the Festival and Holy Day Books left incomplete by the death of Rev. D. A. de Sola. He published, besides, The Law of Moses, Post-Biblical History of the Jews (to fall of Jerusalem), Interlineary Translation of the Prayer-Book (German), and the Haggadah.",

It is hoped that its patrons will see realised in it all the expectations they have formed, and that the character of the work will sustain the reputation gained by its predecessors in the series. Like the Machsor its chief claim to public favour is based upon an elegance of diction, which has aimed at imparting to our liturgy some portion of the sublime beauty peculiarly characterizing the sacred language in which we daily address our Maker through the ever living words of Holy Writ. To the successful execution of this design there are naturally grave obstacles arising from the diversities in the characters of the two languages; but the task is rendered especially difficult by the necessity which is everywhere recognised of making the Tephillah a manual by means of which the sacred tongue is taught in our schools and families. How impossible it is to combine the almost literal fidelity of rendering requisite for this purpose with the flowing diction and correct phraseology in which prayer should be expressed, none but a Hebraist can realise.  It can scarcely be hoped that both ends have been at last attained; but if the reproach so commonly heard &#8220;that our prayers do not read like prayers,&#8221; is in any degree removed by this translation, a great success will have been achieved and a pious purpose subserved. </p>\n<p>But there are other important features characterising this edition which must not be overlooked. The insertion of many of our ceremonies hitherto excluded from a Hebrew-English Tephillah, and the <span class=\"hebrew\">◊ì◊ô◊†◊ô◊ù</span>, or laws relating to our sacred rites and seasons, are of themselves sufficient to gain the appreciation of our co-religionists. The English Jew is now found in almost every clime. In the distant plains of Australia, in the backwoods of America, in the yet unreclaimed wilds of Colombia he is met preserving his religious identity in the midst of other creeds, and under the most adverse circumstances rearing his family to the service of his God. Such a one must have frequently longed for some guide book, to aid him in his labour of love, by directing him how to perpetuate in the midst of strangers the knowledge of those ceremonials which envelope the faith of Israel, and which are God&#8217;s own means of preserving religion and virtue in the hearts and homes of his people. To such isolated children of the covenant this book will prove a real treasure. It will carry to them the means of comfort in its ancient words of prayer, and with the religion of the spirit it will combine instruction in the religion of the act, and preach Jewish practice in the land of strangers. </p>\n<p>May it accomplish its holy purpose, and prove fruitful in blessing to our people, by attaching them more closely to the religion of their fathers, ‚Äî thus promoting throughout the world the glory of the God of Israel. Amen. </p>\n<p>A.P. MENDES.\n</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n",
