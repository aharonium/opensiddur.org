I availed myself of as many sources as are known to me, and selected the material which I found to be merit and suited for popular use. I have no doubt that many a student of Jewish Music will be missing some of his favorite songs, but I was guided by my own experience, by the limitations of space and the cost of production. The classifications of the songs need not be strictly adhered to, they are merely suggestions. In the transliteration from the Hebrew, I employed the system which I have found most usable. It is to be regretted that there is as yet no universal system of transliteration. </p>\n<p>I am greatly indebted to the many composers and compilers listed at the end of this book, whose works made this Songster possible. I am also under obligation to the thousands of children and adults who, for many years, permitted me to experiment and test these songs on them; to my friends of the Board of Jewish Education, Chicago-particularly Mr. Hyman Reznick; and to my wife who laboured indefatiguably in the preparation of this collection. Finally-this book is in large measure due to the constant encouragement, guidance, deep love for Jewish music, and material assistance of Rabbi Solomon Goldman. </p>\n<p>H. C. </p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
