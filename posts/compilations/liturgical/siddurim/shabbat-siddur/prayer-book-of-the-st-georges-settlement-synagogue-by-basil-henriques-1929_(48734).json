In the main, they take the traditional form. But as they are intended for use in a Progressive Synagogue, the aim throughout has been to prove that through such a form modern thought can be expressed. It is hoped that there is no prayer which conflicts with the thoughts and aspirations of that type of Judaism for which the Synagogue stands.</p>\n<p>Many of the translations are taken directly from the Authorised Orthodox, the West London and the Liberal Jewish prayer books. Some, however, are not translations at all, but paraphrases, and the English has been so altered as almost to change the original sense. Such prayers will probably be read in English, and the Hebrew has been retained in order to show the ancient thought upon which the modern interpretation is based.</p>\n<p>The supplementary prayers are taken from “The Fratres Prayer Book” (compiled by me for the members of the Oxford and St. George’s Jewish Lads’ Club in 1916) and from “Prayers for Trench and Base” (which I published for the use of Jewish troops during the war in 1918), many of which had themselves been adapted from the Liberal Jewish Prayer Book.</p>\n<p>I have to thank Mr. C.G. Montefiore, my friend and master, for the personal help he has given me in connection with this book. He is in no way responsible, however, for the form of the Services, which I believe to be of such a kind as to meet the requirements of my congregation in East London.</p>\n<p>I would also like to thank my colleague, Mr. A. Pulverness, without whose aid the synagogue would never have been founded, for the assistance he has given me in the preparation of this prayer book.</p>\n<p>I pray that Almighty God may grant that this book may help to consolidate and strengthen those who have now worshipped together in East London since 1919, and that through it the doctrines of Progressive Judaism may be more widely spread and understood.</p>\n<p>BASIL L.Q. HENRIQUES.<br />\nMay, 1929.\n</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
