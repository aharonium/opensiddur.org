The Hebrew prayers have been transliterated so that even those who have no knowledge whatever of our sacred tongue will be able to follow the chants and responses. To enable the worshipper to tell at a glance when he is to read, all responses and unison readings are clearly marked. Five variations for five Sabbaths are suggested. They have been used in the synagogue and were found helpful in giving fuller and more meaningful expression to the service.\n</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\n<span class=\"hebrew\">שַׁלְמֵי תּוֹדָה</span> THANK-OFFERING</p>\n<p>It is with pleasure that I record my appreciation to my distinguished teacher, Dr. Shalom Spiegel, Professor of Hebrew Literature, Jewish Institute of Religion, New York, who graciously read the manuscript, and whose criticism and comments have enhanced the usefulness of this book. </p>\n<p>My thanks must also go to my friend, Rabbi Bernard Harrison, director, Councils of Jewish Students, Los Angeles, California, for his suggestions and proofreading. </p>\n<p>My gratitude indicates no shift of responsibility, however; that rests entirely with me. </p>\n<p>The worshippers of Temple Sinai, to whom I minister these seven years, must also receive a debt of gratitude; for three years they gave me the opportunity to experiment with this service in mimeographed form. </p>\n<p>Finally, to those who contributed generously and financially fathered this book, my heartfelt thanks.

The art of prayer, the Jews’ greatest form of religious expression, is no longer common to all Jews; it is all too quickly being forgotten. Too many Jews no longer know how to pray. When the average Jew enters the house of worship, he seldom contributes to the warmth and glow of religious enthusiasm that once pervaded God’s abode. Quite often he is ill at ease; he recites his ritual perfunctorily, and is numbed by the lack of religious ardor of the people about him. Many a worshipper can hardly wait for the end of the service to come, and complains when worship is somewhat longer than usual. Indeed, the temple of the spirit seems dead. </p>\n<p>DETOUR FROM GOD</p>\n<p>Some have contended that religious fervor is in the ascendancy during trying periods, when world confusion is thickest, when Jewish suffering is intense. We are engaged in a grim struggle for our very survival. The mind of man is confused and darkness seems to prevail. But have we moved nearer to God? Have not some cried out in despair againse Him because of the spread of injustice and tyranny, conditions which man’s complacency alone has permitted to grow? Man himself has created the misery and confusion; man has willfully detoured from the road of life.<span class=\"footnote_referrer\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_3');\" onkeypress=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_3');\" ><sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_3\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\">[3]</sup></a><span id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_3\" class=\"footnote_tooltip\"> Deuteronomy 30:19 <span class=\"hebrew\">הַחַיִּים וְהַמָּוֶת נָתַתִּי לְפָנֶיךָ הַבְּרָכָה וְהַקְּלָלָה וּבָחַרְתָּ בַּחַיִּים</span> “I have put life and death before you, the blessing and the curse; therefore choose life.”&nbsp;</span></span><script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery('#footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_3').tooltip({ tip: '#footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_3', tipClass: 'footnote_tooltip', effect: 'fade', predelay: 0, fadeInSpeed: 200, delay: 400, fadeOutSpeed: 200, position: 'center right', relative: true, offset: [0, 0], });</script> But many of our “modern” Jews apparently do not understand this. Unschooled in his religious tradition and weaned away from spiritual life, many a Jew too often eschews or abandons the synagogue, impoverishing himself and weakening Judaism. The result is that religious activities are held in derision and our synagogues are becoming more and more empty and desolate, thus endangering the very future of Judaism. </p>\n<p>DECAY OF STUDY</p>\n<p>We have failed, and we know wherein we fell short. In America, the blessed land of the free, bursting with wealth, opportunity, and hope, Judaism found the occasion to develop in freedom. But too many of us spurned this precious privilege. In the mad scramble for wealth, position, and security, the Jew’s one salvation, his one sustenance through countless eras—his Torah, his education, has been ignored.

With the elevation of fleshly gods and the degradation of Jewish study has come the gradual dissolution of traditional Judaism.

Like God, prayer cannot be talked about. It is a thing of the inner life, of the spirit, and is too sacred and intimate to dissect. We can fix it as an instinct; we can say it is as native a desire to converse with God as it is natural for a child to speak with his parents. But we cannot anatomize it. We know what prayer is when we sense it, when we feel what it means to us, when we are conscious what it does for us.

Praying within the community means learning to pray for the good of the community, indeed for the good of all. Public worship in the synagogue links us with the humblest Jew everywhere.

The verv phraseology of our prayers stresses the importance of public worship.<span class=\"footnote_referrer\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_35');\" onkeypress=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_35');\" ><sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_35\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\">[35]</sup></a><span id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_35\" class=\"footnote_tooltip\"> The phraseology in the Siddur is consistently in the plural.&nbsp;</span></span><script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery('#footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_35').tooltip({ tip: '#footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_35', tipClass: 'footnote_tooltip', effect: 'fade', predelay: 0, fadeInSpeed: 200, delay: 400, fadeOutSpeed: 200, position: 'center right', relative: true, offset: [0, 0], });</script> Seldom do we pray for ourselves individually; most frequently for Kelal Israel, for the entire Jewish people. </p>\n<p>THE CONSERVATIVE APPROACH</p>\n<p>We must, therefore, do all we can to impress upon our people the full import of public worship. That is why Conservative Rabbis continue to publish independent prayer books. They are convinced that public worship must once again assume its former prominent role. This can be done only by presenting the essence of Jewish worship in intelligible terms. The fact that many attempts are made to present the conservative approach to prayer is no indication that the conservative group is divided. It shows rather a love for tradition and the awareness of the urgent need for saving that tradition by presenting to our uninformed generation an intelligent approach to worship. An understandable interpretation of the traditional service can, if you will, bridge the gap between parents and children. </p>\n<p>FAMILIES DIVIDED</p>\n<p>For the spectacle of the division of families in worship is a sorry one. It points to a great ill in American Jewish life. It is not uncommon to see grandparents attending services in the orthodox Shul, parents in the conservative synagogue, and children in the reform temple.

We must try to inject the spirit of worship and preserve the traditional skeleton of the service. We must retain the more important elements of the service, if it be impossible to go through its entirety. Oneg Shabbat should not be set at a time conflicting with public service. Nor can parlor meetings, or “at home” on Sabbath eve or afternoon replace the worship of the synagogue.<span class=\"footnote_referrer\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_37');\" onkeypress=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_37');\" ><sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_37\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\">[37]</sup></a><span id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_37\" class=\"footnote_tooltip\"> Unfortunately it is the vogue for Jewish organizations to arrange parlor meetings on Sabbath afternoons, sometimes also on Sabbath eve, for discussion and refreshments.

The topics at these “shmues” sessions are seldom Jewish; too much religion has got to be avoided. Such is Oneg Shabbat. That such “Oneg Shabbats” present a definite threat to synagogue worship is self-evident.&nbsp;</span></span><script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery('#footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_37').tooltip({ tip: '#footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_37', tipClass: 'footnote_tooltip', effect: 'fade', predelay: 0, fadeInSpeed: 200, delay: 400, fadeOutSpeed: 200, position: 'center right', relative: true, offset: [0, 0], });</script></p>\n<p>A PLEA FOR BREVITY</p>\n<p>Though the important elements in the service must be preserved so that Jewish historical continuity will not be destroyed, the late service must aim for brevity. And in the interest of true worship, brevity is by no means counter to Jewish tradition. Rabbinic literature is replete with suggestions that indicate the practice of brevity wherever it is demanded by circumstances. Perhaps the most classical example is the one that speaks of the disciples of Rabbi Eliezer who complained that one of their colleagues would at times prolong his prayers, while at other times he would shorten them.

The importance of Hebrew, the language for Jewish prayer, cannot be overstressed. Hebrew is the language of holiness, saturated with sacred memories since the day man first heard the voice of God from Mount Horeb. Even those who do not understand Hebrew are stirred by its rhythm and majestic cadences. Those who know even a little Hebrew will readily conceive how futile, how unreliable even the best translation must be. Often the best translation distorts the fundamental concepts of our faith. No other language can equal Hebrew as a vehicle for prayer. Moreover, Hebrew is common to all Jews, and has been throughout the ages the mortar that cemented Israel. If we are in earnest about keeping the historical continuity of our people, if we want to develop the sense of Jewish oneness, Hebrew is the only instrument for that task. </p>\n<p>HEBREW—NOT MUMBO JUMBO</p>\n<p>But Hebrew must sound like Hebrew; words must be pronounced clearly, and not degraded to mumbo jumbo. The Hebrew prayers and responses should not be rushed, and maimed. For the sake of those who do not read Hebrew, every word in the prayer book should be transliterated. The ancient chants and sacred responses would then be easily followed. More than that, through frequent repetition these transliterated prayers will be learned by heart, and thus in turn enable some to read and understand Hebrew. Others may not remain satisfied with such a minimum requirement of intelligent worship, and will turn to more serious and rewarding study of our language and tradition. Thus they will gain an authentic understanding and feeling for the sacred literature and heritage of Israel. The transliterator’s labors will be amply repaid if he were to earn even a few for such study or love of the Holy tongue. </p>\n<p>SUPPLEMENTARY PRAYERS</p>\n<p>Supplementary prayers are important and find a place in every service; but they cannot be clothed with the dignity of our ancient Siddur, which even a Christian reader found incomparably superior to “the half-dozen or so great liturgies of the world” which he examined.<span class=\"footnote_referrer\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_67');\" onkeypress=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_67');\" ><sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_67\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\">[67]</sup></a><span id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_67\" class=\"footnote_tooltip\"> G.E. Biddle, quoted in <em>A Book of Jewish Thoughts</em>, Hertz, p. 160.&nbsp;</span></span><script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery('#footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_67').tooltip({ tip: '#footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_67', tipClass: 'footnote_tooltip', effect: 'fade', predelay: 0, fadeInSpeed: 200, delay: 400, fadeOutSpeed: 200, position: 'center right', relative: true, offset: [0, 0], });</script> Supplementary prayers, designed for special occasions only, lack the immortal qualities of the standard prayers and should not be included in the prayer book. Many Rabbis often have special prayers in the vernacular, and a good practice it is; but these should be set apart and marked clearly as additions. Printed alongside the sacred Hebrew prayers, these transitory accretions may assume in the eye of the uninstructed some of the sanctity and universal validity of traditional prayers. There is not only the danger that they might overshadow the Hebrew language of the prayers, but also that they might supplant the basic and imperishable teachings of the old prayers with fleeting fashions of the day. </p>\n<p>* * * * </p>\n<p>The ancient prayers of the Siddur deserve ever again to be heard in the Tents of Jacob. The process of recreating the Jewish spirit along traditional lines will be slow and arduous. But we dare not give up hope. We must continue to labor in an effort to re-attune the soul of American Israel to prayer.\n</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"speaker-mute footnotes_reference_container\"> <div class=\"footnote_container_prepare\"><p><span role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"footnote_reference_container_label pointer\" onclick=\"footnote_expand_collapse_reference_container__1();\">Notes</span><span role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"footnote_reference_container_collapse_button\" style=\"display: none;; display: none;\" onclick=\"footnote_expand_collapse_reference_container__1();\"></span></p></div> <div id=\"footnote_references_container__1\" style=\"\"><table class=\"footnotes_table footnote-reference-container\"><caption class=\"accessibility\">Notes</caption> <tbody> \r\n\r\n<tr class=\"footnotes_plugin_reference_row\"> <th scope=\"row\" id=\"footnote_plugin_reference__1_1\" class=\"footnote_plugin_index pointer\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor__1('footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_1');\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"footnote_plugin_link\" >1</a></th> <td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">Hosea 8:14 <span class=\"hebrew\">וַיִּשְׁכַּח יִשְׂרָאֵל אֶת־עֹשֵׂהוּ וַיִּבֶן הֵיכָלוֹת</span> “For Israel forgot his Maker and built palaces.”</td></tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"footnotes_plugin_reference_row\"> <th scope=\"row\" id=\"footnote_plugin_reference__1_2\" class=\"footnote_plugin_index pointer\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor__1('footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_2');\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"footnote_plugin_link\" >2</a></th> <td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">One cannot help but recall Jeremiah’s sarcastic outcry against those Jews who placed so much trust in the outward beauty of the Temple.
