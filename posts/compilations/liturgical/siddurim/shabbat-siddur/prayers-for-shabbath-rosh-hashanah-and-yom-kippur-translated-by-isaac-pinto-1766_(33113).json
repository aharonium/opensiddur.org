Pinto prepared the first Jewish prayer-book published in America, which was also the first English translation of the Siddur (1766). A member of Congregation Shearith Israel, he served as one of the first official translators hired by the United States government in 1781 under authorization of the Continental Congress working in the Department of Foreign Affairs, the predecessor to the modern Department of State.",

In Europe, the Spanish and Portuguese Jews have a Translation in Spanish, which as they generally understand, may be sufficient; but that not being the Case in the British Dominions in America, has induced me to Attempt a Translation in English, not without Hope that it will tend to the Improvement of many of my Brethren in their Devotion; and if it answer that Good Intention, it will afford me the Satisfaction of having contributed towards it. In Justice to the Learned and Reverend H.H.R. Ishac Nieto, I must have received from his Elegant Spanish Translation of the Prayers of Rosh-hashanah and Kippur: From which, by particular Desire, I have taken the Liberty of translating his Exhortation, and prefixing it to these Sheets. Not withstanding my utmost Care, I make no doubt this Translation has its Errors, and the Stile I am sensible has its Defects, which I hope will meet with Indulgence from the candid Reader. </p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
