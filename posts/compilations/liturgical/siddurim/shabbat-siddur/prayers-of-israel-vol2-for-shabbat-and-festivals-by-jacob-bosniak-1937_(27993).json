            "bio": "Yitsḥaḳ Yaakov (Jacob) Bosniak (also Bosnyak, 1887–1963) was an American Conservative rabbi. Bosniak was born in Russia, immigrated to the U.S. in 1903, and completed his rabbinical studies at the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Yeshivah, an Orthodox seminary, in 1907. In 1917, he was ordained at the Jewish Theological Seminary, where he earned a Doctor of Hebrew Letters in 1933. In 1921, after having served Congregation Shearith Israel in Dallas, Texas, he became rabbi of the Ocean Parkway Jewish Center in Brooklyn, n.y., a congregation he was to serve for 28 years. He was president of the Brooklyn Board of Rabbis (1938–40), chairman of the *Rabbinical Assembly's Rabbinic Ethics Committee (1945–48) and a judge (dayyan) and member of the Board of Directors of the Jewish Conciliation Board of America. Believing in the need for a uniform prayer book (siddur) with modern English translations, Bosniak published several prayer books that gained wide acceptance in Conservative synagogues. He edited <em>Prayers of Israel</em> (1925, 1937), <em>Likutei Tefilot: Public and Pulpit Prayers</em> (1927) and <em>Anthology of Prayer</em> (1958), prayer books that included English translations of Sabbath and Holiday prayers, English hymns, responsive readings, and instructions related to worship in English. In 1944, he published <em>Interpreting Jewish Life: The Sermons and Addresses of Jacob Bosniak</em>. Upon his retirement in 1949, Bosniak was elected rabbi emeritus and devoted his time to Jewish scholarship, publishing a critical edition of <em>The Commentary of David Kimhi on the Fifth Book of Psalms</em> (1954).",

No prayer has been omitted or changed. Of the Piyutim, only those that are recited by all Orthodox and Conservative congregations are given at the end of the book. </p>\n<p>There has been a pressing need for a prayer- book which should combine the Sabbath and Festival prayers in one handy volume. Almost all congregations provide prayer-books for their worshippers ; and the expense of buying two books has proven too big a burden to many of them. </p>\n<p>The English translation has been adopted from the best versions used in England and in America. Our thanks are due to the Jewish Publication Society of America for its kind permission to reprint in this volume its English version of all Biblical passages that form part of the regular prayers. </p>\n<p>It has long been felt that the rendition of the word “Torah” by “Law” has been erroneous, since the word Torah is in most cases used for the entire body of sacred Hebrew literature. (See <em>Jewish Encyclopedia</em>, Vol. XII, p. 196c.) Hence the word “Torah” is used in the English translation; and the interested reader who is not acquainted with the Hebrew will find its definition in any standard dictionary. </p>\n<p>JACOB BOSNIAK,<br />\nBrooklyn, N. Y.,<br />\nSivan, 5685-1925</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION </p>\n<p>The generous reception accorded to “Prayers of Israel” for the Sabbath and Festivals, encouraged me to issue a second revised edition. </p>\n<p>I am highly indebted for the suggestions and encour¬ agement given to me by Rabbis and laymen all over the country, too numerous to mention. </p>\n<p>In accordance with these suggestions I included the Afternoon Prayers for the Sabbath and Festivals as well as the Minha for EREV SHABBOS and EREV YOM-TOV. This edition also contains an excellent translation of “Akdomuth ’’ by Rabbi Joseph Marcus. </p>\n<p>It is my hope that this new edition will meet with the same approval and favor as the first, and will find a permanent place in the Synagogue of American Israel. </p>\n<p>JACOB BOSNIAK,<br />\nBrooklyn. N.Y.,<br />\nTamuz, 5686-1926 </p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
