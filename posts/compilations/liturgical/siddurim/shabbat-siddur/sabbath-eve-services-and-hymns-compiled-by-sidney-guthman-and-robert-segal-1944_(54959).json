To this end, the prayerbook also contains extensive musical notation for liturgical melodies and hymns. </p>\n<p>If the presentation of alternate Friday night services with a tradition of call and response prayer and hymn singing sounds like a classical Reform movement service, then that is what makes this siddur unusual, as Guthman was a Conservative movement rabbi. This prayerbook was probably intended as a means by which Conservative rabbis might re-introduce traditional liturgical arrangements into services structured in ways familiar to Reform synagogue attendees. </p>\n<style>\n       .errordiv { padding:10px; margin:10px; border: 1px solid #555555;color: #000000;background-color: #f8f8f8; width:500px; }#advanced_iframe {visibility:visible;opacity:1;vertical-align:top;}.ai-info-bottom-iframe { position: fixed; z-index: 10000; bottom:0; left: 0; margin: 0px; text-align: center; width: 100%; background-color: #ff9999; padding-left: 5px;padding-bottom: 5px; border-top: 1px solid #aaa } a.ai-bold {font-weight: bold;}#ai-layer-div-advanced_iframe p {height:100%;margin:0;padding:0}#ai-div-container-advanced_iframe\n       {\n           position: relative;\n           width: 100%; max-width: 100%;}\n       #ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe\n       {\n          position: absolute;\n          z-index:1000;\n          margin-left:-33px;\n          left: 50%;   top: 150px;\n         }}\n       #ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe img\n       {\n          border: none;\n       }</style><script type=\"text/javascript\">var ai_iframe_width_advanced_iframe = 0;var ai_iframe_height_advanced_iframe = 0;var aiIsIe8=false;var aiOnloadScrollTop=\"true\";var aiShowDebug=false;\n\t\tif (typeof aiReadyCallbacks === 'undefined') {\n\t\t\tvar aiReadyCallbacks = [];\n\t\t} else if (!(aiReadyCallbacks instanceof Array)) {\n\t\t\tvar aiReadyCallbacks = [];\n\t\t}    function aiShowIframeId(id_iframe) { jQuery(\"#\"+id_iframe).css(\"visibility\", \"visible\");    }    function aiResizeIframeHeight(height) { aiResizeIframeHeight(height,advanced_iframe); }    function aiResizeIframeHeightId(height,width,id) {aiResizeIframeHeightById(id,height);}</script><div id=\"ai-div-container-advanced_iframe\"><div id=\"ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-loader-icon\" src=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/plugins/advanced-iframe/img/loader.gif\" title=\"Loading\" alt=\"Loading\" /></div><iframe id=\"advanced_iframe\"  name=\"advanced_iframe\"  src=\"https://archive.org/stream/sabbath-eve-services-and-hymns-robert-segal-and-sidney-guthman-1944/Sabbath%20Eve%20Services%20and%20Hymns%20%28Robert%20H.%20Segal%20and%20Sidney%20S.%20Guthman%201944%29#page/n3/mode/2up\"  width=\"100%\"  height=\"900\"  frameborder=\"0\"  border=\"0\"  allowtransparency=\"true\"  loading=\"lazy\"  style=\";width:100%;height:900px;;width:1px;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;\"  allowfullscreen  onload='jQuery(&quot;#ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe&quot;).hide();;jQuery(&quot;#ai-div-loader-global&quot;).hide()' ></iframe></div><script type=\"text/javascript\">var ifrm_advanced_iframe = document.getElementById(\"advanced_iframe\");var hiddenTabsDoneadvanced_iframe = false;\nfunction resizeCallbackadvanced_iframe() {}var recalculateIframeResizeadvanced_iframe = 0;\n        var recalculateIframeOrientationchangeadvanced_iframe = 0;\n        var aiWindowWidth = 0;\n\t\tfunction recalculateIframeadvanced_iframe() {\n          clearTimeout(recalculateIframeResizeadvanced_iframe);\n          clearTimeout(recalculateIframeOrientationchangeadvanced_iframe);}\n        function initResponsiveIframeadvanced_iframe() {\n          jQuery(window).resize(function() {\n\t\t\t recalculateIframeResizeadvanced_iframe = window.setTimeout(\"recalculateIframeadvanced_iframe()\",100);\n          });\n          if (window.addEventListener) {\n            window.addEventListener(\"orientationchange\", function() {\n               recalculateIframeOrientationchangeadvanced_iframe = window.setTimeout(\"recalculateIframeadvanced_iframe()\",100);\n            }, false);\n          }\n        }\n        aiReadyCallbacks.push(initResponsiveIframeadvanced_iframe);</script><style>#advanced_iframe {width: 1px !important;min-width:100% !important;max-width:100% !important;}</style><script type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n<p>This work is in the Public Domain due to the lack of a copyright renewal by the copyright holder listed in the copyright notice (a condition required for works published in the United States between January 1st 1924 and January 1st 1964).</p>\n<p>This digital edition was prepared by Aharon Varady for the Open Siddur Project from a copy held in the collection of the HUC-JIR Klau Library in Cincinnati, Ohio.

As a supplement to the traditional “Kabbolas Shabbos,” they are steadily gaining in popularity. </p>\n<p>Much has been done to beautify these services. However, while great stress has been placed upon aesthetic improvement, little, as yet, has been done to encourage the worshipper to participate in the service. </p>\n<p>We have long pondered this problem, and it is our conviction that greater interest can be stimulated if the services are arranged so as to permit fuller participation of the congregation. </p>\n<p>We have therefore undertaken the task of arranging services which call for congregational singing and reading. With this end in view, we have included more prayers and psalms for responsive reading and selected traditional chants and hymns. These simple rhythms and sweet melodies will not only captivate the congregation but also stimulate their spiritual emotions. </p>\n<p>We have included several services arranged in a manner conducive to congregational participation. We hope in this way to stimulate greater religious fervor and inspiration among the worshippers. </p>\n<p>The translations, it must be noted, are based on the spirit rather than the literal meaning of the Hebrew context. </p>\n<p>In the near future, we hope to publish our Sabbath morning and festival services following a similar arrangement.<span class=\"footnote_referrer\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_1');\" onkeypress=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_1');\" ><sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_1\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\">[1]</sup></a><span id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_1\" class=\"footnote_tooltip\"> I am not aware of this anticipated prayerbook ever having been published, alas. &#8211;Aharon Varady&nbsp;</span></span><script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery('#footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_1').tooltip({ tip: '#footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_1', tipClass: 'footnote_tooltip', effect: 'fade', predelay: 0, fadeInSpeed: 200, delay: 400, fadeOutSpeed: 200, position: 'center right', relative: true, offset: [0, 0], });</script> </p>\n<p>In presenting this effort of ours to the American Jewish congregations, it is our earnest prayer that it will meet with favor in the “sight of God and man.” </p>\n<p>Boston, May 1944.<br />\nThe Editors\n</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\nSUGGESTED METHOD OF PROCEDURE </p>\n<p>The editors have found the following method to be the most practicable in bringing about congregational participation in these services. </p>\n<p>Invite a group of congregants to meet during the week. Play the melodies included herein until the group is sufficiently familiar with them. During the service, seat these people amongst the congregation in various sections throughout the auditorium. When the reader reaches a point of response, these people who have been instructed in the singing of the melodies should act as leaders and sing out in full voice. </p>\n<p>In a short time, the entire congregation will thus be able to participate in the singing of these services.\n</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS </p>\n<p>We make grateful acknowledgement to the following for their kind permission to use material included in this Prayer Book. </p>\n<p>To Dr. Abraham W. Binder, for the hymn “Come O Sabbath Day”, and for his advice in the selection of other hymns. </p>\n<p>To the Bloch Publishing Company, for several hymns reprinted here. </p>\n<p>To Rabbi Israel Goldfarb, for the musical settings of “L’cho Dodi”, “Kiddush” and “Sholom Aleichem”, from “Friday Evening Melodies”. </p>\n<p>To Dr. Solomon Solis—Cohen, for the translation of “L’cho Dodi”. </p>\n<p>To Mrs. Menachem M. Eichler, for two prayers before the “ Kaddish” written by the late Rabbi Menachem M.
