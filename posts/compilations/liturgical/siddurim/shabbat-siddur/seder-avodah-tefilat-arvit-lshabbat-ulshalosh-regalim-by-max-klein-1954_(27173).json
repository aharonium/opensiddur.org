Soon afterward, he began serving as rabbi for Congregation Adath Jeshurun in Philadelphia. Formerly a Reform synagogue, under Rabbi Klein's leadership it became one of the initial congregations affiliated with the United Synagogue of America (now called the United Synagogue for Conservative Judaism). In addition to serving as rabbi at Adath Jeshurun in Philadelphia until 1960, Rabbi Klein wrote, edited, and translated two prayer books: <em>Seder Avodah for Sabbath, Festivals, and Weekdays</em> (1951) and <em>Seder Avodah for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur</em> (1960). He died in 1973.",

This edition of the <span style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\">Seder Avodah</span> is intended to enable them to follow the Hebrew Service in this transliterated form. </p>\n<p>II </p>\n<p>Desiring, however, to avoid the practice, common to many books, and which gives a false impression of the liturgy, of transliterating a passage here and there like the <em>Sh&#8217;ma</em>, <em>Mi Chomocho</em>, <em>Kaddish</em> and <em>Adon Olom</em>, this edition of the <span style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\">Seder Avodah</span> has transliterated the Hebrew Service in its entirety. This will enable the individual to follow the Hebrew service when recited by the cantor or to engage in silent devotion in the original in its transliterated form. It is hoped that many will be influenced to learn to read the Hebrew original as a result of this transliteration. </p>\n<p>III</p>\n<p>The transliteration herewith presented differs in method from all previous attempts in that several of the Hebrew vowels are utilized; and altogether, the aim has been to give a transliteration which remains as faithful, as is feasibly possible, to the original Hebrew both in regard to the appearance of the word and in regard to its correct pronunciation and accentuation. </p>\n<p>IV </p>\n<p>In order to promote facility and fluency in following the service it is suggested that individuals and groups practice the reading and singing of portions of the transliterated text. </p>\n<p>V </p>\n<p>To this end lessons on how to read the transliterated text have been provided on pages XII, XIII, XIV and XV, at the beginning of this volume. </p>\n<p>VI </p>\n<p>It should be noted that this edition contains the complete text in Hebrew characters and the English transliteration thereof; also, the English translation of the entire Hebrew text as well as all the original English prayers now in the <em>Evening Service — Sabbath and Festivals</em> in the first edition of the <span style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\">Seder Avodah</span>. It should also be noted that this edition is based on the material in the second edition of the <span style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\">Seder Avodah</span> (revised and enlarged) which, it is hoped, will appear in the near future. </p>\n<p>VII </p>\n<p>It is planned, depending upon the favorable reaction of the Congregations for whose use this transliterated edition has been issued, to publish in the manner of this volume, the <em>Morning</em> and <em>Afternoon Services</em> for <em>Sabbath</em> and <em>Festivals</em> now contained in the <span style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\">Seder Avodah</span>. </p>\n<p>VIII </p>\n<p>The Editor herewith expresses his thanks to Rabbi Edward T. Sandrow of Temple Beth El, Cedarhurst, Long Island, who showed great interest in the Editor’s approach to the transliteration and encouraged him to publish this volume; also to the Editor’s colleague and associate in Congregation Adath Jeshurun in Philadelphia, Rabbi Morris V. Dembowitz, for his general interest in this work and for his particular aid in the arduous task of proof reading. </p>\n<p>IX </p>\n<p>The Editor expresses thanks also to Dr. Maurice Jacobs of the Press of Maurice Jacobs, Inc., for his constant helpfulness; and to Mr. David Skaraton and the fine corps of men under his direction for their many kindnesses in the course of the printing of this book; and a special word of gratitude to the Press of <span style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\">Maurice Jacobs, Inc.</span> for having cut new type to meet the needs of the transliteration in accordance with the Editor’s desires. To his friend, Dr. Menahem G. Glenn, the Editor is again indebted for many a wise suggestion from which this volume has greatly benefited. </p>\n<p>X </p>\n<p>It is the Editor’s hope that this work may fulfil the purposes which it was intended to serve. </p>\n<p>Max D. Klein<br />\nRabbi, Congregation Adath Jeshurun,<br />\nPhiladelphia, Pa. </p>\n<p>October, 1954<br />\nTishri, 5715\n</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
