    "excerpt": "The experimental siddur, <em>Prayers & Readings Selected and Arranged by Rabbi Solomon Goldman</em> can be found appended to Harry Coopersmith's songbook, <em>Songs of My People</em> (1938). The work, I believe, is an excellent reflection of the creative spirit of the nascent Reconstructionist movement. Goldman's prayerbook is both traditional and expansive, seeking to bring into its pages both familiar liturgy along with additional works from all over Jewish literary history. The work represents what Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan would call a \"Binder Siddur\" -- the siddur as a container of inspired works for collective reading and reflection in the synagogue. Perhaps even for personal use. With its good number of authors and translators expressing different voices appealing to Goldman, <em>Prayers & Readings</em> is also a kind of proto-Open Siddur. However, unlike the Open Siddur, Goldman only provides acknowledgement of the various authors and translators in his preface, and we are left uncertain as to which works should actually be attributed to each contributor. If you can tell which of the listed authors and translators contributed what, please leave a comment or <a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/contact/\">contact us</a>.  . . .",

I hesitated for a long time to comply with his request. A Reader for the Synagogue should be prepared by our most inspired Hebrew writers. Some day Eretz Yisrael will give us the old Siddur revised and enlarged. But Mr. Coopersmith was insistent and I yielded. </p>\n<p>I selected my material from the following sources: </p>\n<p>The traditional liturgy<br />\nMiriam Del Banco<br />\n[Hayim Nahman] Bialik<br />\n[Louis] Brandeis<br />\n[Lord George Gordon] Byron<br />\nJacob Cohen<br />\nDeuteronomy<br />\nEcclesiastes<br />\n[Albert] Einstein<br />\nExodus<br />\nEzekiel<br />\nYehuda Halevi<br />\nAvigdor Ham’iri<br />\n[Heinrich] Heine<br />\nIsabella R. Hess<br />\nHosea<br />\nThomas Huxley<br />\nIbn Gabirol<br />\nIsaiah<br />\nJeremiah<br />\nKings<br />\n[Yitzhak] Lamdan<br />\nLeviticus<br />\nMicah<br />\nMishnah Abot<br />\nNumbers<br />\nProverbs<br />\nPsalms<br />\nRachel [Bluwstein]&nbsp;<br />\n[Saul] Raskin<br />\nRebecca Hyneman<br />\n[Ernest] Renan<br />\nThe Book of Samuel<br />\n[Solomon] Schechter<br />\n[Percy Bysshe] Shelley<br />\n[David] Shiminowitz<br />\nThe Song of Songs<br />\nThe Standard Book of Jewish Verse<br />\nJacob Steinberg<br />\nThe Talmud<br />\nThe Testament of Gad<br />\nThe Testament of Zebulun<br />\nThe Wisdom of Solomon<br />\n[Israel] Zangwill </p>\n<p>I availed myself of translations by Mr. Maurice Samuel, Mr. L.V. Snowman, and Mr. Harry H. Fein. Several of the translations from the modern Hebrew were done by Mr. Ben Aronin and myself. I have also translated one of the selections from [Heinrich] Heine, and one from [Ernest] Renan. Of the selection from Professor Einstein, I preferred the translation in Doctor Lewisohn’s “Rebirth,” to the one which appeared in “Cosmic Religion.” </p>\n<p>Following medieval precedent I took considerable liberty in the arrangement of Biblical verses. I have, for example, not hesitated to add a verse from Isaiah to a chapter from the Psalms. Technical and financial reasons made it necessary to exclude many a passage which has brought me personally solace and inspiration. But Mr. Coopersmith and I regard this book an experiment. </p>\n<p>The selections are arranged under the following headings: </p>\n<p>God<br />\nTorah<br />\nIsrael<br />\nZion<br />\nThe Synagogue<br />\nThe Sabbath and Festivals<br />\nThe Sorrow-Laden Heart<br />\nThe Troubled Spirit<br />\nThe Faithful Soul<br />\nThe Arrogant Tyrant<br />\nIn the End of Days </p>\n<p>A Complete Service for Sabbath and Festivals will be found on pages 57a to 235a. I have nowhere designated special passages for responsive reading, but almost all of the selections can be utilized for the purpose. </p>\n<p>I am under great obligation to Miss Esther R. Greenburg and Mrs. A. E. Kanter for the pains they took in preparing the manuscript for publication. Without the help of my friend, Professor Samuel I. Feigen of the University of Chicago, this book could not now make its appearance. </p>\n<p>Solomon Goldman </p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
