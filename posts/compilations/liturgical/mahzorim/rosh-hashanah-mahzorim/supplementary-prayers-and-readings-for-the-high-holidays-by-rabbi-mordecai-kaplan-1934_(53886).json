    "content": "<p><em>Supplementary Prayers and Readings for the High Holidays</em> (United Synagogue, 1934) is the first prayerbook compiled by Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan. The work is comprised of two parts. The first: introductions to various parts of the Rosh haShanah and Yom Kippur services intended to deepen the understanding and engagement of participants. The second: litanies of verses, mostly biblical but some from Ben Sira (Ecclesiasticus), each litany arranged on various themes. Although the entire work is presented in English, in his foreword to the work, Rabbi Kaplan expresses his hope that they will become available in Hebrew as well in future works. This indeed came to pass with the prayerbooks published by the Jewish Reconstructionist Foundation beginning with the <em><a href=\"/?p=17387\">Sabbath Prayer Book</a></em> in 1945. </p>\n<style>\n       .errordiv { padding:10px; margin:10px; border: 1px solid #555555;color: #000000;background-color: #f8f8f8; width:500px; }#advanced_iframe {visibility:visible;opacity:1;vertical-align:top;}.ai-info-bottom-iframe { position: fixed; z-index: 10000; bottom:0; left: 0; margin: 0px; text-align: center; width: 100%; background-color: #ff9999; padding-left: 5px;padding-bottom: 5px; border-top: 1px solid #aaa } a.ai-bold {font-weight: bold;}#ai-layer-div-advanced_iframe p {height:100%;margin:0;padding:0}#ai-div-container-advanced_iframe\n       {\n           position: relative;\n           width: 100%; max-width: 100%;}\n       #ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe\n       {\n          position: absolute;\n          z-index:1000;\n          margin-left:-33px;\n          left: 50%;   top: 150px;\n         }}\n       #ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe img\n       {\n          border: none;\n       }</style><script type=\"text/javascript\">var ai_iframe_width_advanced_iframe = 0;var ai_iframe_height_advanced_iframe = 0;var aiIsIe8=false;var aiOnloadScrollTop=\"true\";var aiShowDebug=false;\n\t\tif (typeof aiReadyCallbacks === 'undefined') {\n\t\t\tvar aiReadyCallbacks = [];\n\t\t} else if (!(aiReadyCallbacks instanceof Array)) {\n\t\t\tvar aiReadyCallbacks = [];\n\t\t}    function aiShowIframeId(id_iframe) { jQuery(\"#\"+id_iframe).css(\"visibility\", \"visible\");    }    function aiResizeIframeHeight(height) { aiResizeIframeHeight(height,advanced_iframe); }    function aiResizeIframeHeightId(height,width,id) {aiResizeIframeHeightById(id,height);}</script><div id=\"ai-div-container-advanced_iframe\"><div id=\"ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-loader-icon\" src=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/plugins/advanced-iframe/img/loader.gif\" title=\"Loading\" alt=\"Loading\" /></div><iframe id=\"advanced_iframe\"  name=\"advanced_iframe\"  src=\"https://archive.org/stream/supplementary-prayers-and-readings-for-the-high-holidays-mordecai-kaplan-1934/Supplementary%20Prayers%20and%20Readings%20for%20the%20High%20Holidays%20%28Mordecai%20Kaplan%201934%29#page/n0/mode/2up\"  width=\"100%\"  height=\"900\"  frameborder=\"0\"  border=\"0\"  allowtransparency=\"true\"  loading=\"lazy\"  style=\";width:100%;height:900px;;width:1px;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;\"  allowfullscreen  onload='jQuery(&quot;#ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe&quot;).hide();;jQuery(&quot;#ai-div-loader-global&quot;).hide()' ></iframe></div><script type=\"text/javascript\">var ifrm_advanced_iframe = document.getElementById(\"advanced_iframe\");var hiddenTabsDoneadvanced_iframe = false;\nfunction resizeCallbackadvanced_iframe() {}var recalculateIframeResizeadvanced_iframe = 0;\n        var recalculateIframeOrientationchangeadvanced_iframe = 0;\n        var aiWindowWidth = 0;\n\t\tfunction recalculateIframeadvanced_iframe() {\n          clearTimeout(recalculateIframeResizeadvanced_iframe);\n          clearTimeout(recalculateIframeOrientationchangeadvanced_iframe);}\n        function initResponsiveIframeadvanced_iframe() {\n          jQuery(window).resize(function() {\n\t\t\t recalculateIframeResizeadvanced_iframe = window.setTimeout(\"recalculateIframeadvanced_iframe()\",100);\n          });\n          if (window.addEventListener) {\n            window.addEventListener(\"orientationchange\", function() {\n               recalculateIframeOrientationchangeadvanced_iframe = window.setTimeout(\"recalculateIframeadvanced_iframe()\",100);\n            }, false);\n          }\n        }\n        aiReadyCallbacks.push(initResponsiveIframeadvanced_iframe);</script><style>#advanced_iframe {width: 1px !important;min-width:100% !important;max-width:100% !important;}</style><script type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n<p>This work is in the Public Domain due to the lack of a copyright renewal by the copyright holder listed in the copyright notice (a condition required for works published in the United States between January 1st 1924 and January 1st 1964).</p>\n<hr />\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">\n<blockquote><p>\nFOREWORD</p>\n<p>In English-speaking congregations that use the traditional liturgy there are unmistakable signs of a growing demand for supplementary prayers and readings, which would translate the religious aspirations of our ancestors into terms of present-day experience. This condition is not without precedent in Jewish life. The large output of <em>piyutim</em>, or sacred verses, during the Middle Ages came in answer to a similar need. To be true to the living spirit of the Jewish religion, we should not content ourselves with past formulations of its ideals, but always seek to reformulate those ideals in terms of current situations and thought patterns. Every age should have its own <em>piyut</em>; and none should be more creative in that respect than ours. The infinite ramifications of modern life and knowledge reveal new and unsuspected implications in the religious insights of our prophets and teachers. </p>\n<p>The arrangements of Scripture verses according to specific themes, which form the second part of this booklet, are equally precedented in such selections in the daily prayers as those which begin with “O give thanks unto the Lord etc.” or “Let the glory of the Lord etc.”, and in similar selections found in devotional and selihot prayers. Though some of the readings in this booklet are of special relevance to the High Holidays, most of them are equally appropriate on Sabbaths and festivals. </p>\n<p>Both the intrinsic nature of Jewish services and the atmosphere most congenial to them logically require that all prayers and readings in the synagogue be rendered in Hebrew. It is only as an interim concession to an immediate need that those contained in this booklet are given in English. It is hoped that before long the Jewish spirit of our synagogues will be sufficiently rehabilitated to make it feasible for these prayers and readings to be published and recited in Hebrew. </p>\n<p>Grateful acknowledgment is made to the Jewish Publication Society of America for permission to use in the arrangements of the scriptural verses the version given in its translation of the Bible, to the Oxford Press for permission to use in the selections from Ben Sira the translation given in Charles’ edition of the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha, and to the Society for the Advancement of Judaism for permission to use the scriptural arrangements contained in Part Ⅱ. </p>\n<p>M.
