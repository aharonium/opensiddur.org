            "bio": "Isaac Levi (Heb: ר׳ יצחק ב״ר עקיבא | Rabbi Yitsḥaq ben Rabbi Akiva) (ca. 1770? -1839) was a teacher of Hebrew, pioneering English translator of Jewish liturgy, and an erudite Jewish scholar in England at the turn of the 19th century. Little is known of his life save that he corrected, amended, and otherwise revised the liturgical works translated by David Levi after the latter's death -- and in doing so, his translations served as the basis for many later haggadot, siddurim, and maḥzorim. On title pages, he is sometimes listed as a \"professor and teacher of the Hebrew language.\" As he was not appointed to any university, this likely means that he taught or tutored Christian Hebraists and other interested students. Details provided to Avraham Roos by Henry Roche indicate that he left the publishing world in the mid-1830s to work under H.R.H Duke of Sussex as a Hebraist responsible for the Duke's library of Hebrew manuscripts. Roos notes that his use of the word <span class=\"hebrew\">ענגלאטירא</span> ('English') attests to French influence. Roche notes that despite his surname Levi, Isaac was not a Levite. With his wife Esther, Isaac had five children. We know that over the course of his life he spent time in London and Portsmouth. Roos speculates that the likely cause of Isaac Levi's name being left off of works by David Levi that the former had amended, was probably due to a commercial dispute in the early 1830s with the printer Hyam Barnett (c. 1763–1845). Isaac Levi's date of birth is not yet known, but we can surmise it to be in the mid- to late 18th century. If you know any more about Isaac Levi's life and career, please <a href=\"/contact/\">contact us</a>. (Many thanks to Avraham Roos and Henry Roche for the details so far discovered.)",

Since the English Jewish community of the time knew little or no Hebrew, Levi translated the Sefaradi and Ashkenazi prayer books, and produced expositions and translations of much Jewish lore about ritual and practice. His texts were used by Jewish and Christian writers well into the 19th century.",

These urged the late David Levi, to make a new translation of them. It has been the study of the Reviser carefully to examine and correct the errors which have crept into former editions; and the whole has been restored to that system of religious animated invocation so elegantly laid down in the original. </p>\n<p>To promote the interest of our religion, and to stir up our youth, as well as those of maturer age, to tread in the steps of their ancestors, who were so eminent for the preservation of their religious principles, is certainly an object ardently to be desired. And no way so calculated for this purpose, as a due observance of our constant prayers in our approaches to the supreme Being. </p>\n<p>At the bottom of several pages an additional explanatory note is given, elucidating such alterations as have been made by the corrector. </p>\n<p>THE REVISER [Isaac Levi]\n</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
