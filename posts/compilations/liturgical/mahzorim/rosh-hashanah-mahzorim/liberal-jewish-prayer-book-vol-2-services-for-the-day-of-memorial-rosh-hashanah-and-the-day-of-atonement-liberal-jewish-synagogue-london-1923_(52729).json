            "bio": "Rabbi Israel Isidore Mattuck (1884–1954) was a leader of the Liberal (Reform movement) in the United Kingfom. Born in Lithuania, he came as a child to the United States with his family and grew up in Worcester, Massachusetts. A graduate of Harvard University, he was ordained at the Hebrew Union College in 1910 having only spent two years in residence. He held a pulpit in Far Rockaway, New York, for a year and then went to England to serve a young congregation, the Liberal Synagogue in London. He served as senior minister for 36 years and then after 1947 was minister emeritus. Under his leadership the synagogue grew into one of the largest synagogues in London. The building that he helped build was bombed in World War II, but Mattuck lived to see it restored and rededicated. He was succeeded by his disciple and son-in-law Rabbi Leslie Edgar. He was a leading figure, perhaps the leading figure in English Liberal Jewry, its philosopher and its public face. He was known as one of the \"Three Ms\": Montagu, Montefiore, and Mattuck. He helped form the Union of Liberal and Progressive Synagogues and helped establish the World Union for Progressive Judaism in 1926 and served as its first chairman from 1926 until his death. He was chairman of the Society of Jews and Christians. He compiled and edited the Liberal prayer book, first in three volumes in 1923–26 and in a revised edition in 1937. He is the author of several books: <em>What Are the Jews</em> (1939); <em>The Essentials of Liberal Judaism</em> (1947); <em>Jewish Ethics</em> (1953); and <em>The Thought of the Prophets</em> (1953). He also edited <em>Aspects of Progressive Jewish Thought</em> (1955), which was dedicated in honor of Leo Baeck's 80th birthday. It was published posthumously.",

Some of the prayers and‏ hymns, and almost all of the Memorial Service, have been‏ taken from that book, and our thanks are due to the‏ Central Conference of American Rabbis, who, through‏ their executive officers, gave us permission to do this.‏ Thanks are also due to the Jewish Publication Society‏ of America for permission to use the hymn on page 121;‏ to the Trustees of the Arthur Davis Memorial Fund for‏ permission to use some of the translations in <em>Service‏ of the Synagogue</em>; to the West London Synagogue of‏ British Jews for the prayers adapted from their Prayer‏ Book; and to Mrs. Alice Lucas for the poems on pages 172‏ and 212 taken from her <em>Jewish Year</em>. What has been‏ taken or adapted from these sources is set out in detail in‏ the Appendix. The traditional Ashkenazi and Sephardi‏ prayer books, and the Bible (Revised Version), have‏ contributed the larger portions of nearly all the Services.‏ The Appendix shows the source of each prayer, or group‏ of prayers, except those Bible passages whose several‏ sources are indicated in the text. Many of the prayers‏ are new, having been specially written for these‏ services; they are indicated in the Appendix.‏ </p>\n<p>The English that accompanies the Hebrew prayers contains, in most cases, a paraphrase—not a translation—of the Hebrew. Sometimes it also enlarges the meaning of a Hebrew phrase or sentence. </p>\n<p>Circumstances have necessitated the publication of Volume Ⅱ,.—that is this book—of our Services before Volume Ⅰ. That volume, will, it is hoped, be published soon. It will contain the Services for the Sabbath, the Festivals, and for other occasions; also an introduction to the Prayer Book, explaining the principles and ideas which guided its compilation. </p>\n<p>London, July, 1923.\n</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
