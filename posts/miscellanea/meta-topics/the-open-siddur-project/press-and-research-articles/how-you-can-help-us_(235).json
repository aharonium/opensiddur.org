The title, hierophant, originated in Ancient Greece and combines the words <span lang=\"el\">φαίνω</span> (<em>phainein</em>, \"to show\") and <span lang=\"el\">‏τα ειρα</span> (<em>ta hiera</em>, \"the holy\"); hierophants served as interpreters of sacred mysteries and arcane principles. For the Open Siddur Project, the Hierophant welcomes new contributors and explains <a href=\"http://opensiddur.org/development/mission\">our mission</a>: ensuring creatively inspired work intended for communal use is shared freely for creative reuse and redistribution.",
