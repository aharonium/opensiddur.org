First post!</p>\n<p>Over the course of the summer I will be in Jerusalem attending the <a href=\"http://www.presentense.org/\">PresenTense Institute</a>&#8216;s <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20160331171421/http://presentense.org/institute/about\">summer workshop</a>. Before I arrived I set in mind an intention, (or <em>kavvanah</em>, as it were) to achieve the following goals:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>gaining expert understanding of the licensing and technical challenges for developing partnerships between creative projects founded on works in the public domain</li>\n<li>learning about how to manage and sustain non-commercial open source projects, and</li>\n<li>cultivating relationships with future partners and users of the Open Siddur and its affiliate projects.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
