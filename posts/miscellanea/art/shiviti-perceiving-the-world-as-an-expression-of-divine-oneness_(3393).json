In 1984, Meit earned a Bachelor of Arts in Religious Studies with minors in Mathematics and Philosophy from Stetson University. As a lifelong creative, he is a type and graphics designer focusing on <a href=\"https://www.associationforjewishstudies.org/artists-on-their-art-andrew-meit\">Jewish art</a> and digitally repairing damaged art. \r\n\r\nMeit is legally deaf-blind, and has several learning problems stemming from contracting congenital Rubella. He is active in the Independent Living Movement; been on several CIL boards. Throughout his life Meit has striven to turn his disabilities into well-made art that inspires and celebrates beauty and truth.\r\n\r\nOff and on for 40 years, Meit has been involved in interfaith services and study groups. He has informally lectured on Buber. He enjoys writing prayers and creating worship presentations.\r\n\r\nAlthough mainly self-taught in calligraphy, drawing and design, Meit formally studied at the Cleveland Art Institute. With the font editor Fontographer, he recreated the well known font GoodCity Modern (a faithful recreation of the Gutenberg’s bible typeface). Over the decades, he produced a digital recreation of the first page of Genesis from the Gutenberg Bible. He artistically colored many of E.M. Lilien’s line art illustrations, created a font based on Buber's handwriting, and recently, he created a new logo for the Florida Orange City <a href=\"https://mosaicuuc.org\">Unitarian Universalist Congregation</a> and improved a logo for Applied Jewish Spirituality group.  \r\n\r\nMeit likes to help repair the world through his art; enjoys deep thoughts, playing with puzzles, and learning about Religion. He currently lives in Plantation, Florida.",

This ambiguity is at the root of the tradition of the <em>Shiviti</em>, a recursive illustration of the verse&#8217;s meaning set as a visual meditation and reminder. Because the object of any given practice is to condition behavior through repetition, the practice of perceiving the world as an expression of divine Oneness can begin as soon as one gains consciousness, and this is where Psalms 16:8 enters into the morning liturgy. Shmueli Gonzales explains more in his post on the <a href=\"https://hardcoremesorah.wordpress.com/2011/05/18/sheviti-hashem-the-unspoken-declaration/\"><em>Shiviti</em></a>,</p>\n<blockquote><p>Those of you who have visited any Jewish shrines know exactly what I’m talking about when I mention charts and mystical diagrams. We call them <em>Shiviti</em> and they often take on the form on an enlarged writing of the Four-Letter name surrounded by verses of Psalms or prayers. The most famous of these is probably <a href=\"http://hardcoremesorah.wordpress.com/2011/04/28/sefirat-haomer-the-kavanah-of-psalm-67/\">Psalms 67</a> drawn in the shape of a menorah. Others incorporate many mystical ways of reading Divine Names, but that are not meant to be pronounced. </p>\n<p>Now one might ask, how intrusive into the text of the siddur can these mandala like meditations be? I mean, if they are useful why are they left out of the <em>Baal haTanya</em>’s siddur? You might say, who is he to leave out these things that are so authentic and sacred? Well, if we use a siddur as a <em>seder</em> (an order) of prayers and devotions, and go through it from waking up to going to sleep, then the first occurrence of <em>shiviti</em> is at the beginning of the siddur. That’s right. When one wakes up they are to immediately have in mind this verse “I have set <em>haShem</em> before me at all times.” For this reason in many Sephardic and Edut haMizrach siddurim the first words you will see is these words “<em>shiviti Hashem l’negdi tamid</em>.” [Read more at Shmuel&#8217;s blog, <a href=\"https://hardcoremesorah.wordpress.com/2011/05/18/sheviti-hashem-the-unspoken-declaration/\">Hardcore Mesorah</a>.]</p></blockquote>\n<p>This particular <em>shiviti</em> was originally drawn by a <em>sopher</em> (scribe) in Israel under the pseudonym, <a href=\"http://cafe.themarker.com/user/190191/\">בעל הכוכב</a> and <a href=\"http://cafe.themarker.com/image/659040/\">shared on a popular message board</a> with the intention &#8220;** חובה בכל בית **&#8221; &#8212; &#8220;It&#8217;s a duty [to place this] in every home.&#8221;  Thank you to Andrew Meit for converting this <em>shiviti</em> from a raster image to a vector art SVG.
