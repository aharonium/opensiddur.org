As soon as he saw them, he ran from the entrance of the tent to greet them and, bowing to the ground, he said, “My lords, if it please you, do not go on past your servant.

The Talmud, playing on the double meaning of the word “<em>adonai</em>” as both “my lords” and “my Lord,” suggests that Abraham at first was addressing not the passers by, but God, of Whom Abraham was begging leave to attend to the immediate human needs before him. Yet even as it proposes this reading, the Talmud seems to recognize the audacity of so doing:</p>\n<blockquote><p>R.

Even today we continue to be exercised over the relationship between religion and ethics. Now, it should be obvious to the most casual observer that Jewish ethical attitudes and behaviors are deeply informed—directed—by explicitly religious teaching. It is true, though, that many of our most important interpersonal acts appear to be “secular&#8221;—that is, there is nothing about them which would visibly mark them or their performers as connected to an experience of the sacred. Like Abraham, we appear to turn away from God when we attend to the human needs before us.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nWhy is there this disjuncture between the sensibility informing the act and the act itself? What does this disjuncture do to our own attempts to lead integrated lives, to know at all times before Whom we stand, to set God perpetually before us even as we carry out the work of caring for God’s creatures? Indeed, some modern thinkers have recognized a void which they believe ought to be filled. They have suggested adding blessings to bring to the fore what has become the forgotten background to these events.<span class=\"footnote_referrer\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_3');\" onkeypress=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_3');\" ><sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_3\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\">[3]</sup></a><span id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_3\" class=\"footnote_tooltip\"> See especially Allen Kensky, “Is There a Blessing on Feeding the Homeless” <em>Conservative Judaism</em> XLIII:4 (Summer 1991) pp. 66-72, and the discussion in Arthur Waskow, <em>Down-to-Earth Judaism</em> (New York: William Morrow, 1995), pp. 231-239.&nbsp;</span></span><script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery('#footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_3').tooltip({ tip: '#footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_3', tipClass: 'footnote_tooltip', effect: 'fade', predelay: 0, fadeInSpeed: 200, delay: 400, fadeOutSpeed: 200, position: 'center right', relative: true, offset: [0, 0], });</script>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nIt is worth our while to spend a few words on the subject of blessings, for berakhot are our primary vehicle for ritualizing or concretizing our encounter with God. Our enjoyment, for example, of the bounties of Creation is transformed from being a purely creaturely experience by the discipline of berakhot. Anyone can delight in a flower, and even an animal can appreciate food, but only <em>homo religiosus</em> can link the creation to the Creator. And so we say “<em>Barukh atah</em>, Blessed are You . . . who creates the fruit of the tree” before eating the apple. But having said that, what have we said? Or rather, what have we done?\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nUnlike Christian forms of Grace (e.g., “Bless this food to our use”), Jewish berakhot almost always ignore the specific occasion in favor of the general (“Blessed are You . . . who brings bread from the earth”). That is, the blessing is less about the particular morsel than about God’s eternal attribute of provider of which this piece of bread is a synecdoche. Nevertheless—and this is crucial—the blessing only functions “truthfully” when said as a response to the particular phenomenon. To say the blessing over bread out of a desire to express gratitude and awe for God’s general role as bread-giver, when one is not actually about to eat, is an instance of a “blessing in vain.” A blessing, then, is umbilically linked to an actual experience, and yet with great deliberation it turns our attention away from that experience.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nBlessings are commonly understood to be moments of acclamation: “The uniqueness of a blessing is that it is pure praise, asking nothing of God but rather giving us an opportunity to remind ourselves of God&#8217;s presence and of the ways in which we experience Him in the world.”<span class=\"footnote_referrer\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_4');\" onkeypress=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_4');\" ><sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_4\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\">[4]</sup></a><span id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_4\" class=\"footnote_tooltip\"> Reuven Hammer, <em>Entering Jewish Prayer</em> (New York: Schocken Books, 1994), p. 25.&nbsp;</span></span><script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery('#footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_4').tooltip({ tip: '#footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_4', tipClass: 'footnote_tooltip', effect: 'fade', predelay: 0, fadeInSpeed: 200, delay: 400, fadeOutSpeed: 200, position: 'center right', relative: true, offset: [0, 0], });</script> While this represents perhaps the most common understanding of a blessing, I am not sure that we should let it go unexamined.

Strong, valiant, sure and honored&#8230;” [R. Hanina] waited until he had finished, and then said to him, “Have you finished all the praises of your Master? What use is all this to me?

What is more of a problem is that, for the various categories, there is frequently no reason for why a certain type of act should not require a blessing. Perhaps the most compelling of the answers Abudraham cites is that of Abraham ibn David of Posquiérs, the Ravad, who argues that it would be inappropriate to say a blessing when pain or degradation are involved, either when it is the result of the act (giving a bill of divorce, inflicting capital punishment) or when it is the stimulus for the act (comforting mourners, visiting the sick). While there is, as I hope to show, a connection between blessings and human dignity, even this explanation is incomplete. Not only because it fails to account for those actions where no pain at all is involved (such as rising before the aged, honoring parents, bringing joy to a bride and groom), but because it seems to fly in the face of the injunction cited above to acknowledge God’s presence even and especially in moments of pain.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nWhat is clear is that whether or not God is acknowledged as present in the face of suffering, we are certainly called to be present.

We have observed as well that acts of justice and mercy, as religious acts, are rooted in an openness to the presence of a human other. This suggests that a common dynamic, and perhaps the central dynamic of religious life, is the emulation of tzimtzum: the making room in one’s own space for a different subjectivity. The refusal to respond to a beggar is linked to idolatry because there is no essential difference between erecting a wall against one’s fellow and erecting a wall against God. The experience of an other subject creates a demand upon us by its very presence to make room, to respond. Whether the encounter is with a beggar or a bride or the “I” revealed in the first of the Ten Commandments, every encounter contains within it a call, a mitsvah, to make room, to approach, to act.<span class=\"footnote_referrer\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_32');\" onkeypress=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_32');\" ><sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_32\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\">[32]</sup></a><span id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_32\" class=\"footnote_tooltip\"> And so, even if all that was heard at Sinai was the first commandment, or the first word of the first commandment, or the silent “<em>aleph</em>” that begins that first commandment (Mendel of Rymanov, cited in Gershom Scholem, <em>On the Kabbalah and Its Symbolism</em> (New York Schocken Books, 1969), p. 30, that alone would be sufficient to establish an experience of “command.” See also Scholem&#8217;s referrence to Rosenzweig there (&#8220;The only immediate content of revelation&#8230; is revelation itself”), and also Buber’s understanding that “The soul of the decalogue, however, is to be found in the word &#8220;Thou&#8217;&#8230; At all times, in any case, only those persons really grasped the decalogue who literally felt it as having been addressed to themselves, only those, that is, who experienced that first one’s state of being addressed as though they themselves were being addressed.” Quoted in Will Herberg, ed., <em>The Writings of Martin Buber</em> (New York: New American Library, 1974), pp. 192-193.&nbsp;</span></span><script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery('#footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_32').tooltip({ tip: '#footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_32', tipClass: 'footnote_tooltip', effect: 'fade', predelay: 0, fadeInSpeed: 200, delay: 400, fadeOutSpeed: 200, position: 'center right', relative: true, offset: [0, 0], });</script> A religious or spiritual personality is one which is open to those encounters, those calls. Both berakhot and ethics can function as disciplines for cultivating that openness. Both are necessary, and each leads to the other. For even if we think we are turning away from God, whenever we turn in openness to the presence of an other, we find that we have turned to the Divine Other as well.
