I hope to show that not only are we not required (or even expected) to believe in the content of the liturgy, but that the very word “content” is ill-chosen.

In fact, the breach is nothing new.</p>\n<p>Past generations have intoned many prayers which defied literal acceptance&#8230;.

The most famous example of this is almost a cliché, but I think we need to take it seriously:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A person must say a blessing (<em>ḥayyav ‘adam l&#8217;varekh</em>) upon the evil just as one says a blessing upon the good.<span class=\"footnote_referrer\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_5');\" onkeypress=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_5');\" ><sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_5\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\">[5]</sup></a><span id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_5\" class=\"footnote_tooltip\"> Mishnah Berakhot 9:5 (= Berakhot 60b).&nbsp;</span></span><script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery('#footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_5').tooltip({ tip: '#footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_5', tipClass: 'footnote_tooltip', effect: 'fade', predelay: 0, fadeInSpeed: 200, delay: 400, fadeOutSpeed: 200, position: 'center right', relative: true, offset: [0, 0], });</script></p></blockquote>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\">\nThe force of this injunction is in the word evil, <em>ra’ah</em>. Evil is frequently a subjective term, but even those things which are subjectively bad must first be recognized as such if a person is to say the appropriate blessing. By referring to something as evil, the mishnah specifically points to an event which is <em>not recognized</em> as being a product of God&#8217;s justice; else it would not he called “evil,” but rather “just,” or “hard,” or “painful.” This mishnah could be rephrased as, “Precisely when you feel least like saying a blessing, you must say a blessing.” An even more interesting, and less well-known, example found in the Tosefta.

The traditional assumption that the one who said “<em>modim modim</em>” was silenced because it might appear that he was acknowledging two divinities is perhaps deserving of reconsideration. It appears as an explanation neither here nor in the parallel in Megillah 4:9 (in which some other prohibited formulations are explained, however), It is not raised as an issue in any of the attributed discussion in the Bavli (Berakhot 33b-34a and Megillah 25a); R. Zeira compares it to saying “<em>Sh&#8217;ma sh’ma</em>,” and Rav Papa suggests that it was the result of a momentary lapse of <em>kavvanah</em>. It is not mentioned at all in the Yerushalmi (Berakhot 5:3: Megillah 4:10); while R. Shmuel bar R. Yitzhak does apply the verse “the mouth of the liars is stopped&#8221; (Psalms 63:12) to the three cases in M. Berakhot, the Yerushalmi adds that the prohibition only applies (to the leader?) in public prayer, and in Megillah it continues by comparing the repetition to saying “<em>amen amen</em>” and “<em>sh’ma sh’ma</em>.” Indeed, the only appearance of the issue is in an apparently late layer of the sugya, where it is mentioned by the stam by way of introducing an argument concerning an earlier part of the mishnah. That even that part of the mishnah may not have been concerned with heresy is suggested by Halivni in his commentary on the Megillah parallel (<em>Mekorot Umesorot: Mo‘ed: M&#8217;yoma &#8216;ad Ḥagigah</em> (Jerusalem: JTSA with the Gustav Wurzweiler Foundation, 1975) pp. 508ff).&nbsp;</span></span><script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery('#footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_11').tooltip({ tip: '#footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_11', tipClass: 'footnote_tooltip', effect: 'fade', predelay: 0, fadeInSpeed: 200, delay: 400, fadeOutSpeed: 200, position: 'center right', relative: true, offset: [0, 0], });</script> You may even pray in a language you don’t understand (Hebrew).

Quite the contrary. The emphasis, though, is on the word “experience.” For while a directed, repeated, recital of a series of texts structured neither by propositional nor narrative logic may be of no help to the intellect and understanding, it is very good for the emotions and empathy. Consider this parallel from classical Athens:</p>\n<blockquote><p>[The emphasis on memorization and recital] meant that the young were involved emotionally and subjectively with the content of their discourses to a degree we would find difficult to grasp. . . . Athenian youth were concerned to reproduce their literature, not reflect upon it.

Moreover, the point is not to understand the cry, but to empathize with the crier. This means that we must approach each cry from the inside out, as it were: we must find, or imagine, what the cries meant <em>to the person who uttered them</em>, and what gave rise to their utterance.

They do not appear in <em>Siddur Sim Shalom</em>. Instead, there is a single blessing in which the (male or female) worshipper thanks God for having created him or her in God&#8217;s own image. Now, it would seem to be a desideratum for people to delight in being who and what they are, and in not being otherwise. I should, in theory, be able to recite the original formula in good faith, just as I am able to thank my Creator that I am not taller or better looking or more talented than I am. Similarly, I would have no hesitation about rejoicing for being made according to the designs of God&#8217;s very will. Yet while the blessings are in no way dishonest, they are both inappropriate. Certainly in an egalitarian community it makes no sense to have a different <em>kind</em> of blessing for men and women. The issue is not equality, though.

The traditional assumption that the one who said “<em>modim modim</em>” was silenced because it might appear that he was acknowledging two divinities is perhaps deserving of reconsideration. It appears as an explanation neither here nor in the parallel in Megillah 4:9 (in which some other prohibited formulations are explained, however), It is not raised as an issue in any of the attributed discussion in the Bavli (Berakhot 33b-34a and Megillah 25a); R. Zeira compares it to saying “<em>Sh&#8217;ma sh’ma</em>,” and Rav Papa suggests that it was the result of a momentary lapse of <em>kavvanah</em>. It is not mentioned at all in the Yerushalmi (Berakhot 5:3: Megillah 4:10); while R. Shmuel bar R. Yitzhak does apply the verse “the mouth of the liars is stopped&#8221; (Psalms 63:12) to the three cases in M. Berakhot, the Yerushalmi adds that the prohibition only applies (to the leader?) in public prayer, and in Megillah it continues by comparing the repetition to saying “<em>amen amen</em>” and “<em>sh’ma sh’ma</em>.” Indeed, the only appearance of the issue is in an apparently late layer of the sugya, where it is mentioned by the stam by way of introducing an argument concerning an earlier part of the mishnah. That even that part of the mishnah may not have been concerned with heresy is suggested by Halivni in his commentary on the Megillah parallel (<em>Mekorot Umesorot: Mo‘ed: M&#8217;yoma &#8216;ad Ḥagigah</em> (Jerusalem: JTSA with the Gustav Wurzweiler Foundation, 1975) pp. 508ff).</td></tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"footnotes_plugin_reference_row\"> <th scope=\"row\" id=\"footnote_plugin_reference__1_12\" class=\"footnote_plugin_index pointer\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor__1('footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_12');\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"footnote_plugin_link\" >12</a></th> <td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">Postman, p. 34.</td></tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"footnotes_plugin_reference_row\"> <th scope=\"row\" id=\"footnote_plugin_reference__1_13\" class=\"footnote_plugin_index pointer\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor__1('footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_13');\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"footnote_plugin_link\" >13</a></th> <td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">This is not just a philosophic observation, but a halakhic requirement: it is not sufficient for person to think or read a prayer silently, it must actually be voiced.</td></tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"footnotes_plugin_reference_row\"> <th scope=\"row\" id=\"footnote_plugin_reference__1_14\" class=\"footnote_plugin_index pointer\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor__1('footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_14');\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"footnote_plugin_link\" >14</a></th> <td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">Berakhot 31a.</td></tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"footnotes_plugin_reference_row\"> <th scope=\"row\" id=\"footnote_plugin_reference__1_15\" class=\"footnote_plugin_index pointer\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor__1('footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_15');\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"footnote_plugin_link\" >15</a></th> <td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">Jules Harlow, editor, <em>Siddur Sim Shalom</em> (New York: The Rabbinical Assembly of America and the United Synagogue of America, 1985) p. 435.</td></tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"footnotes_plugin_reference_row\"> <th scope=\"row\" id=\"footnote_plugin_reference__1_16\" class=\"footnote_plugin_index pointer\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor__1('footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_16');\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"footnote_plugin_link\" >16</a></th> <td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">Richard A.
