Later, however, consideration was given to the fact that most people were unable to compose their prayers or adequately to give expression to their feelings and desires. Statutory evening, morning, and afternoon prayers were, therefore, composed for weekdays, Sabbaths, and festivals, and special prayers for all forms of joyful and mournful occasions. Many additions to these were made in the course of the centuries. Thus the authoritative Siddur came into existence.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\">\n<h4>The First Siddurim</h4>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\">\nThe main structure of our Prayer Books is attributed to Rav Amram Gaon whose Siddur is the earliest known. It contains prayers that have their origin in the Holy Scriptures, the Talmud, later Jewish sources and many later additions. Compiled in Babylon, the authority of this Siddur was also acknowledged by the Jewish communities in Spain from where it found its way to the Jews [in] Italy.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\">\nAbout seventy years later a Siddur was compiled by Rav Saadiah Gaon, principal of the Sura academy in Babylon (882-942), and this was followed by that of Rashi (1040-1105), but neither of these succeeded in gaining the status or popularity of the Siddur of Rav Amram Gaon. A disciple of Rashi, Rabbi Simchah ben Rabbi Samuel of Vitry in France (d. 1105) has to his credit the most important early Siddur, the basis of the Ashkenazic form of the prayers. It quotes extensively from the Siddurim of Rav Amram, Rav Saadiah and others and is ten times the size of the Siddurim that preceded it.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\">\nII.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\">\n<h4>Beginnings of Prayer</h4>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\">\nPrayers are found to have been in use as early as Bible times, having been recorded in the Pentateuch, the Prophets, and the Hagiorgrapha. Abraham, to quote a few examples, prayed on behalf of the men of Sodom (Genesis 18:23-33) and Abimelech Gen. 20:17). Jacob prayed for delivery from his brother Esau (Gen 32:9-12). Joshua turned to God in prayer after the defeat at Ai (Jos. 7:6); Samuel, when the people insisted on the appointment of a king (I Sam 12:23); Jonah in the belly of the fish (Jon. 2:1-9); Daniel, for the restoration from exile (Dan. 9:3-19); and Nehemiah, for the salvation of the returned exiles (Ezra 9:6-15).\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\">\n<h4>Congregational Prayer</h4>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\">\nPublic or congregational prayer may be traced from the time of the First Temple when king Solomon offered in public his prayer of the dedication of the Temple and included in it thanksgiving, supplication, and confession (I Kings 8:12-23).\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\">\nIt is difficult, however, to decide when exactly congregational prayer, in the form now used, was first instituted, but there can hardly be any doubt that our liturgy began to take shape while the Second Temple still flourished in Jerusalem.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\">\nWe know that the Shema (Deuteronomy 6:4-9; 11:13-21; and Numbers 15:37-41), which we now read twice daily, and the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:1-17 and Deuteronomy 5:6-18) were recited in the Temple every morning (Tamid 5.1) and that, while the priests offered the sacrifices, the Levites sang psalms and other songs, penitent sinners made confession, and the other worshippers joined in prayers.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\">\nThe Eighteen Benedictions (Shemoneh Esreh) or, at least, their first three and last three were composed in the second century B.C.E., i.e. before the Maccabean era, while the benedictions of Ahavah Rabbah (“With abounding love”), which precedes the morning Shema, and Emeth veyateiv (“True and firm&#8221;), which follows it, have also a very early origin.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\">\n<h4>Voluntary and Obligatory Prayers</h4>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\">\nIn the days of the First Temple prayer was a voluntary act.

R. Chiyya bar Ashi in the name of Rav (219-247) said, “Any one who is not in a settled state of mind must not pray” (Erubin 65a). Prayer must not be treated as a set task but as petition and supplication to the omnipresent (Aboth 2.18). “Prepare to meet thy God, O Israel” (Amos 4:12) was the origin of the custom of the “pious of ancient times” who spent one hour in preparation for prayer (Berachoth 5.1). One of Ezra’s ordinances was the scrupulous washing of the body immediately before prayer (Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 3.4). Attention must be paid to the clothing one wears during prayer. One Talmudic sage, accordingly, put a mantle over his shoulders and crossed his hands in reverence “like a servant in the presence of his master” (Shabbath 10a). Another sage wore red garters whenever he offered his prayers.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\">\n<h4>Efficacy of Prayer</h4>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\">\nThroughout Scripture the Efficacy of prayer is taken for granted. Moses, for instance, by his prayer removed plagues from Egypt (Exodus 8:29, 31) and healed the leprosy of his sister Miriam (Numbers 12:13-14). Elijah’s prayer revived an apparently dead child (I Kings 17:20) and so did the prayer of his disciple Elisha in a similar emergency (I Kings 4:33). When the people of Nineveh were doomed to destruction, they were saved by their prayers, fasting and repentance (Jonah 3:10). Similar examples of the efficacy of prayer are scattered all over the pages of the Talmudic literature.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\">\n<h4>Equality of Rich and Poor</h4>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\">\nAlthough the prayers are a substitute for the Temple sacrifices, they are esteemed to be not only of equal, but of higher value (Berachoth 60a). All men are equal in the sight of God and, therefore, the prayer of the poor is as precious as that of the great Moses and even more efficacious (Zohar Vayishlach 168b). Psalm 90 describes the prayer of Moses as “Tefillah leMosheh” (Prayer of Moses), and the same description is used for the prayer of the poor man, “Tefillah leani” (Prayer of the poor man) in Psalm 102, on which the Midrash (Shemoth Rabbah 21.4) comments, “Zu tefillah vezu tefillah” (This is prayer and the other is equally prayer).\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\">\nV.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\">\n<h4>Content and Aim</h4>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\">\nOur present Prayer Book embraces supplications and praise, confession and thanksgiving, hymns and psalms, besides many selections from Holy Scripture, the Mishnah and the Talmud.

These two volumes were re-published soon after Rabbi Bosniak&#8217;s death by Pardes Publishing House Inc., in 1964. In addition to this introduction, Pardes also included translations made by Dr. Slotki of <em>Pirkei Avot</em> and of the hymn, <em>Anim Zemirot</em>, as well as some liturgical commentary. With this material included, Pardes revised the page numbers in their eprinting). </p>\n<p>I was unaware that Dr. Slotki had written anything on the Siddur or Jewish liturgy beyond <em>Key to the Siddur</em> (1947), a grammar book for liturgical Hebrew published alongside Rabbi Joseph H. Hertz&#8217;s annotated <em><a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/compilations/siddurim/kol-bo/seder-tefilot-kol-hashanah-by-joseph-herman-hertz-1942-1945/\">Authorised Daily Prayer Book</a></em> (Revised edition, 1942-1945/1948). It may very well be the case that this introduction was originally written for but not included in the aforementioned <em>Key to the Siddur</em>.</p>\n<p>Because this work of a major scholar is so obscure, and the heir to the estate of Dr. Slotki so difficult to determine, I have reprinted his concise &#8220;Introduction [to the Siddur]&#8221; here under my Fair Use Right so that other&#8217;s may benefit from it. (Without explicit permission from Slotki&#8217;s heirs the work will remain under copyright in the United States until 2043, seventy years after the author&#8217;s death.) The actual text seems to me to have been edited from a larger manuscript almost certainly written before 1964.
