            "bio": "The Hon. Lilian Helen \"Lily\" Montagu, CBE (22 December 1873 – 22 January 1963) was the first woman to play a major role in Progressive Judaism. Until the age of 15, she was educated at Doreck College, and privately educated thereafter. In 1893 she founded with Emily Marion Harris the West Central Jewish Girls Club (which subsequently merged into the Jewish Girls' Brigade). She was active in social improvement, particularly in respect to unemployment, sweat shops and bad housing. In 1901 and 1902, Montagu laid the groundwork for the establishment of the Jewish Religious Union in London. In February 1902 she arranged the first meeting of the Jewish Religious Union for the Advancement of Liberal Judaism at her sister Henrietta Franklin's house. The Union set up the first synagogue in Liberal Judaism in the UK and helped found the World Union for Progressive Judaism. Montagu was a founding member with her sister of the Jewish League for Woman Suffrage. She sat on the executive committee and led the meetings in prayer. Following the retirement of Leo Baeck, Montagu served for a brief stint (1955–1959) in her 80s as president of the World Union for Progressive Judaism, before handing the reins over to Solomon Freehof.",

Some of you ask: &#8220;Why pray? What is the good of it?&#8221;\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nI think we need to pray. We are incomplete without contact with the living God &#8211; and that is what prayer means. We are beings created by the living Spirit of Goodness, Truth, Love and Justice, who wish to return and draw from our source renewed energy with which to carry on our lives. We pray, then, for the increase of our spiritual power. We need sustenance and exercise for our spirits, quite as much as we need food and gymnastics for our body. We meditate on God&#8217;s law of righteousness, and the desire to be better and to do better fills our hearts. Why pray? We pray in the first place that we may live more fully.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nWe are all conscious of some wrong doing in our lives which separates us from God. We pray for the power to overcome evil in ourselves, and to become one with God. We are each of us directly responsible for the conduct of our lives. We have to destroy the wrong by our own efforts. The consciousness that God is real &#8211; that something of His spirit is in our hearts, even while, in its perfection, it is the supreme life force in the universe, this faith gives us the power to overcome sin, for it makes our will strong and directed towards good. We pray, therefore in the second place for self advancement in righteousness.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nAs we pray, we feel ourselves united with every aspiring human being; his life and well being are part of our own lives. We understand his needs, for we actually share them, and so the third blessing which we discover in praying is the unity of mankind.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nBut we would like to alter the world? we would wish to see some of the evils and misery, cruelty and injustice swept away. So we pray for the removal of evil, though it still persists and sometimes seems to grow in magnitude. What then is the good of praying?\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nThe good lies in another direction. In prayer, we realise the value and power of human personality. We pray, and the possibility of achievement is unveiled before our eyes. We can choose good and reject evil. That is our human prerogative. The same privilege belongs to the men and women who are in positions of great power and responsibility. We would not surrender the freedom of human personality. When we pray we show the connection between belief and conduct.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nFreedom is part of the human inheritance. Prayer has revealed the power of man to create the better world through obedience and loyalty to the laws of God. It is for us to help in establishing the kingdom. We must not ask God to do it for us, and so surrender our human independence. He has offered us the power to work with Him.

Why then, we ask, does not God hear? I believe that God does hear, and it is well for us to think of our dear ones when we are considering the reality of God in prayer. Let us seek from His revelation ways to increase our wisdom and our power of loving. Perhaps we shall lose some of our selfishness and our ability to give pain. But when things don&#8217;t do right, as we believe, for our beloved, we must remember the limitation of our vision and that what seems evil to us may in the end be good.
