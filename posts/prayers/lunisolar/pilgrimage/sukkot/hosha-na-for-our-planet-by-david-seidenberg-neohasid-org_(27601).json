With <em>smikhah</em> (ordination) from the Jewish Theological Seminary and from <a href=\"/profile/zalman-schachter-shalomi/\">Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi</a>, he has taught at over 100 synagogues, communities, retreats and conferences across North America (and a few in Europe and Israel). Rabbi Seidenberg's teaching empowers learners to become creators of Judaism through deep study and communion with texts and tradition. Areas of specialty include Kabbalah and Ḥasidut, Talmud, davenning, evolution and cosmology, sustainability, Maimonides, Buber, and more. Rabbi Seidenberg has <a href=\"http://neohasid.org/about/pub\">published widely</a> on ecology and Judaism and is the author of <em>Kabbalah and Ecology: God's Image in the More-Than-Human World</em> (Cambridge University Press, 2015).",

    "content": "<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\" style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">\nI was first inspired to write a Hoshana for the planet related to ills we are facing today by the protests against the Dakota access pipeline (DAPL) in 2016. The native American-led protest camp was one of the more extraordinary environmental actions of the decade. The Dakota pipeline protest focused on protecting sacred water as well as sacred land, both important themes of Sukkot.</p>\n<p>The Hoshanah I wrote (&#8220;A Hoshana for our planet&#8221;) focused especially on aspects of climate change like drought, flooding, and ocean acidification and on other impacts of oil and gas, though it also includes a few other ecosystem threats that we face today, as well as a plea for refugees. Similar to traditional Hoshanot, this Hoshana goes (approximately) in alphabetical order, though I don&#8217;t try to hit every letter.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"/?p=27609\">second liturgy</a>, a cycle of seven Hoshanot roughly corresponding to the days of creation, was written more recently. It includes climate change issues and extinctions, but also more general appreciations and prayers for the order of the natural world.\n</div>\n<hr />\n\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable toggleable-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"x\" style=\"text-align: right;\">Source (Romanized Hebrew)</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Source (English)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<em>Hoshana Eloheinu Hoshana!<br />\nHoshana Bor’einu Hoshana!<br />\nHoshana Go’aleinu Hoshana!<br />\nHoshana Dorsheinu Hoshana! </em><br />\n</span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\">\nOur God, Please save!<br />\nOur Creator, Please save!<br />\nOur Redeemer, Please save!<br />\nOur Seeker, Please save!\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\">\n!הושענא<br />\n</span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\">\n<em>Hoshana!</em> Please save aquifers from poison and drought! <em>Hoshana!</em><br />\nSave bees from pesticides and fungus and collapse! <em>Hoshana!</em><br />\nSave bedrock from fracking and earthquakes! <em>Hoshana!</em><br />\nSave the breathing of this blue planet! <em>Hoshana!</em>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<em>Hoshana ananim mil’ham’ni’a otzroteihem!</em><br />\n</span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\">\nSave clouds from withholding their treasures! <em>Hoshana!</em>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<em>Hoshana Eretz u-m’lo’ah!<br />\nHoshana!<br />\nHoshana basar v’ruach u-n’shamah b’khol b’ri’ah!</em><br />\n</span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\">\nSave Earth and all that fills her! <em>Hoshana!</em><br />\nSave the forests from clearcutting, and from conflagration! <em>Hoshana!</em><br />\nSave flesh and spirit and soul in every being! <em>Hoshana!</em>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\">\nSave glistening rivers from becoming rivers of oil and blood! <em>Hoshana!</em><br />\nSave habitat and home and species! <em>Hoshana!</em>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\">\nPlease save!
