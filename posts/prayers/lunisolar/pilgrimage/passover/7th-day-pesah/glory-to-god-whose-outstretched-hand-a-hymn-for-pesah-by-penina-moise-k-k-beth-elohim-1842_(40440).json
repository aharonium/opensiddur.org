            "bio": "Ḳahal Ḳadosh Beth Elohim (Hebrew: קהל קדוש בית אלהים‎, also known as Ḳ.Ḳ. Beth Elohim, or more simply Congregation Beth Elohim), founded in 1749 in Charleston, South Carolina, is one of the oldest Jewish congregations in the United States. The founding members of the synagogue were Jews of Spanish and Portuguese descent (Sepharadim), who arrived into Charleston via London, England. Before 1830 Ḳahal Ḳadosh Beth Elohim was a place of worship for Spanish and Portuguese Jews using Portuguese rituals as done in Portugal before the Spanish and Portuguese inquisitions. A splinter group animated by the European Reform movement, the <a href=\"/profile/reformed-society-of-israelites/\">Reformed Society of Israelites</a>, formed in 1824. While at first this group did not succeed in reforming Beth Elohim, by the mid 1830s Beth Elohim had reabsorbed its members and its ḥazzan, Gustavus Poznanski (1804–1879), joined the Reform camp in 1840. After the first synagogue building was destroyed by fire in 1838, it was rebuilt two years afterward (in a Greek Revival style designed by Cyrus L. Warner) with an organ to the chagrin of the traditionalists. Ḳahal Ḳadosh Beth Elohim is recognized as the oldest Reform Jewish congregation in the Americas.",

            "bio": "Penina Moïse (1797-1880) was born to a large and wealthy family in Charleston, South Carolina, the progeny of her merchant father, Abraham Moïse (1736-1809), originally from Strasbourg in Alsace, France, and her mother Sarah from the Jewish community on the Caribbean island of Sint Eustatius in the Netherlands Antilles. Her brother, also named Abraham, was a leader in the <a href=\"/profile/reformed-society-of-israelites/\">Reformed Society of Israelites</a>, and so we imagine she was closely associated with the reformist wing of the congregation it wished to and ultimately succeeded in reforming, <a href=\"/profile/kahal-kadosh-beth-elohim/\">Ḳ.Ḳ. Beth Elohim</a>. Moïse wrote at least 187 prayers for Beth Elohim's hymn books published <a href=\"/?p=39305\">in 1842</a> and <a href=\"/?p=40488\">in 1856</a>. Moïse was also a gifted teacher and, in 1845, became head of Beth Elohim’s religious school. Moïse was a prolific writer, earning praise for her 1833 collection of poems, <em>Fancy’s Sketch Book</em>, as well as her articles for various newspapers across the country.  After the Civil War, she returned to Charleston and ran an academy with her sister and niece. Though her eyesight eventually deteriorated into blindness, she continued to work and write until the end of her life. (This short biographical sketch includes material adapted from <a href=\"https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/moise-penina\">her entry in the Jewish Women's Archive</a> by Jay M. Eidelman.)",
