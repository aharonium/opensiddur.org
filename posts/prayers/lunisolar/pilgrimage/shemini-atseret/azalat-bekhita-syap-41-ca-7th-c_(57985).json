It features multiple people, places, and things important in Moshe's life taking turns to eulogize him. It's been translated preserving the acrostic and monorhyme scheme.

    "content": "<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\" style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">\nIn the old Erets Yisrael rite, one aspect of the Simḥat Torah service was communal mourning for Moshe&#8217;s death, and multiple piyyutim in both Hebrew and Aramaic have been preserved as evidence of this custom. Considering the events of Simḥat Torah last year, perhaps it&#8217;s worth bringing that custom back. Presented here is the second of three Aramaic-language Byzantine-era lamentations for the death of Moshe (SYAP 40-42), written to be recited as part of the Simḥat Torah service. The second piyyut, Azalat Bekhita, is probably incomplete, extending only to ḥeth in known manuscripts. It features multiple people, places, and things important in Moshe&#8217;s life taking turns to eulogize him. It&#8217;s been translated preserving the acrostic and monorhyme scheme. Taken from Sokoloff and Yahalom&#8217;s <em>Jewish Palestinian Aramaic Poetry from Late Antiquity</em> (2018), it is presented here vocalized with an original translation.\n</div>\n<hr />\n\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable toggleable-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"x\" style=\"text-align: right;\">Source (Aramaic)</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Translation (English)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"jpa\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<span class=\"acrostic\">אֲ</span>זַלַת בְּכִיתָא בְּכׇל־מְדִינְתָּא<br />\nבְּשַׁעֲתָא דְּאִתְפַּטַר מֹשֶׁה נְבִיָּיא<br />\n<span class=\"acrostic\">בְּ</span>כָא יָתֵיהּ נִילוּס נַהֲרָא<br />\nגַּבְרָא דְּרַבִּיתִי מִן־טַלְיוּתָא\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<span class=\"acrostic\">A</span>ll the province went out weeping,<br />\nAt the hour that Moshe the prophet passed.<br />\n<span class=\"acrostic\">B</span>awling was the Nile River:<br />\n&#8220;The man I raised from youth!”\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"jpa\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<span class=\"acrostic\">גָּ</span>עַן וּבָכַן כׇּל־שִׁבְטַיָּא דְּיִשְׂרָאֵל<br />\nכְּעָנָא בְּמַדְבְּרָא דְּלֵית לְהוֹן רַעֲיָא<br />\n<span class=\"acrostic\">דִּ</span>מְעָא שָׁפְכִין בֵּית יִשְׂרָאֵל וְאָמְרִין<br />\nמָאן יְהַב לַנָא גַּבְרָא כְּוָותֵיהּ דְּמֹשֶׁה\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<span class=\"acrostic\">G</span>roaning and crying all the tribes of Israel,<br />\nlike a flock in the desert without a shepherd.<br />\n<span class=\"acrostic\">D</span>own flowed tears, as the House of Israel said:<br />\n&#8220;Who will give us a man akin to Moshe?”\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"jpa\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<span class=\"acrostic\">הַ</span>ר טוּרָא דְּתָבוֹר וכַרְמֶל שָׁפְכִין בְּבִכְיָיא<br />\nוְסִינַי מַסְפֵּד בֵּין־תַּרְוֵיהוֹן<br />\n<span class=\"acrostic\">וַ</span>וי עֲלַי אֲמַרַת אוֹרַייתָא<br />\nרַעֲיָא טָבָא דְּאִתְפְּרִיק מִינִּי\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<span class=\"acrostic\">H</span>igh mountains — Tabor and Carmel, poured out weeping,<br />\nAnd Sinai eulogized between them.<br />\n“<span class=\"acrostic\">W</span>oe is me!” said the Torah;<br />\n&#8220;A good shephard has been removed from me!”\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"jpa\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<span class=\"acrostic\">זַ</span>ע וְאִתְבְּהַל יְהוֹשֻׁעַ בִּן־נוּן<br />\nכְּיוֹנֵק דְּמִתְגְּמִיל מִדַּדֵי אִימֵּיהּ<br />\n<span class=\"acrostic\">חֲ</span>בַל עֲלַי אֲמַרַת אוֹרַייתָא<br />\nוּמֹשֶׁה יְהַב לִי חַיִּים לְעָלַם\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<span class=\"acrostic\">Z</span>one in on Yehoshua bin Nun, shaking and trembling,<br />\nlike an infant weaned from his mother’s breasts.<br />\n“<span class=\"acrostic\">H</span>umiliated am I,” said the Torah,<br />\n“as Moshe gave me life eternal!”\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
