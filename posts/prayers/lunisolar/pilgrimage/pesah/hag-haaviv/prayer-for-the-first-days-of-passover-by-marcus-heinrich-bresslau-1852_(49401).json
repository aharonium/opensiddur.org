            "bio": "Marcus Heinrich (also Mordecai Ḥayyim/Hyman/Heyman) Bresslau (ca. 1808-15 May 1864) was a Hebraist and newspaper editor. Born in Hamburg, he settled in England when young. For some time from 1834 he was Baal Ḳoreh (reader) at the Western Synagogue. He then taught Hebrew at the Westminster Jews’ Free School and went on to tutor privately. A maskil, he became involved with M. J. Raphall’s <em>Hebrew Review and Magazine of Rabbinical Literature</em> (1834-6). In October 1844 he was appointed editor of the relaunched <em>Jewish Chronicle</em> by proprietor Joseph Mitchell. Prickly and quarrelsome, he resigned in July 1848 but returned in around September. He remained until about October 1850. After Mitchell’s death in June 1854 he became proprietor (his middle name appearing as Heyman) and edited it until February 1855 when new proprietor Abraham Benisch succeeded him. Bresslau, who tried vainly to revive the <em>Hebrew Review</em>, wrote Hebrew poetry, produced a Hebrew grammar and a Hebrew dictionary, and translated various Hebrew manuscripts in the Bodleian Library. Bresslau compiled (we think) the first compilation of teḥinot in English for women. (Much of this information via Bresslau's entry in The Palgrave Dictionary of Anglo-Jewish History)",

Therefore, extol my soul, the high exalted Ruler of the World! Exalt Him for thy liberation from the yoke of Egyptian slavery, and strengthen thyself by confidence in Him; for, great and mighty, gracious and merciful, is our Heavenly Father, the God of Israel, who will restore us to perfect freedom in the days of <em>the promised Messiah</em>.
