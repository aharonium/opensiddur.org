b&#8217;Av vigil, co-sponsored by Tzedek Chicago, at the Jerome Combs immigrant detention center in Kankakee, Illinois, on 11 August 2019 . The text is an adaptation from the book of Lamentations (Eikhah), traditionally read on the festival of Tishah b&#8217;Av. It was first published on his blog on 3 June 2021 in a post, &#8220;<a href=\"https://rabbibrant.com/2021/06/03/judaism-beyond-zionism-toward-a-new-jewish-liturgy/\">Judaism Beyond Zionism: Toward a New Jewish Liturgy</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
