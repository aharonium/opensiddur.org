Compassion for animals is declared to have been the merit of Moshe which made him the <em>shepherd</em> of his people (<em>Exodus Rabbah</em> 2), while Yehudah ha-Nasi saw in his own ailment the punishment for having once failed to show compassion for a frightened calf (<em>Bava Metzia</em> 85a). The <em>aggadic</em> (mythic) tradition concerned with the origin of predatory nature in <em>Olam Hazeh</em> (this world) can be found in the Jewish deutero-canonical works of <em>Sefer Ḥanokh</em> (1 Enoch) and <em>Sefer haYovelim</em> (Jubilees) as well as in<em> Midrash Abkir</em> and the collection of rabbinic midrash and midrash aggadah, <em>Yalkut Shimoni</em>.</p>\n<p>In Sefer haYovelim (a/k/a Jubilees, circa 3rd century BCE), the need for circumscribing the predatory nature of humankind after the <em>Dor Hamabul</em> (depraved generation of the Flood) is given as the <em>raison d&#8217;etre</em> for the giving of the Torah. As required by the covenant of the Rainbow made to Noaḥ and his descendants after the flood, a representative people was needed who might abide by the general commandment of <em>ever min haḥai</em> (forbidding eating living creatures). In this tradition, Avraham was the first to prove worthy since his actions epitomized <em>ḥesed</em>, lovingkindness (an innovation in Judaism&#8217;s mytho-historic chronicle of humanity in Genesis). As noted in Rav Shlomo Kluger&#8217;s HaElef L’cha Shlomo in Yoreh Deah 322, dairy foods, the product of living creatures, were prohibited after the Flood, but this prohibition was relaxed upon the giving of the Torah at Sinai just as the prohibition against eating flesh was relaxed after the covenant at Ararat. For this reason, dairy is a symbolic food eaten on the festival of Shavuot (Pentecost) and remains a symbolic food representing the subversion of predatory nature as reflected in <a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/prayers-for/special-days/commemorative-days/hanukkah/megillat-yehudit-for-hanukkah/\">Megilat Yehudith</a> and the dairy food traditions of the festival of Ḥanukkah.
