With <em>smikhah</em> (ordination) from the Jewish Theological Seminary and from <a href=\"/profile/zalman-schachter-shalomi/\">Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi</a>, he has taught at over 100 synagogues, communities, retreats and conferences across North America (and a few in Europe and Israel). Rabbi Seidenberg's teaching empowers learners to become creators of Judaism through deep study and communion with texts and tradition. Areas of specialty include Kabbalah and Ḥasidut, Talmud, davenning, evolution and cosmology, sustainability, Maimonides, Buber, and more. Rabbi Seidenberg has <a href=\"http://neohasid.org/about/pub\">published widely</a> on ecology and Judaism and is the author of <em>Kabbalah and Ecology: God's Image in the More-Than-Human World</em> (Cambridge University Press, 2015).",
