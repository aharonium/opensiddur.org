The text of the prayer here is that which was distributed by Rabbi Captain Udi Schwartz, head of the chief rabbi for Tsahal (IDF), and published by <a href=\"https://www.inn.co.il/news/356338\">Arutz 7</a>. The kavvanah is derived from one published in 1983 by Rav Yitschok Zilberstein for those who, due to their state of health, must eat or drink in order to live (find <a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/?p=46976\"><em>Toras haYoledes</a></em> (1983), chapter 52, section 10, p. 357; pp. 331-332 in the bilingual edition 1989).
