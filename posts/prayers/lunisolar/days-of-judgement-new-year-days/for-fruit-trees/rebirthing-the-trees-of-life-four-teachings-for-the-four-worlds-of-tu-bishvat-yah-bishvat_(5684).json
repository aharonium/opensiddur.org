Trees give us nuts &amp; fruit in such profusion that we can eat and eat without endangering the next generation. Even the Pesaḥ bitter herb requires yanking a radish up by the root.

Above us towered trees that were more than 200 feet tall — the tallest living beings on the planet. Suddenly my friend, student, co-editor, and teacher (now Rabbi) Naomi Mara Hyman turned to me and said, &#8220;Imagine if those 200-foot-tall <em>eytzim</em> (trees) were the eytzim (wooden poles) of a Sefer Torah! — What a Sefer Torah it would be, how large, not only physically but in the spirit!
