            "name": "Emma Goldman",
            "bio": "Emma Goldman (Yiddish: עממא גאלדמאן, June 27 [O.S. June 15], 1869 – May 14, 1940) was an anarchist political activist and writer. She played a pivotal role in the development of anarchist political philosophy in North America and Europe in the first half of the 20th century. Born in Kovno, Russian Empire (now Kaunas, Lithuania) to a Jewish family, Goldman emigrated to the United States in 1885. Attracted to anarchism after the Haymarket affair, Goldman became a writer and a renowned lecturer on anarchist philosophy, women's rights, and social issues, attracting crowds of thousands. She and anarchist writer Alexander Berkman, her lover and lifelong friend, planned to assassinate industrialist and financier Henry Clay Frick as an act of propaganda of the deed. Frick survived the attempt on his life in 1892, and Berkman was sentenced to 22 years in prison. Goldman was imprisoned several times in the years that followed, for \"inciting to riot\" and illegally distributing information about birth control. In 1906, Goldman founded the anarchist journal Mother Earth. In 1917, Goldman and Berkman were sentenced to two years in jail for conspiring to \"induce persons not to register\" for the newly instated draft. After their release from prison, they were arrested—along with 248 others—and deported to Russia. Initially supportive of that country's October Revolution that brought the Bolsheviks to power, Goldman changed her opinion in the wake of the Kronstadt rebellion; she denounced the Soviet Union for its violent repression of independent voices. She left the Soviet Union and in 1923 published a book about her experiences, My Disillusionment in Russia. While living in England, Canada, and France, she wrote an autobiography called Living My Life. It was published in two volumes, in 1931 and 1935. After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, Goldman traveled to Spain to support the anarchist revolution there. She died in Toronto, Canada, on May 14, 1940, aged 70. During her life, Goldman was lionized as a freethinking \"rebel woman\" by admirers, and denounced by detractors as an advocate of politically motivated murder and violent revolution. Her writing and lectures spanned a wide variety of issues, including prisons, atheism, freedom of speech, militarism, capitalism, marriage, free love, and homosexuality. Although she distanced herself from first-wave feminism and its efforts toward women's suffrage, she developed new ways of incorporating gender politics into anarchism. After decades of obscurity, Goldman gained iconic status in the 1970s by a revival of interest in her life, when feminist and anarchist scholars rekindled popular interest.

    "excerpt": "A teachable moment in the life of Emma Goldman to reflect upon whether our practice is liberating or in need of liberation. . . .",
    "content": "<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\" style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">\nI do believe that periodically, it is worthwhile to reflect on whether one&#8217;s religious practice is nurturing one&#8217;s creativity, curiosity, and compassion or yet another grim prison through which our perception of the Cosmos and our fellow inhabitants is terminally circumscribed, or worse: a worldview and ethos sanctioning for us the willful harm, oppression, and even predation of other beings. Adapting the phrase commonly attributed to Emma Goldman (see below), I try to remind myself: &#8220;If I can&#8217;t trip to it, it&#8217;s not my religion!&#8221; (and, If you&#8217;re causing harm to others through your praxis, then you&#8217;re most certainly &#8220;doing it wrong.&#8221;)</p>\n<p>This reflection is, it seems to me, well suited for the period of reflection during the Sefirat ha-Omer, as we are now in the Midbar, and well on our way to who-knows-what (a theophany!) and it was in the Midbar that Mosheh had insistingly requested of Pharaoh that we depart to experience, through freedom, a divine Nature otherwise hidden behind the constraints, conventions, and familiar expectations of servitude. Are we free yet? How will we know? And what constraints must we accede to willingly to best appreciate this freedom, together, and safely so. </p>\n<p>Note: I have added emphasis to Emma Goldman&#8217;s references to &#8220;<span class=\"divine-referent\">the cause</span>&#8221; after the convention of Isaac Gantwerk Mayer to substitute &#8220;<span class=\"divine-referent\">the cause</span>&#8221; as a circumlocution for <span class=\"divine-referent\">the tetragrammaton</span>,<span class=\"footnote_referrer\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_1');\" onkeypress=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_1');\" ><sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_1\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\">[1]</sup></a><span id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_1\" class=\"footnote_tooltip\"> The note on the idiosyncratic circumlocution reads as follows: “<span class=\"divine-referent\">The CAUSE</span>” is used to translate the Divine Name <span class=\"divine-referent\">YHVH</span>, based on the philosophical idea of <span class=\"divine-referent\">God</span> as the <span class=\"divine-referent\">Prime Mover</span> and on the interpretation of <span class=\"divine-referent\">the Name</span> as a causative form of the copula – “causes to be.”&nbsp;</span></span><script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery('#footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_1').tooltip({ tip: '#footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_1', tipClass: 'footnote_tooltip', effect: 'fade', predelay: 0, fadeInSpeed: 200, delay: 400, fadeOutSpeed: 200, position: 'center right', relative: true, offset: [0, 0], });</script> and after the Open Siddur Project&#8217;s <a href=\"/style-guide/\">style guide</a> suggestion to style divine names and epithets in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicase\">unicase</a>. This is not to misrepresent Goldman&#8217;s dedication to anarchism as something else. Rather, I do this suggestively to highlight what seems to me to be two inescapable truths: 1) that the experience of divinity (or its proxy: divine authority) will reassert itself under a new name and guise, in any place people imagine that the delusion of divinity has been undone or abandoned, and 2) that experiencing &#8220;beautiful, radiant things&#8221; is a consequence of embracing the freedom of our lives with kind consideration of each other&#8217;s mutual needs in &#8220;the midbar&#8221; &#8212; the wilderness, in the myriad ways we encounter its mysteries.\n</div>\n<hr />\n\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable toggleable-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"x\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"/translate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contribute&nbsp;a&nbsp;translation</a></th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Source (English)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nAt the dances I was one of the most untiring and gayest.<br />\nOne evening a cousin of Sasha, a young boy, took me aside.<br />\nWith a grave face,<br />\nas if he were about to announce the death of a dear comrade,<br />\nhe whispered to me that it did not behoove an agitator to dance.<br />\nCertainly not with such reckless abandon, anyway.<br />\nIt was undignified<br />\nfor one who was<br />\non the way<br />\nto become a force<br />\nin the anarchist movement.<br />\nMy frivolity would only hurt <span class=\"divine-referent\">the Cause</a>.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nI grew furious at the impudent interference of the boy.<br />\nI told him to mind his own business.<br />\nI was tired of having <span class=\"divine-referent\">the Cause</span> constantly thrown into my face.<br />\nI did not believe that a <span class=\"divine-referent\">Cause</span> which stood for a beautiful ideal,<br />\nfor anarchism, for release and freedom from convention and prejudice,<br />\nshould demand the denial of life and joy.<br />\nI insisted that <span class=\"divine-referent\">our Cause</span> could not expect me to become a nun<br />\nand that the movement would not be turned into a cloister.<br />\nIf it meant that, I did not want it.<br />\n&#8220;I want freedom, the right to self-expression,<br />\neverybody&#8217;s right to beautiful, radiant things.&#8221;<br />\nAnarchism meant that to me,<br />\nand I would live it in spite of the whole world —<br />\nprisons, persecution, everything.<br />\nYes, even in spite of the condemnation<br />\nof my own closest comrades<br />\nI would live my beautiful ideal.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<p>As excerpted from Emma Goldman&#8217;s autobiography, <em>Living My Life, vol.
