Levy of Philadelphia, Pa. For thirty-five years he was president of the principal bank of New Orleans, Louisiana. He was postmaster of that city, and was chosen by its citizens to receive Gen. Zachary Taylor on his return from the battle of Buena Vista in 1847. He was granted a large tract of land in Florida for services rendered in the Indian War. Columbus Moïse wrote many short poems, one of which was sung at the laying of the cornerstone during the consecration of the new synagogue building for Ḳ.Ḳ. Beth Elohim in Charleston, South Carolina.",

Beth Elohim</a>, Charleston, South Carolina, who gathered in late 1824 to petition the congregation to modify the service of prayers with an adapted liturgy emphasizing English translations, original hymns, and other modifications. Among other reforms, the group called for shorter services and sermons conducted in English that would relate the weekly parashah to everyday life. Prominent leaders in the group were Isaac Harby (1788–1828), <a href=\"/profile/abraham-moise/\">Abraham Moïse</a> (1799-1869), and <a href=\"/profile/david-nunes-carvalho/\">David Nunes Carvalho</a> (1784-1860). After Harby's death in 1828, the group published a prayerbook (later reprinted by <a href=\"/profile/barnett-abraham-elzas/\">Barnett Elzas</a>/Bloch in 1916). In 1833, the group dissolved but in rejoining Beth Elohim they also managed to succeed in their original mission in putting the congregation on a firm Reform movement trajectory.",
