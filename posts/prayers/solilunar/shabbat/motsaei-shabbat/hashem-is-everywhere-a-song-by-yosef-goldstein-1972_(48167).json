    "excerpt": "The pedagogical song \"Hashem is Everywhere!\" by Rabbi Yosef Goldstein (1928-2013) can be found in the context of his story, \"Where is Hashem?,\" the second track on his album מדות טובות <em>Jewish Ethics Through Story and Song</em> (Menorah Records 1972). In the instructions to reciting the lyrics, the singer points first to the six cardinal directions and lastly, by pointing inward towards one's self. In so doing, one explicitly affirms the idea of the divine within ourselves and implicitly, <em>in each other</em>. . . .",

In the instructions for the song, pointing is an essential part of its performance. I had forgotten this! In searching for the original recording of the song and its accompanying story I not only rediscovered (for myself) these instructions, but also learned that along with the six directions, it was integral to recognize a seventh direction by pointing inward towards one&#8217;s self. In so doing, one explicitly affirms the idea of the divine within ourselves and implicitly, <em>in each other</em>.</p>\n<p>I have here transcribed Rabbi Yosef Goldstein&#8217;s introduction to the story, &#8220;Where is Hashem?&#8221; framing the song &#8220;Hashem is Everywhere!&#8221;<span class=\"footnote_referrer\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_2');\" onkeypress=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_2');\" ><sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_2\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\">[2]</sup></a><span id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_2\" class=\"footnote_tooltip\"> This seems to be the informal, popular title for the song, as given on the liner notes of the second album in the series (מדות טובות <em>Jewish Ethics Through Story and Song vol. 1, no. 2</em>, Menorah Records 1972).

Eckhart, on the other hand, embraces the identification, calling the spark, among other endearing names, <em>das Kleidhaus Gottes</em>, ‘the house in which God attires Himself ’.

Raphael Loewe (Humanities: 1966) 87-114.) For those more familiar with Quaker theology than Ḥassidut, they might recall a similar belief shared by George Fox (1624-1691). Elsewhere, one can find the idea of the <em>pintele yid</em> associated (or conflated) with the idea of the <em>tselem Elohim</em> of Genesis 1:26-27 rather than the animating breath of Genesis 2:7.&nbsp;</span></span><script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery('#footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_4').tooltip({ tip: '#footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_4', tipClass: 'footnote_tooltip', effect: 'fade', predelay: 0, fadeInSpeed: 200, delay: 400, fadeOutSpeed: 200, position: 'center right', relative: true, offset: [0, 0], });</script></span>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"yiddish\" lang=\"yid-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\nה׳ איז דא<br />\nה׳ איז דארט<br />\nה׳ איז באמת אומעטום\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nHashem is here<br />\nHashem is there<br />\nHashem is truly everywhere <span class=\"instruction\">(×2)</span>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"yiddish\" lang=\"yid-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\nאױבּן אױבּן<br />\nאונטן אונטן<br />\nרעכט לינקס<br />\nאון אין אַלע ערטער<br />\nדאָ, דאָרט און אומעטום<br />\nס׳איז װוּ מ׳קען ה׳ געפינען.\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nUp up<br />\nDown down<br />\nRight left<br />\nAnd all around<br />\nHere, there, and everywhere<br />\nThat&#8217;s where he can be found. <span class=\"instruction\">(×2)</span>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<p>The pedagogical song &#8220;Hashem is Everywhere!&#8221; by Rabbi Yosef Goldstein (1928-2013) can be found in the context of his story, &#8220;Where is Hashem?,&#8221; the second track on his album מדות טובות <em>Jewish Ethics Through Story and Song</em> (Menorah Records 1972).

Many thanks to Baruch Thaler for his improvements!</p>\n<p>We have not yet been able to determine whether the song was originally published along with the album, or whether the notes to the album were, themselves, registered with the Copyright Office. No copyright notice appears on the album cover, a requirement for materials receiving copyright at the time of its publication. Since the copyright status of this work is ambiguous at best, we are invoking the rarely used Fair Use declaration under which this sort of content may still be shared, <em>dina malkhuta dina</em>, in the United States, for non-commercial, scholarly, and educational purposes only. However, we should stress, this work may indeed already be in the Public Domain due to the lack of a copyright notice on the album cover on which the work was published.</p>\n<p>One last point. While we don&#8217;t know (yet) how long this song existed before it was recorded, I believe that the phrase &#8220;here, there, and everywhere&#8221; helps to date it to after the Beatles&#8217;s album <em>Revolver</em> (1966), as the fifth track, &#8220;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here,_There_and_Everywhere\">Here, There, and Everywhere</a>,&#8221; by Paul McCartney became very well established. It would be lovely to learn whether the line &#8220;Here, there, and everywhere&#8221; in &#8220;Hashem is Everywhere!&#8221; was inspired by (or composed in response to) any work by the Beatles. For a song whose explicit theme is directly related, find George Harrison&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsffxGyY4ck\">Within You Without You</a>&#8221; from <em>Sgt.
