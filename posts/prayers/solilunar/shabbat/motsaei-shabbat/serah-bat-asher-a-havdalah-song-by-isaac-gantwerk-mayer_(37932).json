But Miriam isn't really a parallel to Elijah — she's a parallel to Moshe and Aaron. When we're talking about distaff counterparts to Elijah the clearest example is Seraḥ bat Asher. Seraḥ, the daughter of Asher, is mentioned only a handful of times in the Tanakh, but is given great significance in the midrash. Like Elijah, she is said to have never died but entered Paradise alive, and comes around to the rabbis to give advice or teachings. This song, which includes several references to midrashim about Seraḥ, is meant to be sung to any traditional tune of \"Eliyahu haNavi.\" It is dedicated to Ḥazzan Joanna Selznick Dulkin (shlit\"a), who introduced me to the legends of Seraḥ bat Asher. . . .",
