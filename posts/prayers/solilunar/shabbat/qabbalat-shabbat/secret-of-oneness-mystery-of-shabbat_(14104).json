This happens during the Ma’ariv prayers of Shabbat, for then She, the Throne of <em>Kavod</em>, is unified through the secret of Oneness, and becomes ready for the Highest Holy One to descend upon Her. When Shabbat comes, She enters into union and sheds the side of otherness, the <em>sitra-aḥra</em> &#8212; the forces of negativity. All judgement and harshness pass from Her, and She remains in union with the Holy Radiance. She crowns Herself with many crowns as she faces the Holy King. All the forces of anger and grievance flee, and there is no power but She in all the worlds. Her face glows with a heavenly light, and She is crowned from below by the holy people who themselves are enwrapped and crowned with new supernal souls (that come with Shabbat).

It is the source in the secret of the sign of the covenant, which we call ‘<em>hamVorakh</em>,’ for it is the fountain of the well. When [the blessings] reach there, the well certainly becomes filled, for the water never stops flowing.

The translations here were adapted from Rabbi Marcia Prager&#8217;s Pnai Or siddur (Terumah §163-166), and from Michael Berg&#8217;s translation of the Zohar (Terumah §169-170).</p>\n<p>In the terminology of the Zohar, the sphere called Malkhut (Majesty/Kingship) refers to our world, indeed, our reality. In a midrash aggadah, the Primordial Adam was shown all the souls that would descend through them and after perceiving one particularly radiant soul that otherwise might not have lived, asked for seventy years of his life to be gifted to the soul so that it might be embodied in our world. As with King David, so to the nature of Malkhut whose existence is entirely dependent on a gift of lovingkindness from the Most High, the king of kings, the Blessed Holy One. These passages from the Zohar Terumah explicates the relationship by which Malkhut, gendered female, is prepared as the immanent divine presence — the Shabbat Queen and Shekhina — for unification with the transcendent Blessed Holy One. In the realm of kabbalistic symbolic associations, the Shekhina here is synonymous in many ways with the Jewish people. United in the castle in time, as A.J. Heschel refers to it, the people prepare for and enact this wedding with Blessed Holy One in a choreography realized through prayer and joy. The yiḥud (unification) of Shekhina (immanent perception of the divinity suffusing all of reality) with <span class=\"divine-referent\">the blessed Holy One</span> (the transcendent divine approached through imaginative and intellectual feats) is an everpresent goal in kabbalistic Judaism. — Aharon Varady</p>\n<h3>Source</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_14109\" style=\"width: 223px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kgavneh-small.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-14109\" src=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kgavneh-small-213x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"213\" height=\"300\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-14109\" srcset=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kgavneh-small-213x300.png 213w, https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kgavneh-small.png 728w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 213px) 100vw, 213px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-14109\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">K&#8217;Gavna &#8211; &#8220;The Secret of Shabbat&#8221; from the P&#8217;nai Or Erev Shabbat Siddur, p. 15.</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
