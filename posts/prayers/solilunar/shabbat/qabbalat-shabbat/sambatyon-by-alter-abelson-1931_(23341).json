In 1903 he received his Master of Hebrew Literature from the Jewish Theological Seminary and in 1920 received a law degree from the New Jersey Law School (now Rutgers). Abelson, who served as a rabbi in synagogues in New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island, also served as a chaplain for the New York Board of Rabbis from 1947 to his retirement in 1960. Abelson authored four poetry collections, <em>Helen and Shulamith</em> (Whittier Books, 1959), <em>Songs of Labor</em> (Paebar Co. Publishers, 1947), <em>Sonnets of Motherhood</em> (1938), and <em>Sambatyon and Other Poems</em> (The Ariel Publications, 1931), and translated work by the Hebrew poets Judah Halevi and Chaim Nachman Bialik. He died in 1964.",
