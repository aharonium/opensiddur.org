It&#8217;s almost impossible to miss in most Nusaḥ Ari z&#8221;l and sepharadi siddurim, being placed right in the middle of the morning prayers and followed by a pretty good helping of suggested study material such as <em>mishnayot</em>, Zohar, or other kabbalistic tracts.</p>\n<p>The popular practice of a night time prayer vigil is not well understood. In the siddur, most people pass by it because they don&#8217;t know what to do with it. Others are confused because of the lack of consistency in its presentation from one siddur to the next. At the end of the day, this ritual would be regarded as a rite reserved for the pious &#8212; for the great <em>tzadikim</em> who made regular use of it.</p>\n<p>Though there is much variance in the way this ritual became practiced among different Jewish communities, it became more popular over time. Lifestyles changed as Jews moved from the countryside into cities, and the regular sun-up to sun-down routine became less fixed. Based on biblical example the rabbis took up prayer at night. They cited the following verse in <em>Eikha</em> on rising up at the hours of the change of the guards:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"46%\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\nק֣וּמִי׀ רֹ֣נִּי <font color=\"brown\">בליל</font> <font color=\"blue\">בַלַּ֗יְלָה</font> לְרֹאשׁ֙ אַשְׁמֻר֔וֹת שִׁפְכִ֤י כַמַּ֙יִם֙ לִבֵּ֔ךְ נֹ֖כַח פְּנֵ֣י אֲדֹנָ֑י שְׂאִ֧י אֵלָ֣יו כַּפַּ֗יִךְ עַל־נֶ֙פֶשׁ֙ עֽוֹלָלַ֔יִךְ הָעֲטוּפִ֥ים בְּרָעָ֖ב בְּרֹ֥אשׁ כָּל־חוּצֽוֹת׃<br />\n</span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nArise, cry out in the night,<br />\nAt the beginning of the watches;<br />\nPour out thy heart like water<br />\nBefore the face of the Lord;<br />\n(Lamentations 2:19)<span class=\"footnote_referrer\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_1');\" onkeypress=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_1');\" ><sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_1\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\">[1]</sup></a><span id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_1\" class=\"footnote_tooltip\"> The verse continues, &#8220;Lift up thy hands toward Him<br />\nFor the life of thy young children,<br />\nThat faint for hunger<br />\nAt the head of every street.’&#8221;<br />\nFrom <em>The Holy Scriptures According to the Masoretic Text</em> Lamentations 2:19.

Because Raḥel was known as a biblical example of suffering and heartache (see Jeremiah 31:14-16), the <em>Tikkun Raḥel</em> was sanctified as a time for people to let out their inner most sufferings and cry out to G-d.</p>\n<p>They also cited the words of <em>Tehillim</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"46%\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n‏חֲצֽוֹת־לַ֗יְלָה אָ֭קוּם לְהוֹד֣וֹת לָ֑ךְ עַ֝֗ל מִשְׁפְּטֵ֥י צִדְקֶֽךָ׃<br />\n</span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nAt midnight I will rise up to give thanks to You, for your righteous judgment. (Psalms 119:62)\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This would be the basis of formulating the second part, <em>Tikkun Leah</em>, named after the other matriarch of Israel and wife of Jacob. This section would be comprised of prayers and songs of praise for salvation, to raise one out of despair after pouring out their heart.  It was understood by the Rabbis that when Israel went into exile the Presence of G-d also descended into exile with us. This was understood as a moment for one&#8217;s soul to attempt to cleave to G-d. One would reflect and take comfort in G-d being close to us and our trouble; thanking Him joyfully because He is always faithful to save.</p>\n<p>Likewise following their understanding of Psalms 134:1&#8217;s reference to “standing in the house of G-d at night” as meaning standing at the <em>bimah</em> learning, they deemed it was appropriate for one to study the Torah at night. Thus was added the custom of studying <em>mishanyot</em>, Zohar, or other mystical works at the end of this prayer vigil.</p>\n<p>The rabbis thereby found a justification for nighttime prayer and study. They thus formulated from our tradition a very stirring custom of personal devotion. Because this often meant people interrupting their sleep in order to fulfill this <em>tikkun</em> it was placed after the blessings one says when they awake, where it now is placed in most all Nusaḥ Ari z&#8221;l siddurim and comprehensive prayerbooks of the other traditions.</p>\n<p><strong>History</strong></p>\n<p>At the very beginning of his <em>Shulḥan Arukh</em> (Code of Jewish Law), <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Karo\">Rav Yosef Caro</a> (1488-1575) states the following <em>halakhic</em> code:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"46%\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\nא. כארי לעמוד בבוקר לעבודת בוראו, שיהא הוא מעורר השחר.<br />\nב. המשכים להתחנן לפני בוראו &#8211; יכוין לשעות שמשתנות המשמרות, שהן: בשליש הלילה, ולסוף שני שלישי הלילה, ולסוף הלילה, שהתפילה שיתפלל באותם השעות על החורבן ועל הגלות רצויה.<br />\nג. ראוי לכל ירא שמים שיהא מיצר ודואג על חורבן בית המקדש.<br />\n</span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<p>1. One should strengthen himself like a lion to get up in the morning to serve his creator. He should get up early enough to welcome in the dawn.<br />\n2. One who wishes to get up early and pray before his creator should try to do so at the times where the angels change shifts. <strong>This occurs after one third of the night</strong>, after two thirds and after the night is over.<br />\n3. The prayer that one prays at those times should be concerning the destruction of the <em>Beit Hamikdash</em> (Holy Temple) and on the exile. <span class=\"footnote_referrer\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_2');\" onkeypress=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_2');\" ><sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_2\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\">[2]</sup></a><span id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_2\" class=\"footnote_tooltip\"> From “<a href=\"http://www.shulchanarach.com/morning_preparation.htm\">Shulchan Arach: Halachos of a person&#8217;s morning preparations: Chapter 1 &#8211; Laws of awakening in the morning.</a>.” Translation by Jay Dinovitser.

This practice, as most of the liturgy that was adopted by the mystical schools of Eretz Yisrael, was based on a Sepharadi liturgy. It would be comprised of several prayers, confessions, Psalms, Lamentations and other scriptural passages relating to the <em>churva</em> – the destruction that led to exile. Over time various communities and schools of thought added liturgical dirges (<em>kinot</em>) and meditations to it that were written by kabbalist rabbis.</p>\n<p>In the Ashkenazi tradition many <em>kinot</em> were added to the readings and would eventually make up the majority of the <em>Tikkun Ḥatzot</em> in some cases. The Sefaradim, however only added <em>yichudim</em> (literally, unifications) spiritual meditations for arousing the presence of the Shechina – the Presence of G-d &#8212; to help bring about a <em>tikkun olam</em>, healing of the world.</p>\n<p>The Ari z&#8221;l adopted the Sepharadic liturgy when he settled in Eretz Yisrael, bringing these yichudim into his nusaḥ. When the hassidic movement coalesced in the early 18th century, it followed the example of the Ari z&#8221;l, and the <em>Tikkun Ḥatzot</em> was absorbed into their siddurim. As the Nusah Ari z&#8221;l predated the authorship of the <em>kinot</em>, hassidic siddurim did not contain them. In later years other ḥassidim would adopt <em>kinot</em> and <em>yichud</em>. Rebbe Naḥman of Breslov would also use <em>Ḥatzot</em> as an opportunity for practicing <em>hitbodedut</em> &#8211; heartfelt personal prayer and meditation.<span class=\"footnote_referrer\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_3');\" onkeypress=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_3');\" ><sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_3\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\">[3]</sup></a><span id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_3\" class=\"footnote_tooltip\"> [<em>hitbodedut</em> &#8212; from the root בדד <em>boded</em>, to isolate oneself, opening one&#8217;s heart in sincere verbal discourse with the blessed Holy One. &#8211;Aharon Varady]&nbsp;</span></span><script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery('#footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_3').tooltip({ tip: '#footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_3', tipClass: 'footnote_tooltip', effect: 'fade', predelay: 0, fadeInSpeed: 200, delay: 400, fadeOutSpeed: 200, position: 'center right', relative: true, offset: [0, 0], });</script>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When the <em>Baal HaTanya</em> [Rav Shneur Zalman of Lyadi] formulated his siddur, his general approach was to make the text usable for people of all traditions. One of the ways of harmonizing was to not add the various lengthy liturgical songs and poems that were different from place to place. He focused more on the actual prayers and the scriptures; what was necessary for the common man. Likewise he also dropped the <em>Yichud</em> from his siddur in almost all cases, as being non-essential.</p>\n<p>In the <em><a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/development/open-siddur/siddur-torah-ohr-according-to-the-text-of-r-schneur-zalman-of-liadi/\">Siddur Torah Ohr</a></em> of the <em>Baal HaTanya</em> (the ḤaBaD siddur that predated the now more widely used <em>Siddur Tehillat Hashem</em>) the <em>Tikkun Ḥatzot</em> was placed at the end with many various prayers and rituals that were paired with study material. As previously stated, the <em>Baal HaTanya </em> edited his text based on logical variances he applied broadly to his siddur, his selections follow the same framework here. The only variance aside from that is that he did not include the confessions (<em>Tavo L&#8217;fanecha</em> and <em>Ashamnu</em>) as he saw it being of such importance that he included it in the Bedtime Shema said before one goes to bed so that one would not miss out on it if the nights were short and would not be able to wake up for <em>Tikkun Ḥatzot</em>. This ritual would never become commanded, it would always stand as an optional form of devotion; though the <em>Baal HaTanya</em> would encourage people to attempt to say<em>Tikkun Ḥatzot</em> at least once a week, preferably on Thursday night (prior to <em>Erev Shabbat</em>).<span class=\"footnote_referrer\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_4');\" onkeypress=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_4');\" ><sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_4\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\">[4]</sup></a><span id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_4\" class=\"footnote_tooltip\"> “In our bereaved generation, however, when not all are capable of turning their hearts instantly from one extreme [to the other, from humility to joy], it is advised that <em>teshuvah tata&#8217;ah</em> be practiced earlier, at <em>Tikkun Ḥatzot</em>.
