In the United States, her poetry appeared in Isaac Leeser's <a href=\"http://web.nli.org.il/sites/JPress/English/Pages/The-Occident-and-American-Jewish-Advocate.aspx\"><em>Occident</em> and <em>American Jewish Advocate</em></a>. The daughter of Simeon Kensington Salaman (b.1789) and Alice Cowan, Rosa Emma was one of fourteen siblings in a large and literary Jewish family in London, part of the Spanish and Portuguese Jewish community. Two sisters, Kate Salaman and Julia Goodman, were painters -- the former of miniatures and the latter, a prolific portraitist. Her brother, Charles Kensington Salaman, was a British composer and pianist. Her husband, Judah Julius Collins, was a warden of the Western Marble Arch Synagogue in London's West End, and purported to be a descendant of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal_Shem_of_London\">Baal Shem of London</a>. Their son, Edwin Collins, was a Jewish educator.",
