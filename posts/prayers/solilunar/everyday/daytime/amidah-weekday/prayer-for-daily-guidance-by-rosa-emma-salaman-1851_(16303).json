In the United States, her poetry appeared in Isaac Leeser's <a href=\"http://web.nli.org.il/sites/JPress/English/Pages/The-Occident-and-American-Jewish-Advocate.aspx\"><em>Occident</em> and <em>American Jewish Advocate</em></a>. The daughter of Simeon Kensington Salaman (b.1789) and Alice Cowan, Rosa Emma was one of fourteen siblings in a large and literary Jewish family in London, part of the Spanish and Portuguese Jewish community. Two sisters, Kate Salaman and Julia Goodman, were painters -- the former of miniatures and the latter, a prolific portraitist. Her brother, Charles Kensington Salaman, was a British composer and pianist. Her husband, Judah Julius Collins, was a warden of the Western Marble Arch Synagogue in London's West End, and purported to be a descendant of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal_Shem_of_London\">Baal Shem of London</a>. Their son, Edwin Collins, was a Jewish educator.",

Introducing the prayer, Isaac Leeser wrote:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In our last volume, we gave two short prayers by our esteemed friend, Rosa, whose productions we hope to present yet more frequently in our pages. Since then we have received the subjoined, which, we doubt not, will interest our readers as much as it has done us. We still en­tertain the opinion, expressed in our article, vol. ix., pp. 253-5, that we Israelites need devotional exercises in addition to the contents of the prayer-book adapted to the wants of the lonely heart, especially of the female when she is watching, perchance, by the bedside of a dearly beloved object stricken down by the hand of sickness, or when she is surrounded in the busy world by those who feel not with her, and heed not the breathings of faith which animate her innermost spirit. It is therefore that we shall welcome any contributions to our literature which shall fill this void, even in a small degree, and we shall deem him worthy of being called a benefactor of our people, who shall succeed in indicting petitions which shall, as occasional exercises, be able to be placed alongside of those ennobling prayers composed by our ancients, though we confess that we despair of ever seeing this idea realized in its fullest extent.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Source</h3>\n<p>[gview file=&#8221;https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Prayer-for-Daily-Guidance-by-Rosa-Emma-Salaman-from-The-Occident-May-1852.pdf&#8221;]</p>\n",
