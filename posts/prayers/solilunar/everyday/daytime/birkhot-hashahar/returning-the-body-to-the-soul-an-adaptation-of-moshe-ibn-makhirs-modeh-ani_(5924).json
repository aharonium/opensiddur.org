    "content": "<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\" style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">\nI have difficulty with the idea of thanking God for &#8220;returning my soul to me&#8221; <em>sheheḥezarta bi nishmati</em> when I’m getting up with an awareness of trying to stay in touch with my dreams. It’s not my soul that’s been missing through the night; I’m returning to experience my body. So I much prefer what I heard someone suggest, that instead of saying <em>nishmati</em> (my soul), to say instead <em>ha-</em>[hitgalmut shel] <em>nishmati</em> (the embodiment of my soul). I thank God for returning me to my body &#8212; my soul was never missing! In the words of my Sufi teacher Murat Yagan, “I am a soul, and I have a body.&#8221; &#8211;Ya&#8217;qub ibn Yusuf\n</div>\n<hr />\n[expander_maker id=\"1\" more=\"TABLE HELP\" less=\"close\"]\r\n<p />\r\n<u style=\"text-underline-offset: 5px;\">TOGGLE COLUMNS (on/off)</u>: <div id=\"column-toggle-container\"></div>\r\n<p />ADJUST COLUMN POSITIONS: select the column header cell and drag it where you want. <strong><a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/images/column-drag6.gif\" rel=\"lightbox\">show me!</a></strong>\r\n<p />COPY INDIVIDUAL COLUMN(S): use <a href=\"https://merribithouse.net/copytables/\">CopyTables</a>, a browser extension.\r\n<hr />\r\n[/expander_maker]\r\n<p />\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable toggleable-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"x\" style=\"text-align: right;\">Source (Hebrew)</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Translation (English)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\">\nמוֹדָה|מוֹדֶה אֲנִי לְפָנֶיךָ<br />\nמֶֽלֶךְ חַי וְקַיָּם<br />\nשֶׁהֶחֱזַרְתָּ בִּי<br />\nהַהִתְגַּלְּמוּת שֶׁל נִשְׁמָתִי<br />\nבְּחֶמְלָה<br />\nרַבָּה אֱמוּנָתֶךָ‏׃<br />\n</span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\">\nSo thankful am I before you,<br />\nLiving and enduring Majesty,<br />\nfor you have returned to me<br />\nthe embodiment of my soul<br />\nwith compassion.<br />\nSo great is your faith!</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Modeh Ani</em> first appeared as an addendum in <em>Seder ha-Yom</em> (1599) by Moshe ibn Makhir of Safed. Around February 2012, I was sitting with Ya&#8217;qub ibn Yusuf in his bookstore, <em><a href=\"http://www.olamqatan.com\">Olam Qatan</a></em> (then at 54 Emek Refaim in South Jerusalem), asking if he might share some useful practice that I might share through the Open Siddur Project. He offered this thought which he had heard from someone else. (Unfortunately, Ya&#8217;qub could not remember who taught this insight. If you know its origin, please <a href=\"/contact/\">contact us</a> or share in the comments.) The Hebrew adaptation and translation I&#8217;ve offered is based upon Ya&#8217;qub&#8217;s teaching.
