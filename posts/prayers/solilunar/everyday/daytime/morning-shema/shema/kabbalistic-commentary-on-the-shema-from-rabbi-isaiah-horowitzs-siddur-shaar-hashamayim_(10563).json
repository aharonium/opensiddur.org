            "bio": "Rabbi Isaiah Horovitz (Hebrew: ישעיה הלוי הורוויץ), (c. 1565 – March 24, 1630), also known as the Shelah ha-Kadosh (the holy Shelah) after the title of his best-known work, the <em>Shnei Luḥot HaBrit</em>. He was a prominent Levite rabbi and mystic. Isaiah Horovitz was born in Prague around 1565. His first teacher was his father, Avraham ben Shabtai Sheftel Horowitz, a notable scholar and author, and a disciple of Moses Isserles (Rema). Horowitz studied under Meir Lublin and Joshua Falk. He married Chaya, daughter of Abraham Moul, of Vienna, and was a wealthy and active philanthropist, supporting Torah study, especially in Jerusalem. In 1590, in Lublin, he participated in a meeting of the Council of Four Countries, and his signature is on a decree that condemns the purchase of rabbinic positions. In 1602, he was appointed head of Beis Din in Austria, and in 1606 was appointed Rabbi of Frankfurt am Main. In 1614, after serving as rabbi in prominent cities in Europe, he left Frankfurt—following the Fettmilch uprising—and assumed the prestigious position of chief rabbi of Prague. In 1621, after the death of his wife, he moved to Palestine, was appointed rabbi of the Ashkenazic community in Jerusalem, and married Chava, daughter of R. Eleazer. In 1625, he was kidnapped and imprisoned, together with 15 other Jewish rabbis and scholars, by the Pasha (Ibn Faruh) and held for ransom. After 1626, Horowitz moved to Safed, erstwhile home of Kabbalah, and later died in Tiberias on March 24, 1630 (Nissan 11, 5390 on the Hebrew calendar). In his many Kabbalistic, homiletic and halachic works, he stressed the joy in every action, and how one should convert the evil inclination into good, two concepts that influenced Jewish thought through to the eighteenth-century, and greatly influenced the development of the Ḥassidic movement.

This text is an excerpt from his kabbalistic prayer book, <em>Siddur Shaar haShamayim</em> (Gate of Heaven), which deals with the Shema prayer.</p>\n<p>According to Eliot Wolfson, the Shla went to Israel to study the work of the chariot, which was not pursued as strongly in Eastern and Central Europe. That he was very much influenced by Yitzḥak Luria is shown not only by his writings, but by his specific visit to Ḥayyim Vital&#8217;s son in Damascus where he was shown some uncirculated manuscripts.</p>\n<p>The majority of the material is a compilation of direct quotes from well-known kabbalistic writings (See the section in the bibliography under &#8220;Kabbalistic Sources.&#8221;) These texts mostly span the period from the 12th to 17th centuries and are written in Hebrew and a sort of Medieval Aramaic, thus serving as a microcosm of the Kabbalistic genre. Much work has been done over the last 70 years to translate and explain , and much remains to be done. Roughly 40% consists of Lurianic kavvanot quoted directly from the ARI of which a quarter consists of paraphrasing by the Shla. The remainder of the material quotes from Moshe Cordovero (<em>Pardes Rimonim</em>), Meir ibn Gabbai (<em>Avodat Hakodesh</em>, <em>Tolaat Yaakov</em>), and from the Zohar on Genesis.<span class=\"footnote_referrer\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_1');\" onkeypress=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_1');\" ><sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_1\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\">[1]</sup></a><span id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_1\" class=\"footnote_tooltip\"> Avrum Goodman credits the following translators:<br />\nEverett Fox, Torah and Samuel.

Within a specific quote, the various sentences appear in somewhat different sequence than in the most common version of the <em>Pri Etz Ḥayim</em>. It is possible that they are instead from <em>Shaar haKaavanot</em> (at least one excerpt definitely is), but I have not managed to locate any version which has the excerpts in the same order. The other quotes do seem to match almost exactly.</p>\n<p>The rest of the material consists of paraphrases of various ideas by the author. Because all the discussion relates in one way or another to the Shema (either directly or through a closely related prayer), this text provides an interesting cross-section and comparison in the development and differentiation of kabbalistic understandings and practices.</p>\n<p>The original edition (p. 167-172 or 84a-86b) was five pages of very small Rashi script, divided into five paragraphs. A more recent edition (p. 329-338) has nine pages of somewhat larger Rashi script, with mostly correct references to text sources and multiple paragraphs. The original text has been retyped from the Rashi script to modern Hebrew script, with appropriate layout to better show the flow of the material. The seven original glosses (<em>hagahot</em>) are notated by a number enclosed in parentheses e.g. (1), and placed at the end of the texts which they refer to. I have added interlineal comments in square brackets []. The notes are simple and serve only as an aid to explain specific limited matters, such as the calculations for various gematria, or point to a related discussion. </p>\n<p>Textual analysis has generally been limited to the historical, literary, philosophical, or religious. There are three inter-twined approaches which would be fruitful in new ways:</p>\n<p>a. \tscientific &#8211; Lurianic thought especially can be seen as a precursor to and influence on modem scientific thinking.<br />\nb. \tdepth psychology/comparative mysticism- the kavvanot&#8217;s dynamics can be illuminated by comparison with other explorations of the psyche<br />\nc. \tvisual thinking and creativity &#8211; The facility to think visually is necessary to appreciate much of the Kabbalah, and is significant in relating to kavvanot as a creative process.</p>\n<p>By addressing the first three challenges, it is possible to attempt the fourth, by making it possible for experts in those fields to approach the original texts, rather than only through interpretations and translations. [It is recommended to supplement this with access to one of a number of glossaries and the <em>Encyclopedia Judaica</em>.] One example of following these other approaches is to correlate kavvanot with processes of scientific creativity and inspiration.\n</div>\n<style type=\"text/css\">\r\n       .errordiv { padding:10px; margin:10px; border: 1px solid #555555;color: #000000;background-color: #f8f8f8; width:500px; }#advanced_iframe {visibility:visible;opacity:1;vertical-align:top;}.ai-info-bottom-iframe { position: fixed; z-index: 10000; bottom:0; left: 0; margin: 0px; text-align: center; width: 100%; background-color: #ff9999; padding-left: 5px;padding-bottom: 5px; border-top: 1px solid #aaa } a.ai-bold {font-weight: bold;}#ai-layer-div-advanced_iframe p {height:100%;margin:0;padding:0}#ai-div-container-advanced_iframe\r\n       { \r\n           position: relative;\r\n           width: 100%; max-width: 100%;}\r\n       #ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe\r\n       {\r\n          position: absolute;\r\n          z-index:1000;\r\n          margin-left:-33px;\r\n          left: 50%;   top: 150px;\r\n         }} \r\n       #ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe img\r\n       {\r\n          border: none;\r\n       }</style><script type=\"text/javascript\">var ai_iframe_width_advanced_iframe = 0;var ai_iframe_height_advanced_iframe = 0;var aiIsIe8=false;var aiOnloadScrollTop=\"true\";var aiShowDebug=false;\r\n\t\tif (typeof aiReadyCallbacks === 'undefined') {\r\n\t\t\tvar aiReadyCallbacks = [];  \r\n\t\t} else if (!(aiReadyCallbacks instanceof Array)) {\r\n\t\t\tvar aiReadyCallbacks = [];\r\n\t\t}    function aiShowIframeId(id_iframe) { jQuery(\"#\"+id_iframe).css(\"visibility\", \"visible\");    }    function aiResizeIframeHeight(height) { aiResizeIframeHeight(height,advanced_iframe); }    function aiResizeIframeHeightId(height,width,id) {aiResizeIframeHeightById(id,height);}</script><div id=\"ai-div-container-advanced_iframe\"><div id=\"ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-loader-icon\" src=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/plugins/advanced-iframe/img/loader.gif\" title=\"Loading\" alt=\"Loading\"></img></div><iframe id=\"advanced_iframe\"  name=\"advanced_iframe\"  src=\"https://archive.org/stream/understanding-kabbalistic-texts-shla-on-the-shema-annotated-translation-avrum-goodblatt/Avrum%20Goodblatt%20-%20Understanding%20Kabbalistic%20Texts%2C%20Shla%20on%20the%20Shema%20%28annotated%20translation%29#page/n0/mode/2up\"  width=\"100%\"  height=\"900\"  frameborder=\"0\"  allowtransparency=\"true\"  loading=\"lazy\"  style=\";width:100%;height:900px;;width:1px;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;\"  allowfullscreen  onload='jQuery(&quot;#ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe&quot;).hide();;jQuery(&quot;#ai-div-loader-global&quot;).hide()' ></iframe></div><script type=\"text/javascript\">var ifrm_advanced_iframe = document.getElementById(\"advanced_iframe\");var hiddenTabsDoneadvanced_iframe = false;\r\nfunction resizeCallbackadvanced_iframe() {}var recalculateIframeResizeadvanced_iframe = 0;\r\n        var recalculateIframeOrientationchangeadvanced_iframe = 0;\r\n        var aiWindowWidth = 0;\r\n\t\tfunction recalculateIframeadvanced_iframe() {\r\n          clearTimeout(recalculateIframeResizeadvanced_iframe);\r\n          clearTimeout(recalculateIframeOrientationchangeadvanced_iframe);}  \r\n        function initResponsiveIframeadvanced_iframe() {\r\n          jQuery(window).resize(function() {\r\n\t\t\t recalculateIframeResizeadvanced_iframe = window.setTimeout(\"recalculateIframeadvanced_iframe()\",100);\r\n          });\r\n          if (window.addEventListener) {\r\n            window.addEventListener(\"orientationchange\", function() {\r\n               recalculateIframeOrientationchangeadvanced_iframe = window.setTimeout(\"recalculateIframeadvanced_iframe()\",100);\r\n            }, false);\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n        aiReadyCallbacks.push(initResponsiveIframeadvanced_iframe);</script><style>#advanced_iframe {width: 1px !important;min-width:100% !important;max-width:100% !important;}</style><script type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n<hr />\n<p><em>We are grateful to Avrum Goodblatt for sharing this transcription accompanied by his notes, originally prepared in 2001 for an undergraduate degree in Religious Studies (minor in Jewish Studies) from the University of California at Santa Cruz.
