He studied at the University of Strasbourg before he was ordained in 1896 at Hebrew Union College. He served as rabbi of Little Rock, Arkansas's Temple B’nai Israel from 1897 to 1899, after which he came to Congregation B’nai Jehudah in Kansas City, Missouri. In 1913, he authored <em>The truth about the Russian government and the ritual murder trial</em>. In 1926, he was commended by the American Eugenics Society's Committee on Cooperation with Clergymen for a special Mother’s Day service in which he declared in a sermon: “May we do nothing to permit our blood to be adulterated by infusion of blood of inferior grade” (Daniel J. Kevles, page 61 in <em>In the Name of Eugenics</em>, 1985).",
