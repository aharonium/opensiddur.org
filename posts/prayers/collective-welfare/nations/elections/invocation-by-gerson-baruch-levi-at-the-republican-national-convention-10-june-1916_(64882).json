He was educated at the University of Pennsylvania, receiving his doctorate there in 1910. Although ordained by the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, Levi became a proponent of Reform Judaism and was mentored by Emil G. Hirsch. Spending the bulk of his career in Chicago after a short stint in Helena, Arkansas, Levi was active in many Reform organizations and was the editor of <em>The Reform Advocate</em>.  Among other works, he was the author of <em>Gnomic Literature in Bible and Apocrypha</em> (1917) and was involved in Chicago communal affairs.",
