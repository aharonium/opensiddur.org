Following his family’s return to the U.S, he became the Director of the Shul School at Kehilat HaNahar in New Hope, Pennsylvania. While managing the supplementary school, Rabbi Rank co-led a Virtual Youth Arts Beit Midrash serving youth across five states, designed a virtual reality Purim carnival, and created curricular materials for young Jews to engage with Jewish notions of responsibility towards marginalized communities and to the planet. Rabbi Rank has authored several academic articles, served as the Managing Editor of <em>Zeramim: An Online Journal of Applied Jewish Studies</em>, and is currently editing <em>Siddur Kanfey HaShekhinah</em>, a forthcoming traditional Ashkenazi Hebrew prayer book, where the language referring to God is with feminine grammar.
