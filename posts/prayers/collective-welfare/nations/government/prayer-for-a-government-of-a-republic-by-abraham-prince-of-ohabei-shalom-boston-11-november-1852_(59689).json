In the 1840s, he was among the first seven trustees of Boston's charter synagogue Ohabei Shalom, and in 1845, served on the three-person founding committee that authored its constitution and by-laws. In 1854, he joined with his colleagues in founding the Hebrew Mutual Relief Society and serving as trustee. After a schism between German and Polish Jews in 1854, he became president of the more traditional (and Polish) Warren Street synagogue from 1856-1857. With the tailor, Henry S. Spier, he formed an ad hoc committee representing the Warren Street and Pleasant Street congregations, which in 1858 commended the British government for granting Jews full emancipation. In 1863, he served as president of Ohabei Shalom and gave an address recounting the 25 year history of the community.",

    "content": "<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">\n<blockquote><p>\nBOSTON, Nov. 11th, 1852.</p>\n<p>DEAR SIR: The following Prayer which was written for and adopted by our Congregation in place of the <em>Hanosan Teschuoh</em> will, I trust, recommend itself to the approbation of every American Israelite—being, as I fully believe it is, more suitable to our condition as the free citizens of a Republic, then are those prayers used on like occasions in most of our Synagogues which, however variously modified, all betray that they originated in countries where kingly powers, and in many instances oppression prevails towards those professing our creed. </p>\n<p>It is also more in harmony with the institutions of our country, for whereas the usual player has &#8220;exalt and highly aggrandise&#8221; we cannot offer such a prayer without treason to our country, for the office of President, being the most exalted in the gift of the American people, further to exalt or aggrandise the office must be at the expense of their liberty. (Louis Napoleon&#8217;s aggrandisement for example.) I also trust that its sentiments in another respect are more in harmony with the improved opinions of our days, for while the European prayer expresses a desire for conquest over their enemies, this prayer asks for universal peace. In conclusion, I need scarcely state that it is given entirely in English, and I believe that improves on the usual rendering part in Hebrew and part English.</p>\n<p>I am, most truly and respectfully yours,<br />\nA.
