            "bio": "Rabbi Louis Ginzberg (Hebrew: לוי גינצבורג‎, Levy Gintzburg) was a Talmudist and leading figure in the Conservative Movement of Judaism of the twentieth century. He was born on November 28, 1873, in Kaunas, Vilna Governorate (then called Kovno). Ginzberg was born into a religious family whose piety and erudition was well known. The family traced its lineage back to the revered talmudist, halachist, and kabbalist Gaon of Vilna. Ginzberg emulated the Vilna Gaon’s intermingling of ‘academic knowledge’ in Torah studies under the label ‘historical Judaism’. In his book <em>Students, Scholars and Saints</em>, Ginzberg quotes the Vilna Gaon instructing, “Do not regard the views of the Shulchan Aruch as binding if you think that they are not in agreement with those of the Talmud.” Ginzberg first arrived in America in 1899, unsure where he belonged or what he should pursue. Almost immediately, he accepted a position at Hebrew Union College and subsequently wrote articles for the Jewish Encyclopedia. In 1903, he began teaching at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTS) in New York City, where he taught until his death. He died on November 11, 1953, in New York City.

Farbridge (1927), p.200, and in <em>The Respona of Professor Louis Ginzberg</em>, ed. D. Golinkin (1996). This is a new translation (2010) by Tim Daniel Bernard, closely following the the original Hebrew Prayer. </p>\n<p>In his article &#8220;<a class=\"pdf\" href=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Conservative_Payerbooks_(Eric_L._Friedland,_1976).pdf\">Conservative Prayerbooks</a>&#8221; written for the <em>Jewish Spectator</em> in 1976, Dr. Eric Friedland had this to say about the <em>Festival Prayer Book</em> and Louis Ginzburg&#8217;s Prayer for the Government:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The <em>Festival Prayerbook</em> (1927, under the auspices of the United Synagogue of America), the first publication to bear the stamp of the Conservative Movement, shared not a few of the characteristics of the liturgical productions of Britain&#8217;s Orthodox United Synagogue, the <em>Authorized Daily Prayerbook</em> and various mahzorim, noted for their neat and orderly layout, textual accuracy, and judicious curtailment of piyyutim. The early disciples of Solomon Schechter, who himself had spent some time in Cambridge before he came and settled in New York to put the then-teetering Jewish Theological Seminary on its feet, were not impervious to the neo-classical trend of the nineteenth-century Anglo-Catholic Tractarians of the Church of England. While the elevated, formal &#8220;high-church&#8221; tone of the <em>Festival Prayerbook</em> has long since been supplanted, many of that prayerbook&#8217;s meticulous standards have been retained. One innovation that has perdured is Professor Louis Ginzberg&#8217;s Prayer for the Government. The entreaty is patriotic in the best sense of the term with scarce a trace of jingoism. Its longevity is warranted.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In his review, Dr. Friedland was speaking specifically of Ginzberg&#8217;s original Hebrew liturgy. The prayer was republished with slightly altered Hebrew text in <em><a href=\"/?p=15128\">Seder Tefilot Yisrael: Sabbath and Festival Prayer Book</a></em>, compiled by the Rabbinical Assembly &#038; United Synagogue of America (1946) p.130, and in <em>Sim Shalom</em> (1985) p.414-415. The translation of the prayer as found in <em>Sim Shalom</em> was read into the <a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CREC-1994-02-23/html/CREC-1994-02-23-pt1-PgS2.htm\">Congressional Record</a> (vol. 140, no. 16, Wednesday 23 February 1994) by Rabbi Paul D. Kerbel of Congregation Nevey Shalom, Bowie, Maryland on 1994. (There is also a delightful recording of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, z&#8221;l, offering it at Congregation Beth El in Bethesda, Maryland, on October 3rd, 2013.) </p>\n<p>A new English translation of Louis Ginzberg&#8217;s Prayer for the Government was the main impetus behind Rabbi Tim Bernard&#8217;s contribution. As Rabbi Bernard explains:</p>\n<blockquote><p>This translation is more straightforward, less archaic, and much closer to original Hebrew than the traditional translation found in Conservative prayer books published between 1927 and 2005.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Source</h3>\n<style>\n       .errordiv { padding:10px; margin:10px; border: 1px solid #555555;color: #000000;background-color: #f8f8f8; width:500px; }#advanced_iframe {visibility:visible;opacity:1;vertical-align:top;}.ai-info-bottom-iframe { position: fixed; z-index: 10000; bottom:0; left: 0; margin: 0px; text-align: center; width: 100%; background-color: #ff9999; padding-left: 5px;padding-bottom: 5px; border-top: 1px solid #aaa } a.ai-bold {font-weight: bold;}#ai-layer-div-advanced_iframe p {height:100%;margin:0;padding:0}#ai-div-container-advanced_iframe\n       {\n           position: relative;\n           width: 100%; max-width: 100%;}\n       #ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe\n       {\n          position: absolute;\n          z-index:1000;\n          margin-left:-33px;\n          left: 50%;   top: 150px;\n         }}\n       #ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe img\n       {\n          border: none;\n       }</style><script type=\"text/javascript\">var ai_iframe_width_advanced_iframe = 0;var ai_iframe_height_advanced_iframe = 0;var aiIsIe8=false;var aiOnloadScrollTop=\"true\";var aiShowDebug=false;\n\t\tif (typeof aiReadyCallbacks === 'undefined') {\n\t\t\tvar aiReadyCallbacks = [];\n\t\t} else if (!(aiReadyCallbacks instanceof Array)) {\n\t\t\tvar aiReadyCallbacks = [];\n\t\t}    function aiShowIframeId(id_iframe) { jQuery(\"#\"+id_iframe).css(\"visibility\", \"visible\");    }    function aiResizeIframeHeight(height) { aiResizeIframeHeight(height,advanced_iframe); }    function aiResizeIframeHeightId(height,width,id) {aiResizeIframeHeightById(id,height);}</script><div id=\"ai-div-container-advanced_iframe\"><div id=\"ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-loader-icon\" src=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/plugins/advanced-iframe/img/loader.gif\" title=\"Loading\" alt=\"Loading\" /></div><iframe id=\"advanced_iframe\"  name=\"advanced_iframe\"  src=\"https://archive.org/stream/estivalprayerbookunitedsynagogueofamerica1927#page/n408/mode/2up\"  width=\"100%\"  height=\"900\"  frameborder=\"0\"  border=\"0\"  allowtransparency=\"true\"  loading=\"lazy\"  style=\";width:100%;height:900px;;width:1px;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;\"  allowfullscreen  onload='jQuery(&quot;#ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe&quot;).hide();;jQuery(&quot;#ai-div-loader-global&quot;).hide()' ></iframe></div><script type=\"text/javascript\">var ifrm_advanced_iframe = document.getElementById(\"advanced_iframe\");var hiddenTabsDoneadvanced_iframe = false;\nfunction resizeCallbackadvanced_iframe() {}var recalculateIframeResizeadvanced_iframe = 0;\n        var recalculateIframeOrientationchangeadvanced_iframe = 0;\n        var aiWindowWidth = 0;\n\t\tfunction recalculateIframeadvanced_iframe() {\n          clearTimeout(recalculateIframeResizeadvanced_iframe);\n          clearTimeout(recalculateIframeOrientationchangeadvanced_iframe);}\n        function initResponsiveIframeadvanced_iframe() {\n          jQuery(window).resize(function() {\n\t\t\t recalculateIframeResizeadvanced_iframe = window.setTimeout(\"recalculateIframeadvanced_iframe()\",100);\n          });\n          if (window.addEventListener) {\n            window.addEventListener(\"orientationchange\", function() {\n               recalculateIframeOrientationchangeadvanced_iframe = window.setTimeout(\"recalculateIframeadvanced_iframe()\",100);\n            }, false);\n          }\n        }\n        aiReadyCallbacks.push(initResponsiveIframeadvanced_iframe);</script><style>#advanced_iframe {width: 1px !important;min-width:100% !important;max-width:100% !important;}</style><script type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Recordings</h3>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Congregation Beth El: Prayer for Country by Ruth Bader Ginsburg z&quot;l\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SMSuwe-j4tg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
