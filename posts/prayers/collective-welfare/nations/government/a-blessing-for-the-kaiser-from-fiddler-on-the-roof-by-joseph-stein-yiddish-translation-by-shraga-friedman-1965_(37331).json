Born in New York City to Jewish parents, Charles and Emma (Rosenblum) Stein, who had immigrated from Poland, Stein grew up in the Bronx. He graduated in 1935 from CCNY, with a B.S. degree, then earned a Master of Social Work degree from Columbia University in 1937. He began his career as a psychiatric social worker from 1939 until 1945, while writing comedy on the side. A chance encounter with Zero Mostel led him to start writing for radio personalities, including Henry Morgan, Hildegarde, Tallulah Bankhead, Phil Silvers, and Jackie Gleason. He later started working in television for Sid Caesar when he joined the writing team of Your Show of Shows that included Woody Allen, Mel Brooks, Carl Reiner, and Neil Simon.",

To me an opening number had to be snappy and get down to about three or four minutes, and of course I was terrified that the whole show was too long, and that it was going to be too serious and too Jewish and a disaster. But [the director/choreographer, Jerry] Robbins  wasn’t worried about that. As the number was getting longer and longer, I suddenly realized I was watching a man literally mold a number out of pieces. <em>Joe Stein would give him some dialogue</em>—I guess I had written the lyrics already—but I think Jerry Bock had to keep supplying him with music, and it took shape like a piece of sculpture” (from Richard Altman &#038; Mervyn Kaufman, <em><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/makingofmusical00altm\">The Making of a Musical: Fiddler on the Roof</a></em>, 1971, p.31, emphasis mine). It&#8217;s possible, however, that the lines may have been adopted by Stein from an earlier source (perhaps even from a story by Sholom Aleichem). If you know, please leave a comment below or <a href=\"/contact/\">contact us</a>.</p>\n<p>From Stein and Harnick&#8217;s work, Shraga Friedman prepared a Yiddish translation for an Israeli production of the musical &#8212; <span class=\"hebrew\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidler_Afn_Dakh\">פידלער אױפן דאך</a></span> (<em>Fiddler Oyfen Dakh</em>, 1965). The text here is as copied from the scripts prepared by the <a href=\"https://nytf.org\">National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene</a> (<a href=\"https://nytf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/פֿידלער-אױפֿן-דאַך.pdf\">Yiddish</a> | <a href=\"https://nytf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Fiddler2018_Lyrics.pdf\">English</a>). There are some differences in the text found in Yiddish and in the English script, with <span class=\"hebrew\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">באַזונדערע</span> missing in the former. There are also minor differences between the lines presented here and those read in the popular 1965 cast recording, with &#8216;Tsar&#8217; replacing &#8216;Kaiser&#8217; in both lines. In the 1971 film adaptation using the English script, the name of the questioner was changed from Mendl to Leibl.</p>\n<p>We are grateful to Yoni Oppenheim (Artistic Director at 24/6: A Jewish Theater Company) for his research help with the Yiddish script. </p>\n<h3>Recordings</h3>\n<!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('audio');</script><![endif]-->\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-0-1\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://archive.org/download/lp_a-pidler-auipn-da_shmuel-rudenski/disc1/01.01.%20Tradition%20%3D%20%D7%93%D7%99%20%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94.mp3?_=1\" /><a href=\"https://archive.org/download/lp_a-pidler-auipn-da_shmuel-rudenski/disc1/01.01.%20Tradition%20%3D%20%D7%93%D7%99%20%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94.mp3\">https://archive.org/download/lp_a-pidler-auipn-da_shmuel-rudenski/disc1/01.01.%20Tradition%20%3D%20%D7%93%D7%99%20%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94.mp3</a></audio>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
