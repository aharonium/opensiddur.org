Mr. Speaker, it is an honor and a pleasure to welcome, as our guest this afternoon, Rabbi David A. Nelson of Congregation Beth Shalom, in Oak Park, Michigan. I would like to thank him for his inspiring opening prayer.</p>\n<p>Before coming to Michigan, Rabbi Nelson held pulpits in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and in our neighboring city of Baltimore, Maryland. In 1972, he took up his present position at Congregation Beth Shalom.</p>\n<p>While providing spiritual leadership to the people of his congregation, Rabbi Nelson has also been an active community leader.</p>\n<p>He has served as president of the Conservative Rabbis of Metropolitan Detroit; a member of the Anti-Defamation League Cabinet; and as a member of the Detroit Round Table of the National Conference of Christians and Jews. He is also the director of the Michigan Region of the United Synagogues of America. Rabbi Nelson was also appointed by the city of Southfield, Michigan, to serve as a member of the Total Living Commission, and as an advisory board member to the Southfield City Council. He is also on the advisory board of the Oakland County Mental Health Associates and the Michigan Council on Alcohol Problems.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Nelson is not the first member of his family to offer the opening prayer before this body. On May 23, 1963, the House of Representatives was honored to hear the profound words of his father, the late Rabbi Harry Nelson.</p>\n<p>Mr. Speaker, Rabbi Nelson is accompanied by two of his three children this afternoon, Harry, age 11, and Debra, age 10.</p>\n<p>I would like to welcome all three to Washington, and to again thank Rabbi David Nelson for his inspirational message.\n</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<hr />\n\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable toggleable-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"x\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"/translate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contribute&nbsp;a&nbsp;translation</a></th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Source (English)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nO <span class=\"divine-referent\">Lord our God</span>,<br />\nhow excellent is Thy name in all the Earth<br />\nand without whom no human work can long prosper,<br />\nwe beseech Thee<br />\nto bestow upon the Members of this body<br />\nwisdom and courage<br />\nequal to their responsibilities.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nWe acknowledge with gratitude<br />\nthe glorious achievements<br />\nin working for the cause of peace<br />\nin the Middle East.<br />\nHelp us now<br />\nto widen the horizons of our hearts<br />\nto encompass all mankind<br />\nin a common love<br />\nand mutual respect.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nGrant that our beloved country<br />\nbe a mighty force for righteousness among people,<br />\never seeking to provide more adequate forms<br />\nof freedom and justice<br />\nfor all its citizens<br />\nand ever advancing the cause of democracy and peace<br />\namong all nations of the world.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nMay <span class=\"divine-referent\">the Lord</span> endow us with strength;<br />\nmay <span class=\"divine-referent\">the Lord</span> bless us all with peace.<br />\n<em>Amen</em>.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<p>This prayer of the guest chaplain was offered in the second month of the second session of the 96th US Congress in the House of Representatives, and published in the <em>Congressional Record</em>, vol. 125, part 5 (1979), page 6283. </p>\n<h3>Source(s)</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_55042\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Congressional-Record-vol-125-part-5-27-March-1979-p--6283.png\" rel=\"lightbox-0\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-55042\" src=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Congressional-Record-vol-125-part-5-27-March-1979-p--6283-250x250.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-55042\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-55042\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Congressional Record, vol 125, part 5 (27 March 1979), p. 6283</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
