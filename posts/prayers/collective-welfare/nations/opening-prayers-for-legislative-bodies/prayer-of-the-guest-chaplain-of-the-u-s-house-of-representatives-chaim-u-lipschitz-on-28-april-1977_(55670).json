    "content": "<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">\nGuest Chaplain: Rabbi Chaim U. Lipschitz, Mesivta Talmudical Seminary, Brooklyn, New York<br />\nSponsor: Rep. James H. Scheuer (D-NY)<br />\nDate of Prayer: 28 April 1977</p>\n<p><!-- --></p>\n<blockquote><p>\nMr. SCHEUER. Mr. Speaker, Rabbi Chaim U. Lipschitz, who delivered our opening prayer, is a leader of New York&#8217;s Jewish community and a man of multifaceted roles and achievements. Presently Rabbi Lipschitz is the executive director of the Community Service Bureau of the Yeshivah Torah Vodaath in Brooklyn, N.Y.&#8211;one of America&#8217;s oldest and most distinguished rabbinical colleges. In addition, he serves as associate editor of the Jewish Press, the largest English language Jewish newspaper in the world.</p>\n<p>The list of achievements by Rabbi Lipschitz is far too extensive to cite. However, to gage something of the rabbi&#8217;s work, he has served as a member of the Advisory Council of the New York State Human Rights Commission; he has appeared in several CBS television network programs; he has served as an aide to the American Consul in Palestine in 1938; was an accredited press correspondent at the trial of Adolf Eichmann; authored a book for Jewish servicemen; contributed to the Encyclopedia Britannica; the American Educator Encyclopedia; and has written a variety of scholarly works on Jewish Talmudic law.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Lipschitz is a man of great energy. I know him also, however, as one who possesses great concern for unknown and unheralded individuals who need a helping hand. The Rabbi, in his weekly columns in the Jewish Press, consistently articulates the achievements of Jewish leaders as reflected in their concern for the individual. Indeed, Rabbi Lipschitz&#8217;s weekly Jewish Press cameo profiles carry messages of inspiration and encouragement.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Lipschitz has succeeded in providing to his American audiences renewed meaning and understanding of the lives of great European Jewish leaders who died in the dreadful holocaust, but who served their communities and their people with an indescribable courage, dignity, and self-sacrifice.</p>\n<p>In sum, Rabbi Chaim U. Lipschitz is a man of varied talents and accomplishments&#8211;a young man who grew up in America and has translated the American dream into his own unique blend of rabbi, writer, activist, scholar, and teacher. I am delighted to have the pleasure of Rabbi Lipschitz&#8217;s visit with us and his inspirational prayer for the Members of the House of Representatives.\n</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<hr />\n\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable toggleable-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"x\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"/translate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contribute&nbsp;a&nbsp;translation</a></th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Source (English)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<span class=\"divine-referent\">God</span>, who art <span class=\"divine-referent\">the Creator</span>,<br />\nwe offer unto Thee our gratitude<br />\nfor the favors that we received from Thee,<br />\nand we ask with sincere desire<br />\nthat Thou will bring wisdom upon us,<br />\nthe servants of Thy people,<br />\nthat with understanding,<br />\nsound judgment,<br />\nand justice,<br />\nwe may act in behalf of all Thy people,<br />\nand thus act for Thee<br />\nand in the harmony of the symphony of life.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nMan is not only master of his destiny<br />\nby way of indeterminism.<br />\nHe is also a factor<br />\nin the affairs of the entire cosmos.<br />\nAs King David says in Psalms:<br />\n“The Earth hath He given to men” <span class=\"citation\">(Psalm 115:16)</span>.<br />\nWe assumed responsibility<br />\nfor the lot of the universe.<br />\nOur actions, our conduct<br />\ncan secure its existence<br />\nor destroy it.<br />\nThe fate of the Earth<br />\ndepends upon our behavior.<br />\nWe can delay<br />\nor accelerate the hour of erection<br />\nof “heaven’s kingdom” on Earth.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nBlessed be Thy <span class=\"divine-referent\">name</span>,<br />\nO <span class=\"divine-referent\">Sovereign of the world</span>.<br />\nMay it be acceptable before Thee<br />\nto prolong our lives<br />\nso that we may do good<br />\nto our fellow men<br />\nand follow in Thy path.<br />\n<em>Amen</em>.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<p>This prayer of the guest chaplain was offered in the fourth month of the first session of the 95th US Congress in the House of Representatives, and published in the <em>Congressional Record</em>, vol. 123, part 11 (28 April 1977), page 12617. </p>\n<h3>Source(s)</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_55672\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Congressional-Record-vol--123-part-11-28-April-1977-p--12617.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-55672\" src=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Congressional-Record-vol--123-part-11-28-April-1977-p--12617-250x250.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-55672\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-55672\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Congressional Record, vol. 123, part 11 (28 April 1977), p. 12617</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
