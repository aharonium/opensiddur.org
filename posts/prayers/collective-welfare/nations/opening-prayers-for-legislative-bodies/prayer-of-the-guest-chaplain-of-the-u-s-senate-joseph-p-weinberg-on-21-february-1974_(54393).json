Born in Chicago, Weinberg graduated from Northwestern University and immediately entered Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati. Following his ordination in 1963, he served as assistant rabbi at a San Francisco congregation before coming to Washington. He marched with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in Selma and was arrested twice, and in Washington, played a leading role in efforts to improve racial relations and fight poverty. He helped start Ya’chad, a Jewish organization promoting affordable city housing and Carrie Simon House, a transitional home for unmarried mothers in Northwest Washington. He was also a fervent supporter of Israel and campaigned for years to help Soviet Jews emigrate.",
