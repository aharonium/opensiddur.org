    "content": "<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">\nGuest Chaplain: Rabbi Maynard C. Hyman, Adas Yeshurun, Augusta, Georgia<br />\nSponsor: Rep. Doug Barnard Jr. (D-GA)<br />\nDate of Prayer: 28 March 1985</p>\n<p><!-- --></p>\n<blockquote><p>\nMr. BARNARD. Mr. Speaker, it is both a privilege and a pleasure to have Rabbi Maynard C. Hyman of the Adas Yeshurun Synagogue in Augusta, Georgia, as guest chaplain today in the House of Representatives.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Hyman was born and raised in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. He attended schools in New York, the Rabbinical Seminary of America and Brooklyn College, and is married to the former Evelyn Mitzner of New York. They have two children, Avi Dov and Syril, both born in Augusta. Their son, Avi Dov, is a student at Ner Israel Rabbinical College in Baltimore and their daughter, Syril, is a student at Bais Yaakov School for Girls, also in Baltimore.</p>\n<p>Today, March 28, marks a very special date for Rabbi Hyman. In Judaism, the number “28” is a significant number as it represents strength. Rabbi Hyman is celebrating his 20th year with the congregation in Augusta and 30 years in the rabbinate. He has previously served at the pulpit of the Congregation Beth Israel in Mahanoy City, Pennsylvania, and the Congregation Tifereth Zvi in Utica, New York.</p>\n<p>During his 20 years in Augusta, the congregation has celebrated their 95th anniversary. They have also experienced an impressive growth in membership, educational classes, youth activities and social functions. In 1969, because the congregation had outgrown their facilities, a new education and youth center and chapel building were added to the synagogue.</p>\n<p>In addition to his duties as rabbi, educational director and teacher, Rabbi Hyman is also the volunteer Jewish chaplain at Gracewood State School and Hospital in Augusta. He is a past officer of the university hospital clergy staff and his sermons have appeared in leading rabbinic sermon manuals. He has been honored on several occasions by such organizations as the Augusta Federations of Jewish Charities and the State of Israel Bond Organization. Rabbi Hyman has also contributed his time and energy to the Rabbinical Council of America, the New York Board of Rabbis, and the Yeshiva University Alumni Association.</p>\n<p>In introducing Rabbi Hyman today, I want to quote the rich, Jewish sources and traditions he represents. I find none more appropriate than the eloquent words of Maimonides, Rabbi Moses ben Maimon, whose 850th birthday is being celebrated this week worldwide.</p>\n<p>In the beginning of his magnum opus, the great Mishna Torah, he describes the ideal scholar and what distinguishes him from the rest of the people. He says in his book, <em>Hilchos Dayos</em>: &#8220;The scholar and wise man is not recognized only by his intellect and wisdom. He is also unique and recognized by his good deeds and mundane life, by his eating and drinking and daily dealings.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rabbi Hyman is distinguished not merely by his knowledge and wisdom but also by his sense of integrity and character, and his service to his fellow man.</p>\n<p>He devotes much of his time to speaking to non-Jewish groups in an effort to promote good will and understanding in the community of Augusta. He teaches by both word and example and his efforts have earned him the respect and admiration of both the Jewish and non-Jewish communities of Augusta.</p>\n<p>It is an honor to have Rabbi Hyman and his lovely family with us today, Mr. Speaker. We all thank him for giving the blessings of <span class=\"divine-referent\">the Lord</span> on this most significant day.\n</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable toggleable-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"x\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"/translate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contribute&nbsp;a&nbsp;translation</a></th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Source (English)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<span class=\"divine-referent\">Eternal God</span>,<br />\n<span class=\"divine-referent\">Father of all mankind</span>,<br />\nin the introduction to the Decalogue<br />\nThou hast declared,<br />\n“I am Thy <span class=\"divine-referent\">God</span><br />\nwho brought thee<br />\nout of the land of Egypt,<br />\nout of the house of bondage.” <span class=\"citation\">(Exodus 20:2)</span>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nThus, at the greatest moment in history<br />\nThou didst proclaim to all mankind<br />\nthat in freedom we must serve Thee.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nO’ <span class=\"divine-referent\">Lord</span>, we thank Thee<br />\nfor the privilege<br />\nand good fortune to live in a country<br />\nwhose leaders strive to enact laws<br />\nwhich promote religious pluralism<br />\nand multifaceted rights<br />\nfor all of its citizens.<br />\nWe pray that these ideals<br />\nbecome the heritage<br />\nof all the peoples<br />\nof the Earth.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nDo Thou bless and protect,<br />\nhelp and exalt<br />\nthe President,<br />\nVice President,<br />\nofficers,<br />\nand all the citizens<br />\nof this country.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nMay this be the will of <span class=\"divine-referent\">God</span>;<br />\nand let us say <em>amen</em>.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<p>This prayer of the guest chaplain was offered in the third month of the first session of the 99th US Congress in the House of Representatives, and published in the <em>Congressional Record</em>, vol. 131, part 5 (1985), page 6520. </p>\n<h3>Source(s)</h3>\n<p><span style=\"float: right;\"><div id=\"attachment_55080\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Congressional-Record-vol--131-part-5-28-March-1985-p--6520.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-55080\" src=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Congressional-Record-vol--131-part-5-28-March-1985-p--6520-250x250.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-55080\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-55080\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Congressional Record, vol. 131, part 5 (28 March 1985), p. 6520</p></div></span> <span style=\"float: left;\"><div id=\"attachment_55082\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Congressional-Record-vol--131-part-5-28-March-1985-p--6521.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-55082\" src=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Congressional-Record-vol--131-part-5-28-March-1985-p--6521-250x250.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-55082\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-55082\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Congressional Record, vol. 131, part 5 (28 March 1985), p. 6521</p></div></span><span class=\"\" style=\"display:block;clear:both;height: 0px;border-top-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;\"></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
