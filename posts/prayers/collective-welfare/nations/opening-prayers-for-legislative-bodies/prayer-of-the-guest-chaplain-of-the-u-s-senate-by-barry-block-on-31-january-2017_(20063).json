I am proud that he accepted our invitation to lead the Senate with his spiritual guidance.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Block is the leader of B&#8217;nai Israel&#8211;Arkansas&#8217;s largest Jewish congregation&#8211;a position he has held since 2013. I have gotten to know Rabbi Block and his dedication to his congregants through his annual visits to Washington with the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism. He has served Reform Judaism as a member of the Board of the Central Conference of American Rabbis and chair of its Resolutions and Nominating Committee and as president of the Southwest Association of Reform Rabbis.</p>\n<p>Serving as the guest Chaplain is an incredible honor. Today he is joined by his sons Robert and Daniel. He wished to share this experience with his congregants as well. I enjoyed meeting yesterday with him and his confirmation students to hear about their concerns on a wide variety of social issues. I appreciate his prayer for our country and its leaders.\n</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<hr />\n\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable toggleable-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"x\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"/translate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contribute a translation</a></th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Source (English)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nDivine Source of Blessing,<br />\nwe come before You today<br />\nto ask Your blessings on the United States Senate<br />\nand on the 100 men and women who serve our Nation here.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nLike King Solomon before them,<br />\nlet these Senators lead our Nation with wisdom,<br />\nwith Your Word and our Nation&#8217;s Constitution constantly guiding them<br />\nto pursue liberty and justice, opportunity and equality,<br />\nfor every man, woman, and child within our borders,<br />\nfor those who would peacefully seek refuge on our shores,<br />\nand for each of Your children on Earth.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nMake them ever mindful of Your command<br />\nto remember the heart of the stranger&#8211;<br />\nthe people most unlike them and the least powerful of voices&#8211;<br />\nfor we were all strangers in one Egypt or another.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nIn this age of division,<br />\nunite these Senators,<br />\nfor only when working together<br />\nacross party lines<br />\ndo they truly represent all Americans.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nTemper the majority&#8217;s resolve<br />\nwith humility.<br />\nLet the minority manifest an opposition<br />\nthat is as loyal as it is robust.<br />\nLet all come together<br />\nto ask Your choicest blessings<br />\non the United States of America.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n&nbsp;<br />\nאָמֵן׃<br />\n</span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nAnd let us say,<br />\n<em>Amen.</em>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<h3>Source(s)</h3>\n<p>115th Congress, 1st Session. <em>Congressional Record</em>, Issue: Vol. 163, No. 16 — Daily Edition (January 31, 2017)</p>\n<p><iframe width=530 height=312 src='https://www.c-span.org/video/standalone/?c4653819/rabbi-barry-block-congregation-bnai-israel-rock-arkansas' allowfullscreen='allowfullscreen' frameborder=0></iframe><span class=\"\" style=\"display:block;clear:both;height: 0px;border-top-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;\"></span></p>\n<style>\n       .errordiv { padding:10px;
