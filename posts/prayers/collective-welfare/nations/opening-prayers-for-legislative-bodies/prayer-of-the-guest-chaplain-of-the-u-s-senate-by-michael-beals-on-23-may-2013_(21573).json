    "content": "<p>Guest Chaplain: Rabbi Michael Beals, Congregation Beth Shalom, Wilmington, DE.<br />\nDate of Prayer: May 23, 2013</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>Welcoming the Guest Chaplain:</h3>\n<p>Mr. COONS. Mr. President, thank you for the opportunity to recognize and celebrate this morning&#8217;s Chaplain. Rabbi Michael Beals has served our community in Wilmington, DE, and our country admirably and with a strength of faith and foundation that you have heard in this morning&#8217;s prayer. He is joined by his wife Elissa, a caring veterinarian, his daughter Ariella, whose bat mitsvah was just celebrated, and his daughter Shira and many other family and friends. He has a wonderful and accomplished education, being ordained at the Jewish Theological Seminary and also having studied at the American University, the University of California at Berkeley, and the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.</p>\n<p>In addition to his remarkable education, he is someone who is profoundly grounded in the calling, in the challenge of rebuilding. As you heard in his reflections in prayer this morning, he is someone who cares deeply for the widow, the orphan, the stranger, and is true to the Biblical calling of us to be witnesses to our communities wherever we might be found.</p>\n<p>I am grateful for the chance to add his voice to the many who have brought this Senate into session year in and year out over the centuries, and I am grateful for his friendship and leadership in my hometown of Wilmington, DE.</p>\n<p>The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.</p>\n<p>Mr. REID. With the Republican leader&#8217;s consent, I ask now that the senior Senator from Delaware be allowed to say a few words regarding our guest Chaplain.</p>\n<p>The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.</p>\n<p>Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, Senator Coons and I spent a couple of lovely hours together in Michael Beals&#8217; synagogue last Saturday as his daughter was going through bat mitsvah. I will never forget that occasion. What a joy for everyone there, people from all over the country. I know it was a source of family pride for the father, the mom, and for the rabbi to be there with their daughter on that special day.</p>\n<p>To my colleagues I would say that one of the things I pray for every day is that we will find our way to a two-state solution in the Middle East that provides a homeland for the Palestinians, a capital for the Palestinians, and security for the people of Israel and peace for the people of Israel.</p>\n<p>There is a great partnership in our State between Rabbi Beals&#8217; synagogue and my church and a number of other churches of different faiths. I just want to mention that here today and thank you for your commitment not just to the least of those in our society and those who need our help but also across the world to a really big trouble spot that needs our attention and our thoughts and our prayers. I thank you very much for being here today. Thank you for your prayer.</p>\n<p>I thank the leader for letting me say a few words.\n</p></blockquote>\n<hr />\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable toggleable-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"x\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"/translate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contribute a translation</a></th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Source (English)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nLet us join together in prayer.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nAdon Olam, Master of the Universe,<br />\nwe send our first prayer to the residents of Moore, OK.<br />\nMay it be Your will<br />\nthat those who are missing<br />\nbe found alive<br />\nand be cared for.<br />\nSend comfort to those who have suffered loss,<br />\nand with the help of those gathered here,<br />\nsend the resources required to rebuild.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nEternal our God,<br />\nYou commanded us<br />\nto care for the widow,<br />\nthe orphan,<br />\nand You commanded us to care for&#8211;<br />\nso appropriate today&#8211;<br />\nthe stranger in our midst.<br />\nThank You for giving our Nation<br />\nthese esteemed Senators<br />\nto help us as a nation<br />\nfulfill the command<br />\nto care for the most vulnerable<br />\nin our midst.<br />\nInto each of these honorable Senators<br />\nYou implanted Your divine spark.<br />\nHelp these Senators,<br />\nYour humble servants,<br />\nfind a way of working together<br />\nfor the common good.<br />\nIn doing so,<br />\nmay they thus take their individual holy inner lights<br />\nand join them together,<br />\ncreating one unified shaft of light<br />\nso strong<br />\nthat it will shine clear up<br />\nto the firmament above.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nאָמֵן׃<br />\n</span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nWe pray this in Your sacred and Holy Name.<br />\nAnd let us all say<br />\n<em>amen.</em>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<h3>Source(s)</h3>\n<p>113th Congress, 1st Session. <em>Congressional Record</em>, Issue: Vol. 159, No. 74 — Daily Edition (May 23, 2013)</p>\n<p><iframe width=530 height=312 src='https://www.c-span.org/video/standalone/?c4499895/rabbi-michael-beals-congregation-beth-shalom' allowfullscreen='allowfullscreen' frameborder=0></iframe><span class=\"\" style=\"display:block;clear:both;height: 0px;border-top-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;\"></span></p>\n<style>\n       .errordiv { padding:10px;
