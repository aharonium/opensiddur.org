He grew up in Chicago, Illinois where his father, Ephraim, was one of the most prominent rabbis of the Orthodox community.  In 1922, at Slabodka Yeshiva in Lithuania, he studied with his uncle, Rabbi Moshe Mordecai Epstein,\r\nand in British Mandate Palestine was one of the first students at the Hebron yeshivah. He received his semikhah from Rav Abraham Isaac Quq in 1925 and accepted his first pulpit at Congregation B'nai Emunah in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1927. A year later, at the age of 25, Rabbi Epstein left Tulsa for Ahavath Achim in Atlanta where it became one of the largest Conservative movement affiliated congregations in the South.",

Elliot Levitas (D-GA)<br />\nDate of Prayer: 16 March 1978</p>\n<p><!-- --></p>\n<blockquote><p>\nMr. LEVITAS. Mr. Speaker, for 50 years, Rabbi Harry H. Epstein has led the congregation of Ahavath Achim, in Atlanta, Ga. I have known and been guided by the spiritual wisdom of Rabbi Epstein all of my life, and I am happy he could be here today so that all of you might hear him.</p>\n<p>The rabbinical tradition is generations deep in Rabbi Epstein’s family. His grandfather, uncle, and father were rabbis. Rabbi Epstein was trained in the Slobodka Yeshiva, a seat of great rabbinical knowledge and headed by his uncle, himself a famous Talmudic scholar. He was also one of the first students at the Hebron Yeshiva in Palestine in 1924. He has distinguished himself as a rabbinic scholar as well as the leader of a congregation grateful for his devotion for all this time. He also holds a master&#8217;s degree from Emory University in Atlanta and a Ph.D. degree from the University of Illinois.</p>\n<p>His wonderful wife, Reva, is also descended from a family of rabbonim. Together they have provided Atlantans, Jewish and Christian, with a shining example of leadership, strength, and dedication.</p>\n<p>In addition to being our spiritual leader all these years, Rabbi Epstein and his wife have been close personal friends to my parents. We looked upon them as members of our family. My father was on the selection committee that chose him as our rabbi, and met him at the old Atlanta Terminal Station when he first arrived. The synagogue has dedicated this entire year to a celebration of his jubilee year, and it is our honor to have had Rabbi Epstein lead us in prayer today, as he has led me and the others of the Ahavath Achim congregation for so many years.\n</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable toggleable-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"x\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"/translate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contribute&nbsp;a&nbsp;translation</a></th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Source (English)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<span class=\"divine-referent\">Eternal God</span>,<br />\nreverently we ask your guidance<br />\nfor the Members of this House.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nMay the words here spoken<br />\nbroaden vision<br />\nand narrow division.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nMay the power of principle,<br />\nrather than the principle of power,<br />\nbe the measure of its deliberations.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nWe pray not for<br />\nease in resolving the responsibilities<br />\nof directing the affairs of our Nation,<br />\nfor we are aware that we live in days<br />\nlarge with challenge and perplexity.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nBut we do pray for<br />\nunderstanding adequate to the times’ demands,<br />\nfor integrity sufficient for the tasks,<br />\nfor vigilance to recognize all evil<br />\nplus steadfastness sufficient to overcome it,<br />\nand for compassion that embraces all people<br />\nin the circle of its concerns.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nMay we remember<br />\nthat “the effect of righteousness<br />\n(is) quietness and confidence forever.” <span class=\"citation\">(Isaiah 32:17)</span>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<p>This prayer of the guest chaplain was offered in the second month of the second session of the 95th US Congress in the House of Representatives, and published in the <em>Congressional Record</em>, vol. 124, part 6 (1978), page 7293. </p>\n<h3>Source(s)</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_54821\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Congressional-Record-vol--124-part-6-16-March-1978-p--7293.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-54821\" src=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Congressional-Record-vol--124-part-6-16-March-1978-p--7293-250x250.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-54821\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-54821\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Congressional Record, vol. 124, part 6 (16 March 1978), p. 7293</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
