William Lehman (D-FL)</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nMr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chaplain Ford for the privilege of having Rabbi David Saltzman as the guest chaplain this morning.  </p>\n<p>Rabbi Saltzman has served for the past 11 years as spiritual leader of the Aventura-Turnberry Jewish Center, a dynamic and growing congregation in our 17th Congressional District. This coming Sunday, I will be attending the official ceremony for the placing of the Torah in the new sanctuary.  </p>\n<p>Rabbi Saltzman was born in Brooklyn, NY, attended Flatbush Yeshiva High School, and graduated from Brooklyn College, after first spending his freshman year at Bar Ilan University during the time of the Sinai campaign. He was ordained at the Jewish Theological Seminary in 1965, where he was awarded the degree of doctor of divinity. He also holds a masters of Hebrew letters and master in academic administration.  </p>\n<p>Rabbi Saltzman has had a rich religious background, serving the spiritual needs of congregations in Massachusetts, New York, Illinois, and Florida, and as Navy chaplain in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and later with the marines in Vietnam.  </p>\n<p>This fall, Rabbi Saltzman will be leaving our community to serve as rabbi of the Conservative Congregation Moriah in Haifa, Israel. Our community will miss him, but we are most fortunate to have him with us today.\n</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable
