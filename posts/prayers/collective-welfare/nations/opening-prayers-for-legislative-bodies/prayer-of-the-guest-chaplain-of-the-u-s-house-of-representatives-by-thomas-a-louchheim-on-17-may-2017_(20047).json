    "content": "<p>Guest Chaplain: Rabbi Thomas A. Louchheim, Congregation Or Chadash, Tucson, AZ<br />\nSponsor: Rep. Martha McSally, (R-AZ)<br />\nDate of Prayer: 05/17/2017</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Rabbi Thomas Louchheim, who led us in the opening prayer. He is a rabbi at the Congregation Or Chadash in Tucson, Arizona. Rabbi Louchheim moved to Tucson with his wife, Marcia, in 1989 and has been a pillar in our community ever since.</p>\n<p>Having served as a rabbi at Temple Emanu–El and as an executive for Handmaker Hospice, he is a strong advocate for peace and religious harmony. He worked closely with the Muslim community in the aftermath of September 11 and has continued to promote understanding by organizing annual Muslim–Jewish peace walks.</p>\n<p>He founded the first Jewish–Christian–Muslim Scriptural study group in our community and has contributed to interfaith literature. In a world where religion too often divides us, Rabbi Louchheim has shown that we are all stronger together.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Louchheim&#8217;s influence extends past southeastern Arizona. In fact, his influence reaches beyond this Earth. The rabbi is a namesake for the only space object in the universe named after a rabbi, Asteroid 9584 Louchheim.</p>\n<p>I was honored to join Rabbi Louchheim in a Holocaust Remembrance walk last year. I have personally witnessed his compassion and leadership in the faith community in southeastern Arizona. I am honored to welcome him to the House of Representatives today and to personally thank him for offering this morning&#8217;s prayer.\n</p></blockquote>\n<hr />\n\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto;
