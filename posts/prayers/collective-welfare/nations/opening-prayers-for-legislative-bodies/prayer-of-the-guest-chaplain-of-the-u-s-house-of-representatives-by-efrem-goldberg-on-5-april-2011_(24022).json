Theodore Deutch, (D-FL)<br />\nDate of Prayer: 04/05/2011</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to welcome Rabbi Efrem Goldberg to our Nation&#8217;s Capitol and thank him for delivering such an insightful opening invocation.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Goldberg&#8217;s presence here today is especially significant to me, for I regularly study under his guidance. Since entering public life, I have become all the more grateful to have him as a spiritual mentor. His insights help me serve my constituents and work to better our world in a way that honors our Jewish tradition.</p>\n<p>As Senior Rabbi of Boca Raton Synagogue, Rabbi Goldberg leads a wonderful congregation of over 700 families and 1,200 children. This February, after an extraordinary first 5 years as Senior Rabbi, it was announced that he will continue to lead the congregation for the next decade.</p>\n<p>His energy, vision, and wisdom touch everyone he meets, just as it did for us here this morning when he provided us with his compelling and thoughtful invocation.\n</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto;
