Joshua Eilberg (D-PA)<br />\nDate of Prayer: 17 October 1967</p>\n<p><!-- --></p>\n<blockquote><p>\nMr. EILBERG, Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to you, to this House, and to Dr. Latch for the opportunity of having today’s opening prayer offered by the spiritual leader of my own congregation, Rabbi Leo Landman.</p>\n<p>As a member and trustee of Congregation Beth Emeth, I would like to say I am very proud of Dr. Landman. I hasten to add, however, that I hope no one will get the idea I have sought the pulpit of the House as a showcase for him through which other congregations may attempt to lure him from us. I hope he will remain in Philadelphia for as long a time as I know his words will remain with our Members of the House who are here to hear him today.</p>\n<p>The high regard in which we hold him is evidenced in part by the fact that a number of congregants sought to share the honor by accompanying him here from Philadelphia today. I wish to state that in addition to being spiritual leader of Congregation Beth Emeth, Dr. Landman holds a number of other distinctions.</p>\n<p>He is assistant to the president of Dropsie College for Hebrew and Cognate Learning, vice president of the Philadelphia Board of Rabbis and regional vice president of the rabbinic alumni of Yeshiva University.</p>\n<p>He is a graduate of both Yeshiva and Dropsie, from which he received his Ph.D.</p>\n<p>It is particularly fitting, I think, that in this body of representatives of all American people, our daily deliberations continue to be begun with a prayer for divine guidance. I am appreciative of the fact that my own congregation also has been allowed to share in these daily invocations.\n</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<hr />\n\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable toggleable-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"x\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"/translate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contribute&nbsp;a&nbsp;translation</a></th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Source (English)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<span class=\"divine-referent\">Almighty God</span>,<br />\nwe thank Thee<br />\nfor the blessings bestowed<br />\nupon our Nation.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nWe pray Thee,<br />\nmake us ever cognizant of the fact<br />\nthat liberty<br />\nand justice,<br />\nfreedom<br />\nand peace,<br />\nare not automatic possessions,<br />\nbut are gifts to be constantly guarded<br />\nin a ceaseless vigil<br />\ndemanding our best energies<br />\nand our devoutest zeal.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nBless the President,<br />\nthe Speaker,<br />\nand all Members of this House.<br />\nMay the harvest of their efforts<br />\nprovide amply for the body and soul<br />\nof each resident of this land.<br />\nMay they as leaders of our Nation<br />\nchoose programs of statesmanship<br />\nthat will alleviate the tensions that separate men,<br />\npromote harmonious human interdependence,<br />\nmake want and misery disappear,<br />\nand allow every man in every nation<br />\nto enjoy the blessings of freedom.<br />\n<em>Amen</em>.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<p>This prayer of the guest chaplain was offered in the tenth month of the first session of the 90th US House of Representatives, and published in the <em>Congressional Record</em>, vol. 113 part 21 (17 October 1967), page 29023. </p>\n<h3>Source(s)</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_56885\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Congressional-Record-vol--113-part-21-17-October-1967-p--29023.png\" rel=\"lightbox-0\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-56885\" src=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Congressional-Record-vol--113-part-21-17-October-1967-p--29023-250x250.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-56885\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-56885\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Congressional Record, vol. 113, part 21 (17 October 1967), p. 29023</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
