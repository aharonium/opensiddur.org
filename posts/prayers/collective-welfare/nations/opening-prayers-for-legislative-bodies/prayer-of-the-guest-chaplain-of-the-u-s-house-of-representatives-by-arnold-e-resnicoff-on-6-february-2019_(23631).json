Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Rabbi Arnold E. Resnicoff who led us in the opening prayer today.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Resnicoff is an American conservative rabbi who served as a military officer and military chaplain. He served in Vietnam and in Europe before attending rabbinical school, and then went on to serve as a U.S. Navy chaplain for almost 5 years. He promoted the creation of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and delivered the closing prayer in its 1982 dedication.</p>\n<p>In 1984, President Ronald Reagan spoke on his eyewitness account of the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing.</p>\n<p>After retiring from the military, the rabbi served as the National Director of Interreligious Affairs for the American Jewish Community and then special assistant to the Secretary and Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force, serving at the equivalent military range of brigadier general.</p>\n<p>Across his career, he received several awards including: the Defense Superior Service Medal, the Department of the Air Force Decoration for Exceptional Civilian Service, and the Chapel of Four Chaplains Hall of Heroes Gold Medallion.</p>\n<p>He has always been a spiritual inspiration, and now inspires me to Google how far the golf balls were hit on the Moon.</p>\n<p>Madam Speaker, I am honored to welcome Rabbi Resnicoff to the House of Representatives today, and personally thank him for his leadership and for offering the opening prayer.\n</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable toggleable-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"x\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"/translate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contribute a translation</a></th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Source (English)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nAlmighty God,<br />\nWE THE PEOPLE stand before you:<br />\nsome in prayer; all in need…\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\narmed with our founders’ prayers and dreams:<br />\nmore perfect union – less divided;<br />\nliberty and justice – for us and our posterity.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nWE THE PEOPLE don’t give up.<br />\nNeither should our leaders.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nLet our nation never slumber:<br />\nno closings, fits and starts;<br />\nno honest pay denied for honest work;<br />\nno time out from efforts to improve our lives,<br />\nachieve our dreams.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nOn this day – 1971 &#8212;<br />\nAlan Shepard hit two golf balls on the moon:<br />\nfirst human swings beyond the confines of the Earth.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nAt our best,<br />\nfair play defines our work,<br />\nwith some room for playfulness.<br />\nWe pursue, achieve, extraordinary dreams<br />\nwith humor, joy – a touch of grace.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nReignite that joy and grace, we pray;<br />\nmake no room for hate or threats,<br />\nor closing shop.<br />\nReignite our dreams,<br />\nas we &#8212; our better angels –<br />\nreunite for progress<br />\ntoward more perfect times.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n&nbsp;<br />\nאָמֵן׃<br />\n</span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nAnd may we say,<br />\n<em>Amen.</em>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<p>As Bill Platt <a href=\"https://news.dartmouth.edu/news/2019/02/rabbi-arnold-resnicoff-68-delivers-opening-prayer-us-house\">wrote in Dartmouth News</a>, </p>\n<blockquote><p>This was the 13th time that Resnicoff, who retired in 2001 after 25 years of service as a Jewish chaplain in the U.S. Navy, has delivered an opening prayer before Congress—eight times in the Senate and five in the House. </p>\n<p>“It was, as my friend Howard Mortman of C-SPAN observed, my bar mitsvah prayer—because it was number 13,” Resnicoff says.</p>\n<p>Prayers before Congress are limited to 150 words, must be submitted in advance for review, and cannot advocate for a specific policy or issue, Resnicoff says.
