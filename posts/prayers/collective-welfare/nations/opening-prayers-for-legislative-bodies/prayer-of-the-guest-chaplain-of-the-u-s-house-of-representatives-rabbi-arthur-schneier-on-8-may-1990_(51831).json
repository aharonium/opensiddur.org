    "content": "<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">\nGuest Chaplain: Rabbi Arthur Schneier, Park East Synagogue, New York, New York<br />\nDate of Prayer: 8 May 1990<br />\nSponsor: Rep. Sedgwick “Bill” Green (R-NY)</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nMr. GREEN. Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to welcome my friend, Rabbi Arthur Schneier, of the Park East Synagogue in New York City, who gave today&#8217;s opening prayer. </p>\n<p>Rabbi Schneier&#8217;s visit today is part of the commemoration of the 100th anniversary of this synagogue, which was founded in 1889.</p>\n<p>As Rabbi Schneier noted, today is also the 43rd anniversary of his arrival in the United States as a refugee from Europe. </p>\n<p>The Park East Synagogue is renowned for its contributions to Jewish life in New York City as well as throughout the United States and abroad. The synagogue, its rabbi, and its congregation have contributed to interreligious harmony and have been in the forefront of concern for Soviet and Eastern European Jewry and the State of Israel.</p>\n<p>The Park East Synagogue has benefited from the spiritual leadership of Rabbi Schneier for the past 28 years. Rabbi Schneier also leads the highly respected human rights organization, the Appeal of Conscience Foundation. This group of leaders from the Roman Catholic, Protestant, Greek Orthodox, Armenian Orthodox, and Jewish faiths has visited many countries including the Soviet Union, Hungary, and China in an effort to. protest repression of religious activity.</p>\n<p>On behalf of all of my colleagues, I extend a warm welcome to Rabbi Schneier and those members of the Park East Synagogue who made the trip to Washington to witness this extraordinary occasion. I should also like to thank Rabbi Schneier for giving the prayer today and for his dedication to the worldwide Jewish community and to interreligious accord.\n</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable toggleable-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"x\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"/translate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contribute a translation</a></th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Source (English)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nYou have delivered my soul from death. <span class=\"citation\">(Psalm 116:8 part)</span>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nYou have saved me from the Holocaust<br />\nand, 43 years ago today, on May 8, 1947,<br />\nyou brought me to the land of freedom and opportunity,<br />\nthe Nation of immigrants.<br />\nThis year you have given me the privilege<br />\nto preside over the centennial of my congregation,<br />\nPark East Synagogue,<br />\na major spiritual center in New York.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nGod bless America<br />\nthat gave so many of us a new lease on life<br />\nand remains the beacon of hope and faith<br />\nfor those deprived of human dignity and freedom,<br />\nthe home of churches and synagogues,<br />\nwhere each one of us can worship freely<br />\nand gain strength through moral values.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nThe ideology that sought to bury us<br />\nis now on its death bed.<br />\nAnd You, oh Lord,<br />\nare very much alive in the hearts of millions,<br />\nwho are hungry not only for food<br />\nbut yearn for spiritual sustenance.<br />\n&#8220;In God we trust&#8221; is now proclaimed<br />\nby nations of the velvet revolutions.<br />\nThe spirit of America has captured<br />\nthe hearts and minds of people throughout the world and,<br />\nas they grope to find their way from totalitarianism to democracy—<br />\nsometimes impassioned by nationalism and ethnic strife—<br />\nmay we share with them the benefits of pluralism and tolerance<br />\nand the blessing of unity in diversity.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nGod bless America<br />\n* * *<br />\nStand beside her and guide her.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<h3>Source(s)</h3>\n<p>101st Congress, 2nd Session. <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4503241/rabbi-arthur-schneier-park-east-synagogue-york-city\">C-SPAN</a>.<br />\n<em>Congressional Record</em>, <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/101/crecb/1990/05/08/GPO-CRECB-1990-pt7-5-2.pdf\">Vol. 136, Part 7 — Bound Edition, p. 9639</a>.</p>\n<p><iframe width=530 height=312 src='https://www.c-span.org/video/standalone/?c4503241/rabbi-arthur-schneier-park-east-synagogue-york-city' allowfullscreen='allowfullscreen' frameborder=0></iframe><span class=\"\" style=\"display:block;clear:both;height: 0px;border-top-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;\"></span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_51833\" style=\"width: 225px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Congressional-Record-v.-136-part-7-8-May-1990.-p.-9639.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-51833\" src=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Congressional-Record-v.-136-part-7-8-May-1990.-p.-9639-215x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"215\" height=\"300\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-51833\" srcset=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Congressional-Record-v.-136-part-7-8-May-1990.-p.-9639-215x300.png 215w, https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Congressional-Record-v.-136-part-7-8-May-1990.-p.-9639.png 1170w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-51833\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Congressional Record v. 136, part 7 &#8211; 8 May 1990. p. 9639</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
