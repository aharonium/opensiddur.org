Mr. President, I rise to thank and commend Senator Whitehouse for inviting Rabbi Leslie Gutterman here to deliver the prayer.</p>\n<p>Les Gutterman has been an extraordinary figure in our State, a man of great wisdom, compassion and kindness, who has, since 1970, contributed extraordinarily to the State of Rhode Island and to the people of Rhode Island.</p>\n<p>His congregation goes far beyond denominational lines. He is literally the rabbi for everyone. In fact, he is my rabbi, and I am pleased and proud to say that.</p>\n<p>Mr. President, again, I am delighted to welcome Rabbi Gutterman here today.</p>\n<p>The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.</p>\n<p>Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, it is a great honor and a great pleasure to join my senior Senator Jack Reed in welcoming Rabbi Leslie Gutterman from Providence, RI, here onto the Senate floor to open the Senate on this day by leading us in prayer.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Gutterman is a personal friend, but he is more than that. He is a person of real significance in the Rhode Island community. He has served as the rabbi of Temple Beth El for 40 years, which means he has officiated at the weddings of the children of people whose bar mitsvahs at which he officiated, and he has officiated at the bar mitsvahs of the grandchildren of people whose weddings at which he officiated. He is an important part of the Rhode Island community. He has been described as a community asset and a moral compass for Rhode Island. In addition, he is just a beautiful person.</p>\n<p>He and his wife Janet have come here today to join us, and we are very proud and delighted that we could share this moment of the morning with our colleagues and with Rabbi Gutterman.</p>\n<p>I yield the floor back to the majority leader with great pride in the presence of Rabbi Gutterman on our floor this morning.\n</p></blockquote>\n<hr />\n\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto;
