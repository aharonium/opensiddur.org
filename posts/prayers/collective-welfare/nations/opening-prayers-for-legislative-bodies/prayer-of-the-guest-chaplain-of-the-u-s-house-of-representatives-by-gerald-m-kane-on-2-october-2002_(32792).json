He earned his bachelor’s degree at the University of New York, Buffalo, and his Reform rabbinic ordination from Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in Cincinnati in 1970. Rabbi Kane served The Temple, Congregation B’nai Jehudah in greater Kansas City in the 1990s as its rabbi educator. After leaving B’nai Jehudah, he became rabbi at Temple Beth El, in Las Cruces in 1998. He retired in 2007 at which time he became rabbi emeritus. In retirement, he was the volunteer theatre and opera reviewer for the Las Cruces Bulletin as his “way of giving back to the community,” which warmly welcomed him in 1998.",

Joe Skeen (R-NM)<br />\nDate of Prayer: 10/02/2002</p>\n<p><!-- --></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>One Minute Speech Given in Recognition of the Guest Chaplain:</h3>\n<p>Mr. SKEEN. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to welcome our guest chaplain, Rabbi Gerald Kane, the rabbi of Temple Beth El in Las Cruces, New Mexico. Jewish pioneers have played an important role in the development of New Mexico for almost 200 years. Since the establishment of the first synagogue in 1883, New Mexico has benefited from the wisdom of many learned Jewish leaders. Rabbi Kane has continued that proud tradition. He grew up in New Jersey and graduated from the University of Buffalo. He was ordained from Hebrew Union College in 1970. For his long record of distinguished service, he received a doctor of divinity from Hebrew Union College in 1995. Rabbi Kane has helped guide many outstanding organizations around the United States. He has worked tirelessly for education and interfaith cooperation throughout our communities. He created programs to stop violence toward women and children and for supporting the battle on mental health. Southern New Mexico has also benefited from his love of the theater and his commitment to bring the arts to students everywhere. I welcome Rabbi Kane to the House of Representatives and thank him for his opening prayer this morning.\n</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<hr />\n\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable toggleable-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"x\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"/translate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contribute a translation</a></th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Source (English)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\">\n<h3>Opening Prayer Given by the Guest Chaplain:</h3>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\">\nDear God,<br />\nAuthor of life,<br />\nCreator of all:<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nAs we gather today<br />\nin this history-packed, awesome Chamber,<br />\nwe ask Your blessing on our esteemed Representatives<br />\nas they continue to help chart a course<br />\nfor our Nation and its citizens.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\">\nAlthough the times in which we are blessed to live<br />\nprovide them with many legislative challenges,<br />\nmay they, guided by Your wisdom,<br />\nseek the very best ways<br />\nto keep our country free from<br />\nprejudice,<br />\noppression<br />\nand strife.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\">\nIn these days of turbulence in our world,<br />\nkeep them steady in their deliberations.<br />\nInspire them to continue in their quest,<br />\nnot just for us,<br />\nbut for all citizens of this planet,<br />\nto promote the values upon which this great Nation was founded:<br />\njustice,<br />\nliberty,<br />\nequality,<br />\nfreedom<br />\nand peace.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\">\nLet Your blessing rest upon them<br />\nand be near to them.<br />\nGrant them strength<br />\nof body,<br />\nof health,<br />\nof mind.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\">\nLift up Your countenance upon us all,<br />\nand grant us Your most precious of blessings,<br />\nthe gift of <em>shalom</em>&#8212;<br />\nbalance<br />\nand peace.<br />\n<em>Amen</em>.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<h3>Source(s)</h3>\n<p>107th Congress, 2nd Session<br />\nIssue: Vol. 148, No. 127 — Daily Edition (October 2, 2002)</p>\n<p><iframe width=530 height=312 src='https://www.c-span.org/video/standalone/?c4506931/user-clip-rabbi-gerald-kane-temple-beth-el-las-cruces-nm' allowfullscreen='allowfullscreen' frameborder=0></iframe><span class=\"\" style=\"display:block;clear:both;height: 0px;border-top-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;\"></span></p>\n<p><!-- [advanced_iframe securitykey=\"be1d939e6a1b36109171c7d5503b34cf9147aa7b\" src=\"https://www.congress.gov/crec/2002/10/02/CREC-2002-10-02-pt1-PgH6929-3.pdf\" width=\"100%\" height=\"900\"] --></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crec/2002/10/02/CREC-2002-10-02-pt1-PgH6929-3.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Click to access CREC-2002-10-02-pt1-PgH6929-3.pdf</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
