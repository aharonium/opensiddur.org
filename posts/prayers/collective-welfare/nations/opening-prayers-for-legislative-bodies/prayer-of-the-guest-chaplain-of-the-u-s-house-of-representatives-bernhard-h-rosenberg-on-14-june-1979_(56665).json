Hamilton Fish (R-NY)<br />\nDate of Prayer: 14 June 1979</p>\n<p><!-- --></p>\n<blockquote><p>\nMr. FISH. Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to welcome to the Congress Rabbi Bernhard H. Rosenberg, a good friend and the spiritual leader of the First Hebrew Congregation of Peekskill, New York.</p>\n<p>Besides fulfilling his duties as the leader of a large and active congregation, Rabbi Rosenberg is also a well-known writer whose articles on Jewish survival and the holocaust have been published nationally. He is an individual who is very active in community affairs and contributes a great deal to the welfare of the Peekskill community. I have known Rabbi Rosenberg for some time and we have worked together on projects on behalf of the Jewish community of the Hudson Valley.</p>\n<p>He is a member of the Rabbinical Council of America, the New York Board of Rabbis, and the Yeshiva University Rabbinical Alumni. Rabbi Rosenberg has been involved as chairman and keynote speaker for numerous rallies on behalf of world Jewry and especially dealing with the memory of the six million Jewish martyrs that perished during the Holocaust. He is himself a son of survivors of the infamous death camp of Auschwitz.</p>\n<p>I am indeed fortunate to have had the opportunity to invite Rabbi Rosenberg to open our legislative session with a prayer this morning. Rabbi Rosenberg is clearly a gifted man who has given leadership to his congregation and his community. I am honored by his presence here this morning.\n</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<hr />\n\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable toggleable-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"x\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"/translate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contribute&nbsp;a&nbsp;translation</a></th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Source (English)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<span class=\"divine-referent\">Master of the Universe</span><br />\nWe gather today<br />\nto give glory and honor<br />\nto our flag and country.<br />\nOn June 14, 1777,<br />\nthe words of our valiant forefathers rang<br />\nthroughout the corridors<br />\nof our hearts.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nAmericans,<br />\ncommunicate these symbols to your children.<br />\nWhite signifies purity;<br />\nred, hardiness and valor;<br />\nblue, vigilance, perserverance, and justices.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nHope and liberty is our creed.<br />\nWe will not compromise in our resolve.<br />\nYes, we may have to sacrifice;<br />\nyet freedom is thicker than oil.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<span class=\"divine-referent\">God</span><br />\ngrant us the strength<br />\nand courage<br />\nto shine as the lighthouse<br />\nfor democracy.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nGrant us success<br />\nin the realm of commerce<br />\nand industry.</p>\n<p>Grant our leaders<br />\nthe intellectual and spiritual ability<br />\nto encourage, sustain and inspire<br />\nthe populace of our cherished and treasured country,<br />\nthe U.S.A.\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nGrant us the gift of shalom.<br />\n<em>Amen</em>.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<p>This prayer of the guest chaplain was offered in the sixth month of the first session of the 96th US Congress in the House of Representatives, and published in the <em>Congressional Record</em>, vol. 125, part 12 (14 June 1979), page 14951. </p>\n<h3>Source(s)</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_56667\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Congressional-Record-vol--125-part-12-14-June-1979-p--14951.png\" rel=\"lightbox-0\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-56667\" src=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Congressional-Record-vol--125-part-12-14-June-1979-p--14951-250x250.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-56667\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-56667\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Congressional Record, vol. 125, part 12 (14 June 1979), p. 14951</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
