He graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 1942 and, in 1948, was ordained at Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati. After pulpits in Spokane and Seattle, Washington, in 1955 he came to Temple Beth Israel in Phoenix, the first permanent Jewish congregation there since the early 1900s. He championed civil rights, supported the arts, and played a key role in establishing the Jewish Studies Program at Arizona State University (and taught there). For 25 years he volunteered as a chaplain at Phoenix Veterans Hospital. In 1972, the National Conference of Christians and Jews honored him with the National Award for Brotherhood. Following his retirement in 1992, Rabbi Plotkin pursued a professional singing career with the Arizona Opera.",

John Rhodes (R-AZ)<br />\nDate of Prayer: 17 May 1978</p>\n<p><!-- --></p>\n<blockquote><p>\nMr. RHODES. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to welcome Rabbi Albert Plotkin to the House Chamber. He has been rabbi of Temple Beth Israel in Phoenix for the past 23 years. It is true that he is the first resident of the First District in Arizona who has ever given a prayer here in the House of Representatives.</p>\n<p>I am particularly proud to be able to introduce my good friend for so many years. Rabbi Plotkin is an outstanding leader of the community. He is president of the North Phoenix Corporate Ministry, which is a social service organization formed by seven Jewish, Catholic, and Protestant congregations. He has served as chaplain of the Arizona State Senate, and he teaches classes at Arizona State University in Tempe. Several organizations in Phoenix have recognized Rabbi Plotkin&#8217;s contributions by naming him their “Man of the Year.”</p>\n<p>I would also like to point out something which I think will be of interest to everybody. Rabbi Plotkin is a graduate of Notre Dame University. He has the distinction of being the only rabbi who is a graduate of Notre Dame University.</p>\n<p>All Members of the House, I am sure, join me in thanking Rabbi Plotkin for being with us today and delivering his inspirational prayer.\n</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable toggleable-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"x\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"/translate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contribute&nbsp;a&nbsp;translation</a></th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Source (English)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<span class=\"divine-referent\">Almighty</span> and <span class=\"divine-referent\">merciful God</span>,<br />\nwe ask Thy blessings upon<br />\nthis great House of Representatives,<br />\nits devoted and consecrated servants,<br />\nthat they may ever be the guardians<br />\nof our rights and liberties,<br />\nso they may hold a beacon light of hope<br />\nfor the Nation.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nGive them the courage<br />\nto make decisions<br />\nwith clean hands<br />\nand upright spirits.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nCause them not to be disheartened or discouraged<br />\nby the crisis they face,<br />\nbut make them grow stronger<br />\nby facing the challenges,<br />\nmoving forward to build our Nation<br />\non the foundations of justice and righteousness.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nImbue them with wisdom<br />\nso the work of their hands<br />\nwill bring harmony and peace<br />\nin a world we pray may be at peace.<br />\n<em>Amen</em>.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<p>This prayer of the guest chaplain was offered in the fifth month of the second session of the 95th US Congress in the House of Representatives, and published in the <em>Congressional Record</em>, vol. 124, part 11 (17 May 1978), page 14095. </p>\n<h3>Source(s)</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_55793\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Congressional-Record-vol--124-part-11-17-May-1978-p--14095.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-55793\" src=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Congressional-Record-vol--124-part-11-17-May-1978-p--14095-250x250.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-55793\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-55793\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Congressional Record, vol. 124, part 11 (17 May 1978), p. 14095</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
