He earned his bachelor’s degree at the University of New York, Buffalo, and his Reform rabbinic ordination from Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in Cincinnati in 1970. Rabbi Kane served The Temple, Congregation B’nai Jehudah in greater Kansas City in the 1990s as its rabbi educator. After leaving B’nai Jehudah, he became rabbi at Temple Beth El, in Las Cruces in 1998. He retired in 2007 at which time he became rabbi emeritus. In retirement, he was the volunteer theatre and opera reviewer for the Las Cruces Bulletin as his “way of giving back to the community,” which warmly welcomed him in 1998.",

Jeff Bingaman (D-NM)<br />\nDate of Prayer: 10/01/2002</p>\n<p><!-- --></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>One Minute Speech Given in Recognition of the Guest Chaplain:</h3>\n<p>Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment of the Senate&#8217;s time to particularly acknowledge the presence of our guest Chaplain, Gerald Kane, who is the Rabbi of Temple Beth-El in Las Cruces, NM.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Kane was ordained first in Cincinnati in 1970 at the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion. He has served pulpits in Portland, OR, New Orleans, Phoenix, and in Kansas City, before coming to Las Cruces some 3 years ago.</p>\n<p>Las Cruces is the second largest city in my home State of New Mexico, a very vibrant, growing metropolitan area. It is one of only five communities in New Mexico that has a synagogue. It has the third synagogue that was built in our State.</p>\n<p>Our Jewish community has always had a special role in the life of Las Cruces. Three of the mayors of that city have been of the Jewish faith.</p>\n<p>Following the September 11 attacks, Rabbi Kane, together with other religious leaders in Las Cruces, issued a statement of unity and support at the Las Cruces Islamic Center. He has coordinated clergy participation in this year following 9/11, and has worked very hard to bring the community together in that regard.</p>\n<p>We are very proud that he is here. In talking with him this morning, we were at a loss to think when we last had a clergyman from New Mexico as our guest Chaplain in the Senate. But it is entirely appropriate that we do today.</p>\n<p>I am very honored that Rabbi Kane was able to be with us.</p>\n<p>Also, I wish to acknowledge the presence of his wife Cyrille, who is here with him. They have four children and nine grandchildren.</p>\n<p>Let me also acknowledge the very good work of one of the staff people who works with me, Jeff Steinborn, who works in our Las Cruces office and who helped make the arrangements today for Rabbi Kane to be here.\n</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<hr />\n\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable toggleable-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"x\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"/translate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contribute a translation</a></th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Source (English)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\">\n<h3>Opening Prayer Given by the Guest Chaplain:</h3>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\">\nIn these most challenging of times,<br />\nmay this parable from Jewish tradition<br />\nprovide inspiration and guidance to you,<br />\nthe distinguished Senators<br />\nof our wonder-filled country.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\">\nA man,<br />\nwandering lost in a dark forest for several days,<br />\nfinally encounters another.<br />\nHe calls out:<br />\n&#8220;Brother, show me the way out of here.&#8221;\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\">\nThe man replies:<br />\n&#8220;Brother, I too am lost.<br />\nI can only tell you this:<br />\nthe paths I have tried to get out of this forest<br />\nhave led me nowhere.<br />\nThey have only led me astray.<br />\nHere, take hold of my hand,<br />\nand let us search for a way out of this dark place<br />\ntogether.&#8221;\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\">\n&#8220;And so it is with us,&#8221;<br />\nthe author of the parable concludes.<br />\n&#8220;When we go our separate ways,<br />\nwe may go astray.<br />\nLet us join hands<br />\nand look for the path<br />\nout of the darkness<br />\ntogether.&#8221;<span class=\"footnote_referrer\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_1');\" onkeypress=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_1');\" ><sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_1\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\">[1]</sup></a><span id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_1\" class=\"footnote_tooltip\"> This parable is derived from a famous story relayed by the ḥassidic rebbe of Tzantz, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaim_Halberstam\">Ḥayyim Halberstam</a> (1793–1876).
