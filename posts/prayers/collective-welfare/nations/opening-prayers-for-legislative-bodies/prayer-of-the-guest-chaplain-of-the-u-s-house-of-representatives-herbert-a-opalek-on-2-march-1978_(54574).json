            "bio": "Herbert Alan Opalek (1944-2011) was born in Brooklyn, New York, and for much of his life, identified himself as an orthodox rabbi. He received his semikhah around the year 1962. In the early 1970s, he appears to have been a fellow at Dropsie College Philadelphia, studying <a href=\"https://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/psco/archives/psco08-min.htm#Set5\">Christian-Jewish relations</a> in Antiquity. In 1978, Rep. Leo Zeferetti (D-NY) introduced him before the US House of Representatives as a colleague and \"executive vice president for Yeshivos Zichron Pinchos for boys and Kesser Malka for girls\" in Brooklyn. In 1986, the Washington (DC) Board of Rabbis issued a formal letter about his involvement in a scam. In 1987, he was reported by the <a href=\"https://ohiomemory.org/digital/collection/ojc/id/41386/\">Jewish Telegraphic Agency</a> to have been swindling people for apartment rent and event tickets. Around the year 2000, a story is told of his conversion to Christianity, after which he was ordained as a Christian (Baptist) pastor and served as a consultant to Messianic Jewish-Christians. His obituary notes that he was active in the Evangelical Covenant Church of America, and that he was the CEO of Merced County (California) Rescue Mission, the president of the Pacific District of the Association of Gospel Rescue Missions, and the board president of Rescue Israel Ministries. The obituary also claims that he was the recipient of multiple doctoral degrees (possibly from his time at Dropsie College) and that he served as a consultant to the U.S. House of Representative's Select Committee on Drug and Alcohol Abuse. In the year following his death, two prayerbooks, both for Messianic Jewish-Christians, were published in his name: <em>Sabbath Delights: A Messianic Shabbat Siddur</em> and <em>Celebrating Yeshua in the Fall Holidays: Messianic Festivals Siddur</em>.

Zeferetti (D-NY)<br />\nDate of Prayer: 2 March 1978</p>\n<p><!-- --></p>\n<blockquote><p>\nMr. ZEFERETTI. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to welcome today on behalf of my colleagues, Rabbi Herbert A. Opalek, executive vice president of Yeshivos Zichron Pinchos for boys and Kesser Malka for girls. Although still young, Rabbi Opalek has served the Jewish and general community at large as spiritual leader and university professor. As a scholar of note the rabbi has contributed much to the understanding of the Talmudic period, as well as legal studies of rabbinic jurisprudence.</p>\n<p>At present, Rabbi Opalek serves as executive vice president to one of the fastest growing Judaic and rabbinic schools in the Greater New York area. Under spiritual and active leadership of my good friend, Rabbi David S. Helberg, Zichron Pinchos and Kesser Malka which is located in my district has achieved a high level of educational excellence. This school of learning is comprised of nursery, elementary, and rabbinic divisions. Rabbis Opalek and Helberg are active in community affairs and the yeshiva serves as a center for the dissemination of social service and community information.</p>\n<p>There can be no doubt that this yeshiva is indeed a credit to its community. I know that my colleagues join me in saluting this outstanding religious and civic leader on this milestone of his life I am enormously proud to count Rabbi Opalek as both a constituent and a friend.\n</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<hr />\n\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable toggleable-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"x\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a
