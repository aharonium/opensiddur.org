Lindy Boggs (D-LA)</p>\n<blockquote><p> Sen. Boggs: Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer my expression of gratitude to Rabbi Edward Paul Cohn, for the beautiful prayer with which he has opened our session today. Rabbi Cohn, born in Baltimore, received his B.A. degree from the University of Cincinnati, his master&#8217;s from Hebrew Union College and his doctorate from the St. Paul School of Theology. He has served in Atlanta, Macon, Georgia, Kansas City, Missouri, and in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. </p>\n<p>In 1987 he came to us in New Orleans as rabbi of the prestigious Temple Sinai to lead a congregation with a long and distinguished history of service to our city and our State. </p>\n<p>This year is one of special preparation for the auspicious celebration of Temple Sinai&#8217;s 120th anniversary, the length of days of Moses&#8217; life and worthy of the comparison. </p>\n<p>Steeped in the tradition of significant leadership carried forward in recent years by my good friends the late Rabbi Julian Leibelman and Rabbi Murray Blackman, Temple Sinai is fortunate to have Dr. Cohn as rabbi at this precious moment in its history. </p>\n<p>Rabbi Cohn is married to the lovely former Andrea Levy and they have two daughters, Jennifer and Debra. </p>\n<p>We regret that they are not with us today, but we are pleased to have with us the presence of Dr. Cohn&#8217;s parents, Rebecca Weiner Cohn and Rudolph J. Cohn, who are celebrating a very special wedding anniversary, and his aunt and uncle, Gertrude Weiner and Ben Weiner. </p>\n<p>Welcome, and thank you, Dr. Cohn.\n</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable toggleable-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"x\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"/contributing/upload/\">Contribute&nbsp;a&nbsp;translation</a></th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Source (English)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nWe pray in the words of the Psalmist:<br />\n<em>Zeh Hayom Asah Adonai<br />\nNagilah V&#8217;nism&#8217;cha Vo!</em><br />\nThis is the day which the Lord has made,<br />\nlet us rejoice and be glad in it.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nHeavenly Father,<br />\nin these soul-stir-ring times, O Lord,<br />\nwhen from one comer of the world to the other,<br />\nthe hope of liberty<br />\nand the hunger for freedom<br />\nare being proclaimed and celebrated,<br />\nlet us give great thanks<br />\nfor the privilege which is ours<br />\nto live in this day and age.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nBless Thou,<br />\nthe people of this glorious land of liberty and democracy;<br />\nall of our Nation&#8217;s leaders,<br />\nand each one of the Representatives<br />\nwho serve in this distinguished House.<br />\nMay they successfully labor to address<br />\nthe pressing and complex issues of our times<br />\nwith insight,<br />\nwith compassion,<br />\nand with wisdom.<br />\nFor the blessing of all<br />\nand for the hurt of none;<br />\nFor the abundance of all<br />\nand for the scarcity of none;<br />\nFor the life of all<br />\nand for the distress of none.<br />\n<em>Amen</em>.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<h3>Source(s)</h3>\n<p>101st Congress, 1st Session. <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4503411/rabbi-edward-paul-cohn-temple-israel-orleans-la\">C-SPAN</a>.<br />\n<em>Congressional Record</em>, <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/101/crecb/1989/09/13/GPO-CRECB-1989-pt15-1-2.pdf\">Vol. 135, Part 15 — Bound Edition, p. 20325</a>.</p>\n<p><iframe width=530 height=312 src='https://www.c-span.org/video/standalone/?c4503411/rabbi-edward-paul-cohn-temple-israel-orleans-la' allowfullscreen='allowfullscreen' frameborder=0></iframe><span class=\"\" style=\"display:block;clear:both;height: 0px;border-top-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;\"></span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_47671\" style=\"width: 225px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Congressional-Record-v.-135-part-15-13-September-1989.-p.-20325.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-47671\" src=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Congressional-Record-v.-135-part-15-13-September-1989.-p.-20325-215x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"215\" height=\"300\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-47671\" srcset=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Congressional-Record-v.-135-part-15-13-September-1989.-p.-20325-215x300.png 215w, https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Congressional-Record-v.-135-part-15-13-September-1989.-p.-20325-733x1024.png 733w, https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Congressional-Record-v.-135-part-15-13-September-1989.-p.-20325.png 1170w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-47671\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Congressional Record v. 135, part 15 &#8211; 13 September 1989. p. 20325</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
