    "content": "<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\" style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">\nGuest Chaplain: Rabbi Eugene H. Levy, Congregation Beth El, Tyler, Texas<br />\nSponsor: Rep. Jonas Martin Frost Ⅲ (D-TX)<br />\nDate of Prayer: 24 June 1982</p>\n<p><!-- --></p>\n<blockquote><p>\nThe SPEAKER. The Chair wishes to inform the Members that our visiting Chaplain this morning is the cousin of the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. Frost).</p>\n<p>The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.</p>\n<p>Mr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to introduce my cousin and good friend, Rabbi Eugene Levy, who served as our guest chaplain today.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Levy is with the Temple Beth El in Tyler, Texas, and was formerly the director of the Hillel Foundation at the University of Oklahoma at Norman. He is a graduate of the University of Texas and of the Hebrew Union College of Cincinnati where he received his rabbinical degree.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Levy grew up in San Antonio, Texas, where as a young man, he served as the president of the Texas-Oklahoma Federation of Temple Youth. Now living in Tyler with his wife, Bobbi, and their two children, Rabbi Levy has continued his active involvement in Tyler’s civic affairs.</p>\n<p>Because he has been my close friend for so many years, I take extra pride in introducing him to my friends and colleagues in the House.</p>\n<p>Mr. GONZALEZ. Mr. Speaker, I follow my distinguished associate and colleague from the Dallas area, Congressman Frost, in welcoming Rabbi Levy, who gave us and offered the prayer as the guest chaplain.</p>\n<p>Because of the fact that this distinguished family, both the Frost family as well the Levy family and their immediate forebears, have played a very important role in the development of the district I have the honor of representing, the city of San Antonio, culturally, socially, economically, the names Frost, Cohen, and Levy are outstanding.</p>\n<p>In my own family, when my parents came from Mexico in the category of refugees, actually, and in the early dim years of my childhood, the earliest memory I have is accompanying my mother and my aunt to English and citizenship class instruction offered by the Jewish Federation of Women, the only organization anywhere that took any interest in trying to help the immigrant group. At that time the U.S. Immigration officials did everything they could to prevent people like my relatives from becoming citizens. The Frost family was in the forefront of the efforts of the San Antonio Federation of Jewish Women, who had their headquarters on Poplar Street and where English and citizenship instructions were imparted.\n</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<hr />\n\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable toggleable-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"x\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"/translate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contribute&nbsp;a&nbsp;translation</a></th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Source (English)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nOur <span class=\"divine-referent\">God</span> and <span class=\"divine-referent\">Creator</span>,<br />\nwe, gathered here this morning,<br />\nthank You for implanting the idea<br />\nof justice and righteousness<br />\nwithin us.<br />\nWe ask You to be with us<br />\nas we attempt to express these ideas<br />\nin our lives.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nHelp each of us<br />\nto determine Your will for us.<br />\nIn so doing, inspire us<br />\nto search our various traditions—<br />\nextracting from them the shared love<br />\nfor our fellow brothers and sisters here,<br />\nand around the world.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nKindle within each of us<br />\nthe passion for righteousness<br />\nand peace.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nMay we be open<br />\nto the thoughts and beliefs<br />\nof others.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nAnd may we—<br />\nby our thoughts and actions—<br />\nhasten the time when corruption and evil will cease,<br />\nand justice will be established<br />\nin all the Earth.<br />\n<em>Amen</em>.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<p>This prayer of the guest chaplain was offered in the sixth month of the second session of the 97th US House of Representatives, and published in the <em>Congressional Record</em>, vol. 128 part 11 (24 June 1982), page 15148. </p>\n<h3>Source(s)</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_56849\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Congressional-Record-vol--128-part-11-24-June-1982-p--15148_Page_1.png\" rel=\"lightbox-0\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-56849\" src=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Congressional-Record-vol--128-part-11-24-June-1982-p--15148_Page_1-250x250.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-56849\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-56849\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Congressional Record, vol. 128, part 11 (24 June 1982), p. 15148_Page_1</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
