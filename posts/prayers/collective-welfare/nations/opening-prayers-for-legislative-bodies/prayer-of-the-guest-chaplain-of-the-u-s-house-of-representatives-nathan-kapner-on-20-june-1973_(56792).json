Angelo D. Roncallo (R-NY)<br />\nDate of Prayer: 20 June 1973</p>\n<p><!-- --></p>\n<blockquote><p>\nMr. RONCALLO of New York, Mr. Speaker, I am proud that our opening prayer in the House of Representatives was delivered by Rabbi Nathan Kapner, the spiritual leader of the Hillel Hebrew Academy and Synagogue of Massapequa, my hometown. It is indeed an honor for all the residents of the Third Congressional District on Long Island to have Rabbi Kapner here. He is the first clergyman from my new district to deliver the House opening prayer and I am proud that he was invited to do so.</p>\n<p>It is most appropriate that Rabbi Kapner is with us today for, this evening, in my district, Jew and non-Jew alike are to march to the Russian mission estate in Glen Cove to protest the plight of Soviet Jewry.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Kapner has long been concerned with the well-being of his Jewish brethren. Among his many outstanding accomplishments is his work with many blind Jewish youth in our community. With the assistance of braille prayer books and texts, Rabbi Kapner has helped these young people to become educated and fulfilled members of the Jewish community so that they can take full part in the traditional services of the synagogue and be knowledgeable of their traditions and history.</p>\n<p>On behalf of my constituents and colleagues, I thank Rabbi Kapner for being with us today.\n</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<hr />\n\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable toggleable-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"x\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"/translate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contribute&nbsp;a&nbsp;translation</a></th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Source (English)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nO <span class=\"divine-referent\">Lord</span>,<br />\nbe Thou with this assembly of legislators<br />\nwho have been selected<br />\nto guide the destinies<br />\nof our great Nation.<br />\nHumbly we ask Thy blessings<br />\nto grant them good health and strength<br />\nso that these honored lawmakers<br />\nbe sparked with God’s divineness<br />\nand inspired to translate into law<br />\nthe Biblical moral and ethical ideals<br />\nlaid down by our ancestors:<br />\nThe hatred of tyranny<br />\nand the love of freedom—<br />\nthe very foundation of our democracy.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nPermit us to be sensitive<br />\nto our aged,<br />\nto the handicapped,<br />\nand to the destitute in our midst.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nWe pray that our Republic<br />\nuphold the reverence for all humanity<br />\nin every land<br />\nand continue to build a society<br />\nbased on love and compassion<br />\nand the dignity of man.<br />\n<em>Amen</em>.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<p>This prayer of the guest chaplain was offered in the sixth month of the first session of the 93rd US House of Representatives, and published in the <em>Congressional Record</em>, vol. 119, part 16 (20 June 1973), page 20513. </p>\n<h3>Source(s)</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_56794\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Congressional-Record-vol--119-part-16-20-June-1973-p--20513.png\" rel=\"lightbox-0\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-56794\" src=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Congressional-Record-vol--119-part-16-20-June-1973-p--20513-250x250.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-56794\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-56794\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Congressional Record, vol. 119, part 16 (20 June 1973), p. 20513</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
