Mr. Speaker, I am honored today to be able to recognize Rabbi Dov Edelstein, who delivered our opening prayer this morning.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Edelstein has served for 9 years at the Moses Montefiore Synagogue in my hometown—Appleton, Wisconsin. He is well known in Appleton as an exemplary citizen with an outstanding reputation for community service.</p>\n<p>The Rabbi is a native of Romania, and was ordained to the rabbinate in Hungary in 1944. He is also a former inmate of the Nazi concentration camp at Auschwitz. Following the war, he was one of the 50,000 Jews interned by the British in camps on Cyprus prior to the establishment of the State of Israel.</p>\n<p>From 1947 to 1962, he lived in Israel and taught Hebrew at several institutions and also taught the language to immigrants. In 1962 he entered the United States and settled in Weirton, West Virginia, the sight of his first congregation, coming from there to Appleton 9 years ago.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Edelstein holds a graduate degree in American history and is the author of a major study of the relationship of the Wisconsin press toward President Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War.</p>\n<p>It is certainly a pleasure and an honor to welcome him here today.\n</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<hr />\n\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable toggleable-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"x\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"/translate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contribute&nbsp;a&nbsp;translation</a></th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Source (English)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<span class=\"divine-referent\">Ever living God</span>:<br />\nIn these trying times<br />\nof confusion and perplexity,<br />\nwe are looking to Thee<br />\nfor guidance<br />\nand sustenance.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nWe pray and grasp for peace<br />\nand for harmonious relations<br />\namong all Thy children;<br />\nyet, there are detractors<br />\nwho despise these lofty aims<br />\nand hinder their realization<br />\namong mankind.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nGive us, O <span class=\"divine-referent\">Lord</span>,<br />\nstrength and encouragement<br />\nthat we may not falter.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nBestow Thy guidance<br />\nand inspiration<br />\nupon the elect representatives<br />\nof this American Nation<br />\nthat they discharge<br />\ntheir heavy responsibilities<br />\nwith prudence,<br />\ncourage,<br />\nand humility.<br />\nMay they navigate the ship of our Nation<br />\nin the turbulent waters<br />\nto secure and tranquil havens.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nDo Thou crown with success<br />\nthe efforts of the President of the United States<br />\nat establishing lasting peace among the nations<br />\nin the Middle East.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nImbue, O <span class=\"divine-referent\">Lord</span>,<br />\nthe hearts of all Thy children<br />\nwith the precious gift of peace<br />\nas an everlasting blessing for us,<br />\nand for Thy eternal glory.<br />\n<em>Amen</em>.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<p>This prayer of the guest chaplain was offered in the second month of the second session of the 96th US Congress in the House of Representatives, and published in the <em>Congressional Record</em>, vol. 125, part 4 (1979), page 4472.
