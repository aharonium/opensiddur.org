Bill Lehman (D-FL)<br />\nDate of Prayer: 22 October 1985</p>\n<p><!-- --></p>\n<blockquote><p>\nMr. LEHMAN. Mr. Speaker, Rabbi Simcha Freedman was born in Philadelphia, Pa. He graduated Yeshiva University. He was ordained by the Rabbi Isaac Hanen Theological Seminary in 1962 and received a master&#8217;s degree in Hebrew literature from the Bernard Revei graduate school that same year.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Simcha Freedman has served congregations in Shenandoah, Pa., and Philadelphia. He is currently spiritual Jeader of Temple Adath Yeshurun in North Miami Beach, Fla. Rabbi Freedman is a past president of the Philadelphia branch of the Rabbinical Council of America, and is a past secretary of the board of rabbis of Greater Philadelphia.</p>\n<p>He now serves as secretary of the Rabbinical Association of Greater Miami and serves on the City Advisory Council of the Planning Commission of North Miami Beach. He has contributed articles to various local and national publications.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Freedman is married to the former Anna Becher Wasser and they have two children, Sammy and Benjy. During the years that I have known Rabbi Freedman personally and been acquainted with the extent of his community involvement, I have been impressed by not only his active commitments to Jewish causes but also his concern for the well-being of our entire religious and secular community. Rabbi Freedman is a great humanitarian as well as a true spiritual leader.\n</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<hr />\n\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable
