Wagner, Beth ha-Medrosh Hagodol Congregation, Denver, Colorado<br />\nSponsor: Rep. Pat Schroeder (D-CO)<br />\nDate of Prayer: 2 April 1984</p>\n<p><!-- --></p>\n<blockquote><p>\nMrs. SCHROEDER. Mr. Speaker, Dr. Stanley M. Wagner is rabbi of the Beth ha-Medrosh Hagodol (B.M.H.) congregation in Denver, Colorado, and professor of Judaic studies and director of the Center for Judaic Studies at the University of Denver. He also serves as chaplain of the Colorado State Senate, the first and only rabbi ever appointed to that position, and as director of Colorado’s Mizel Museum of Judaica.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Wagner is a religious leader of national renown who came to Denver in September 1972, after serving for two years as national executive vice president of the Religious Zionists of America, a role which catapulted him to key positions on the national and international Jewish scene, in such organizations as the American Zionist Organization, Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations, and the American Conference for Soviet Jewry. In 1979, Rabbi Wagner was awarded “Life Tenure” by his congregation “in recognition of his significant contributions to Jewish life and to the community.”</p>\n<p>Ordained at the Yeshiva University’s Rabbinical Seminary, Rabbi Wagner holds five other degrees of higher learning from this institution, including a doctorate in Jewish history. He served as an instructor for 4 years in the Department of Ancient Languages and Literatures at the University of Kentucky while holding a pulpit in Lexington, and was appointed instructor in history at Hofstra University in New York serving as rabbi of the Baldwin Jewish Center in Long Island. He has delivered a number of scholarly papers at conferences of the American Association of Professors of Hebrew, the Society of Biblical Literature and Exegesis, the National Foreign Language Conference, and the Congress on Science and Ethics, and he has spoken as guest lecturer and “Scholar In Residence” in communities from coast to coast.</p>\n<p>Dr. Wagner has been cited by the Bonds of Israel, United Jewish Appeal, Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, Jewish National Fund, ORT, and Yeshiva University, and he was the recipient of the Shofar Award from the Boy Scouts of America. He is listed in <em>Who&#8217;s Who in World Jewry</em> (1972), <em>Who&#8217;s Who in Religion</em> (1977), and <em>Who&#8217;s Who in American Jewry</em> (1980). He served as president of the Long Island Commission of Orthodox Rabbis and the Nassau-Suffolk Association of Rabbis, vice president of the Rabbinic Alumni of Yeshiva University, chairman of the Rabbinic Advisory Council of the Jewish National Fund, panelist in the American Arbitration Association, director of the Judaic Program at Camp B’nai B&#8217;rith, resident scholar for seven summers at B’nai B&#8217;rith Youth&#8217;s International Leadership Trainee program, and he currently serves as a member of the National Adult Jewish Education Commission of B’nai B&#8217;rith.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Wagner is one of the few clergymen in America to have delivered invocations both at the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. Dr. Wagner has written scholarly and popular articles in publications such as <em>Congress Bi-Weekly</em>, in <em>Jewish Bookland</em>, <em>National Jewish Monthly</em>, the <em>Synagogue Light</em>, and has had many of his sermons selected as the “year’s best” and published by the Rabbinical Council of America. He has edited or written four significant volumes entitled <em>Great Confrontations in Jewish History</em>, <em>Traditions of the American Jew</em>, and <em>Great Schisms in Jewish History</em>, published by the University of Denver, and <em>A Piece of My Mind</em>, published by KTAV. President Jimmy Carter invited the rabbi to the White House in March 1978, to present <em>Traditions of the American Jew</em> to him, personally. Dr. Wagner is also general editor of a three-volume series on <em>Christian and Jewish Traditions in the 20th Century</em> to be published by Abingdon Press. The first volume, entitled <em>Scripture—Its Authority, Interpretation, and Relevance</em> appeared in September 1982. Rabbi Wagner has traveled extensively and has been to Israel 12 times or Government study grants and as leader of pilgrimages. In 1976, Dr. Wagner was sent on a mission to Russia where he met with the leaders of the Jewish communities in Moscow, Kiev, and Leningrad.\n</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<hr />\n\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable toggleable-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"x\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"/translate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contribute&nbsp;a&nbsp;translation</a></th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Source (English)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<span class=\"divine-referent\">Our God</span> and <span class=\"divine-referent\">God of our Fathers</span>:<br />\nWith grateful hearts<br />\nfor the privilege<br />\nof meeting together<br />\nas free men<br />\nin a free land,<br />\ndo we invoke Thy blessings<br />\nupon this gathering<br />\nof the distinguished leaders<br />\nof our country.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<span class=\"divine-referent\">Heavenly Father</span>,<br />\nshed Thy light of wisdom and understanding<br />\nupon their deliberations.<br />\nBless them with good health,<br />\ndiscernment, and vision,<br />\nthereby enabling them to cope successfully<br />\nwith the manifold problems<br />\nwith which they are confronted.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nBless Thou<br />\nour glorious land of liberty<br />\nand our citizens everywhere.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nMay the United States of America<br />\nunder <span class=\"divine-referent\">God</span><br />\nremain a citadel of freedom<br />\nand a watchtower<br />\nfrom which rays of light and hope<br />\nshall be beamed to those<br />\nwho are now living<br />\nin darkness and despair.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nHasten the day<br />\nwhen the millennial hope of universal peace<br />\nwill prevail throughout the world<br />\nwith justice and freedom<br />\nfor all people.<br />\n<em>Amen</em>.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<p>This prayer of the guest chaplain was offered in the third month of the second session of the 98th US Congress in the House of Representatives, and published in the <em>Congressional Record</em>, vol. 130, part 6 (1984), page 7279. </p>\n<h3>Source(s)</h3>\n<p><span style=\"float: right;\"><div id=\"attachment_55163\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Congressional-Record-vol--130-part-6-2-April-1984-p--7279.png\" rel=\"lightbox-0\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-55163\" src=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Congressional-Record-vol--130-part-6-2-April-1984-p--7279-250x250.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-55163\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-55163\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Congressional Record, vol. 130, part 6 (2 April 1984), p. 7279</p></div></span> <span style=\"float: left;\"><div id=\"attachment_55164\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Congressional-Record-vol--130-part-6-2-April-1984-p--7280.png\" rel=\"lightbox-1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-55164\" src=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Congressional-Record-vol--130-part-6-2-April-1984-p--7280-250x250.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-55164\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-55164\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Congressional Record, vol. 130, part 6 (2 April 1984), p. 7280</p></div></span><span class=\"\" style=\"display:block;clear:both;height: 0px;border-top-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;\"></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
