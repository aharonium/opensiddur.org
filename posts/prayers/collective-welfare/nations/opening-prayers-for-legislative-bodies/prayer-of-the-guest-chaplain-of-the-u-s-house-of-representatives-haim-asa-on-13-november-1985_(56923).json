Mr. Speaker, I have the very great honor today of representing Rabbi Haim Asa, of Fullerton, CA, who gave the invocation.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Asa was born in Bulgaria and emigrated to Palestine in 1944, living there for 10 years. In 1954 he came to the United States to study agricultural economics at the University of Arizona. Soon thereafter, he decided to enter rabbinic studies and attended the Hebrew Union College Jewish Studies Institute.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Asa served for 3 years as director of the World Union for Progressive Judaism for South America in Argentina. He is a past president of the Jewish Federal Council and a past president of the Fullerton Ministerial Association.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Asa and his wife have four children. They have lived in Fullerton since 1963, where he serves at Temple Beth Tikvah.</p>\n<p>My wife and I, with Denny Smith and his lovely wife, Kathleen, had the distinct pleasure of traveling to Israel earlier this year with Rabbi Asa, where he offered keen insight and observation on that historical land.</p>\n<p>I am indeed very pleased to present Rabbi Haim Asa to the House today.</p>\n<p>Mr. DENNY SMITH. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?</p>\n<p>Mr. DANNEMEYER. I yield to the gentleman from Oregon [Mr. Denny Smith).</p>\n<p>Mr. DENNY SMITH. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</p>\n<p>It is my distinct pleasure to have Rabbi Asa here today. The gentleman from California [Mr. DANNEMEYER] and his wife and my wife toured Israel with him last April, and we had a tremendous time with a tremendous individual, and it is a real pleasure to have him here in the House today as the visiting chaplain.\n</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<hr />\n\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable toggleable-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"x\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"/translate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contribute&nbsp;a&nbsp;translation</a></th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Source (English)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<span class=\"divine-referent\">Our God</span>, <span class=\"divine-referent\">the Lord of all mankind</span>:<br />\nIt is our prayer that Your blessings<br />\nof wisdom and courage<br />\ncome upon this assembly,<br />\nupon our Government and our Nation.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nThe eyes of all of Your children<br />\nare focused upon the forthcoming summit.<span class=\"footnote_referrer\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_1');\" onkeypress=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_1');\" ><sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_1\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\">[1]</sup></a><span id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_1\" class=\"footnote_tooltip\"> This was the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Summit_(1985)\">Geneva Summit</a> of 1985, a Cold War-era meeting in Geneva, Switzerland.
