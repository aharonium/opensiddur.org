            "bio": "Rabbi Abraham Chill (March 30, 1912 – April 20, 2004), born in New York, was an Orthodox rabbi in the United States and the first rabbi at the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York. He attended Yeshiva University and the City College of New York. In 1935, he received his rabbinic ordination from Chief Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook in Jerusalem and from the Lomza Yeshiva in Petach Tikvah, Israel. In 1941, immediately after the attack on Pearl Harbor, he enlisted in the United States Army. In 1945, after holding pre-war pulpits in Newburgh, New York, and Nashville, Tennessee, he became rabbi of Congregation Sons of Abraham in Providence, Rhode Island, a position he held until his retirement in 1969. In 1946, he was National Chaplain of the Jewish War Veterans of the US, as well as National Chaplain of the American Legion in 1948. He was an active member of the Rabbinical Council of America, serving as president of the North-Eastern Region, and later as national secretary of the Council. He was also a 32nd Degree Mason and a Shriner. Rabbi Chill authored <em>The Mitzvot: The Commandments and Their Rationale</em> (1974), <em>The Minahagim: the customs and ceremonies of Judaism, their origins and rationale</em> (1979), <em>The Sidrot: Insights into the Weekly Torah Reading</em> (1983), and <em>Abarbanel on Pirke Avot</em> (1991).",
