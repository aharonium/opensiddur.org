Mr. Speaker, our guest chaplain today is a distinguished Brooklynite, and the following release issued by him is quite interesting:</p>\n<p>A refugee from Dachau had his dream come true today when he stood before the opening of the U.S. House of Representatives delivering his invocation as a clergyman of the Jewish faith.</p>\n<p>It is Congressman Eugene J. Keogh, Democrat, of Brooklyn, who was instrumental in inviting Rabbi Sidney Harcsztark, a prominent figure in the field of Jewish education in New York, to open the session of the House with a prayer.</p>\n<p>Serving as administrator of Yeshiva Rambam, a progressive Jewish orthodox all-day school in Brooklyn, New York, Rabbi Harcsztark is a descendant of a prominent rabbinic family in pre-war Poland and was actively engaged in many religious and humanitarian activities in the ghetto of Lodz, Poland. Prior to his arrival in the United States, Rabbi Harcsztark was affiliated with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration serving the UNRRA team 503, in Zeilsheim, Germany.\n</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable toggleable-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"x\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a
