He is very active in community and civic affairs in addition to his role as religious leader to the Rodef Shalom Congregation.</p>\n<p>A graduate of the State University of New York at Buffalo, Rabbi Segel received his master of arts in Hebrew letters from Hebrew Union.</p>\n<p>He serves on numerous committees and commissions including: Planned Parenthood of Allegheny County; Allegheny County Concerned Clergymen’s Committee; Recognize All Potential— RAP; Clergymen Action Committee for Neighborhood Cooperation, and others.</p>\n<p>The rabbi was accompanied to Washington today by his wife,
