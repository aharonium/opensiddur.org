            "bio": "Rabbi Max B. (Meir) Wall (1915-2009), born in Poland, was a Conservative movement rabbi in the United States. His family emigrated to America in 1921 and lived in Denver, Colorado until 1927, when the family relocated to the Lower East Side of Manhattan in New York City. He received an AB from Yeshiva University, and his semikhah from the Jewish Theological Seminary. After taking a pulpit in Woodbury, New Jersey for a year, he enlisted in the Army Chaplain Corps and served with the Ninth Infantry Division during the Battle of the Bulge and took part in the liberation of the concentration camps. As the Jewish chaplain he was able to help thousands of displaced persons. Captain Wall was instrumental in the revival of Jewish worship in Munich and was the first to conduct a Jewish service there after the war. After returning from Europe in 1946, Rabbi Wall and his family moved to Burlington, Vermont where he served Ohavi Zedek Synagogue from 1946 until his retirement in 1987. He was one of the founders of the Burlington Ecumenical Action Ministry (BEAM) and joined the faculty of St. Michael's College where he taught Jewish related classes from 1964-1993. He also taught Religion and Ethics at Champlain College, and guest lectured at UVM and Norwich University. Rabbi Wall was a moral educator and activist with an enduring commitment to social justice, advocacy for human rights and a tireless effort to improve the social well being of all peoples. He served as the Jewish Chaplain for the State Institutions from 1946-1993, visiting the Brandon School, Waterbury State Hospital, and Vermont prisons. He served on the boards of the Medical Center Hospital of Vermont, Champlain College, and Howard Mental Health, where he was the chair of the Psychiatric Disabilities Committee. He served on the Governor's Advisory Committee on bio-medical ethics, the Governor's Committee on Youth, the Committee on Employment of the Handicapped, and the Vermont State Housing Authority. Rabbi Wall was awarded honorary doctorates from the Jewish Theological Seminary, University of Vermont and St. Michael's College. He received a Commissioner's Award from the Vermont Agency of Human Services in 1994, and many other honors. The Rabbi was a member of the Rotary Club and a Chaplain Emeritus of the Masons. He belonged to several Veterans' groups, and numerous Jewish organizations. He served on the Executive Board of the Rabbinical Assembly of America and the New York Board of Rabbis.",

Patrick Leahy (D-VT)<br />\nDate of Prayer: 21 June 1984</p>\n<p><!-- --></p>\n<blockquote><p>\nMr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to note that it is a proud day for me as it is for all Vermonters to have Rabbi Max Wall open this august body with a prayer. All Vermonters, of all religious faiths, have turned to Rabbi Wall for decades for spiritual leadership. He is a close and dear and beloved friend of the Leahy family. He is a man to whom I have, throughout my career in public life, turned for help and guidance and spiritual leadership. I hope that we, as a Senate, will take heed of what he has said, especially when he said, “Nation shall not lift up sword against nation. Neither shall people learn war any more.”<span class=\"footnote_referrer\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_1');\" onkeypress=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_1');\" ><sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_1\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\">[1]</sup></a><span id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_1\" class=\"footnote_tooltip\"> Isaiah 2:4, Micah 4:3.&nbsp;</span></span><script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery('#footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_1').tooltip({ tip: '#footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_1', tipClass: 'footnote_tooltip', effect: 'fade', predelay: 0, fadeInSpeed: 200, delay: 400, fadeOutSpeed: 200, position: 'center right', relative: true, offset: [0, 0], });</script></p>\n<p>All Americans yearn for peace. Americans know in a nuclear age that peace also requires true arms control. When an arms control treaty is finally negotiated the responsibility for its acceptance will be here in the Senate.</p>\n<p>This is the body. We are the 100 people who will eventually, someday, vote on arms control treaties. At that time, I shall repeat again what Rabbi Wall has told us today.</p>\n<p>I thank my good friend for praying with the Senate today and seeking the blessings of our God. Shalom.</p>\n<p>I yield back my time.</p>\n<p>Mr. BAKER. I yield 1 minute to the senior Senator from Vermont.</p>\n<p>Mr. STAFFORD. I thank the majority leader.</p>\n<p>Mr. President, I share in the pride Senator Leahy has expressed and the sentiments he has expressed for the most distinguished member of the clergy from Burlington, VT, Max Wall. I have known Rabbi Wall ever since I came into State affairs and I shall not mention for him or for me how long that is, but it covers a considerable period of time. As Senator Leahy and all Vermonters, I have looked up to Rabbi Wall as one of the cultural and spiritual leaders of Burlington and the entire State and one of the true community leaders in the broadest meaning of that term in Burlington, Vermont.</p>\n<p>I am very proud that he is here representing Vermont spiritually.\n</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<hr />\n\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable toggleable-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"x\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"/translate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contribute&nbsp;a&nbsp;translation</a></th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Source (English)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<span class=\"divine-referent\">Our God</span> and <span class=\"divine-referent\">God of our ancestors</span>.<br />\nBy Thy will<br />\nthe planets in the universe<br />\nwhisper of Your glory<br />\nand the amoeba came into being.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nYou have put us into a universe<br />\nreplete with mystery and power<br />\nbeyond compare.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nFrom the smallest of Your planets<br />\nYou took some dust,<br />\ntouched it with Your spirit<br />\nand called it Adam.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nA soul You gave us<br />\nand then commanded us<br />\nto have dominion over<br />\nall Your creation.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nWe who have the mandate<br />\nto lead and serve this Nation<br />\npray that our deliberations and decisions<br />\nwill unite all the inhabitants of our country,<br />\nwhatever their origin and creed,<br />\ninto a bond of true brotherhood<br />\nto banish hatred and bigotry,<br />\nand to safeguard the ideals and free institutions<br />\nwhich are our country’s glory.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nMay this land under Thy providence<br />\nbe an influence for good<br />\nthroughout the world,<br />\nuniting people in peace<br />\nand freedom<br />\nand helping to fulfill the vision of Thy prophets:<br />\n“Nation shall not lift up sword against nation,<br />\nneither shall people learn war any more.” <span class=\"citation\">(Isaiah 2:4, Micah 4:3)</span><br />\n<em>Amen</em>.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<p>This prayer of the guest chaplain was offered in the sixth month of the second session of the 98th US Senate, and published in the <em>Congressional Record</em>, vol. 130, part 13 (21 June 1984), page 17731. </p>\n<h3>Source(s)</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_56825\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Congressional-Record-vol--130-part-13-21-June-1984-p--17731.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-56825\" src=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Congressional-Record-vol--130-part-13-21-June-1984-p--17731-250x250.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-56825\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-56825\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Congressional Record, vol. 130, part 13 (21 June 1984), p. 17731</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"speaker-mute footnotes_reference_container\"> <div class=\"footnote_container_prepare\"><p><span role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"footnote_reference_container_label pointer\" onclick=\"footnote_expand_collapse_reference_container__1();\">Notes</span><span role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"footnote_reference_container_collapse_button\" style=\"display: none;;
