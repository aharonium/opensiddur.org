    "content": "<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">\nGuest Chaplain: Rabbi Shmuel M. Butman, director, Lubavitch Youth Organization, Brooklyn, New York<br />\nDate of Prayer: 12 June 1991<br />\nSponsor: Sen. Patrick Moynihan (D-NY)</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nMr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the opening prayer this morning was delivered by Rabbi Shmuel M. Butman of Brooklyn, New York—the director of the Lubavitch Youth Organization.</p>\n<p>Most of the Members of the Senate are familiar with the dynamic work of the Lubavitch movement, which has branches in over 40 States and 100 nations. This extraordinary network of religious, educational, and cultural undertakings is led by an exceptional spiritual leader, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the 7th rabbi of Lubavitch. It is most appropriate that Rabbi Schneerson this week celebrates the 50th anniversary of his arrival in this country.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Schneerson recently entered his 90th year. I know I speak for the entire Senate when I ask Rabbi Butman to convey to him our hearty best wishes for many years of continued inspired leadership.</p>\n<p>I have met with Rabbi Schneerson on several occasions. New Yorkers of all faiths are proud that the world headquarters of Lubavitch is located in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn where it was relocated in 1940 by the current Rebbe&#8217;s venerable predecessor and father-in-law, Rabbi Joseph Schneerson.</p>\n<p>Many Members of the Senate are familiar with the role that a member of this body played in securing the release of Rabbi Joseph Schneerson from a Soviet prison and the emigration of his entire immediate family, including the current Rebbe, from Stalin&#8217;s Russia. The intervention of Senator William Borah of Idaho on behalf of this beleaguered Chassidic family stands as a noble example of courageous moral leadership. All of us in public life would do well to ponder Senator Borah&#8217;s oft-repeated explanation as to his motive in leading an international campaign to save an apparently obscure religious leader in a faraway land, &#8220;I like to do things that get me votes in that final election we will all have to stand for someday.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I thought of Senator Borah last year when I visited Morocco in my capacity as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee&#8217;s Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia.</p>\n<p>When I met with the Jewish leaders of Morocco and toured several of their synagogues and civic centers I discovered two pictures in every building His Majesty King Hassan Ⅱ and the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson.</p>\n<p>This should not surprise anyone who is familiar with the Rebbe&#8217;s historic role in supporting Jewish education and Jewish continuity throughout the world.</p>\n<p>Lubavitch is deeply involved in many nations around the globe where it is the only official Jewish presence and the only source of Jewish educational and religious training. And some day, hopefully soon, the full story will be told of Lubavitch&#8217;s heroic role in keeping Judaism alive in lands of cruel tyranny where teaching the Bible is a crime and uttering a public prayer is rewarded with a prison sentence.</p>\n<p>For forty years these remarkable activities&#8212;the publicized and the clandestine; the Chanukah lamp lighting on television and the underground matzah baking under the noses of Communist secret police, the young women giving out Sabbath candles on 5th Avenue, and the Yeshiva schools in Arab lands&#8212;have been directed and inspired by Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson.</p>\n<p>I would like to welcome his talented disciple Rabbi Shmuel Butman to the Senate and thank him for his moving words of prayer.\n</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<hr />\n\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable toggleable-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"x\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"/translate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contribute a translation</a></th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Source (English)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"33%\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nDear God,<br />\nwith Your bountiful mercy<br />\nwe have just celebrated the 50th anniversary<br />\nof the arrival to these shores<br />\nof the revered leader of world Jewry,<br />\nRabbi Menachem M.
