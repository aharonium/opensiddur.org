Janice Schakowsky, (D-IL)<br />\nDate of Prayer: 05/05/2010</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, Rabbi, I think this is probably the first time that Bill Cosby has been part of the morning prayer. Certainly it is the first time his grandmother has been part of the prayer.</p>\n<p>It is with great pride that I rise to welcome Rabbi Dov Hillel Klein to our Nation&#8217;s Capital as guest chaplain.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Klein works in my hometown of Evanston, Illinois, where he is a widely respected member of the community as the district director of Lubavitch Chabad.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Klein has had a profound impact on Chabad, not only in Evanston, but throughout the United States. He was one of the pioneers in creating Chabad on university campuses in the United States when he brought his ministry to the students at Northwestern University. Because of his continued efforts, today Chabad is on 140 campuses throughout the United States.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Klein also serves an invaluable role in our community as one of the founders and now senior chaplain for the Evanston Police Department, where he accompanies officers in squad cars on patrol and is called upon for crisis intervention. In fact, his work with law enforcement officers around town has earned him the nickname, &#8220;Rabbi Cop.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For all that he has done for our community, I am honored to welcome Rabbi Klein and his sons, Avramy and Levi, who are in the gallery to Congress and to thank him for his wonderful work.\n</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<hr />\n\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable toggleable-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"x\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"/translate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contribute a translation</a></th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Source (English)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\n<h3>Opening Prayer Given by the Guest Chaplain:</h3>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nIn the Jewish tradition, one begins an invocation with words of inspiration.

His grandmother, who did not have a college education or even a high school diploma, responded immediately, &#8220;That&#8217;s so simple.
