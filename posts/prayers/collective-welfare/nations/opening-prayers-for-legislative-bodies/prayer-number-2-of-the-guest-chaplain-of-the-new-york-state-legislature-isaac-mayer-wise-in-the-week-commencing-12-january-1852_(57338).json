one of three opening prayers offered by the guest chaplain, Rabbi Dr. Isaac Mayer Wise, before the Legislature of the State of New York, in the State Assembly (on Tuesday, the 13th of January or Thursday the 15th of January 1852), and in the State Senate (on Monday the 12th, Wednesday the 14th, or Friday the 16th). The prayer was published in <em>The Asmonean</em> (30 January 1852), in a letter dated 20 January from a correspondent identified only under the pseudonym “Bassist.” This prayer is one of two prayers offered in the letter. The body of the letter mentions three prayers, likely indicating that two of the three were given in both the Assembly and the Senate. It is unfortunate that we do not have the third prayer.</p>\n<h3>Source(s)</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_57331\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/letter-from-bassist-20-january-1852-in-correspondence-the-asmonean-30-january-1852-p--9.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-57331\" src=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/letter-from-bassist-20-january-1852-in-correspondence-the-asmonean-30-january-1852-p--9-250x250.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-57331\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-57331\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Letter from &#8220;Bassist,&#8221; 20 January 1852, in Correspondence (The Asmonean, 30 January 1852), p. 9</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
