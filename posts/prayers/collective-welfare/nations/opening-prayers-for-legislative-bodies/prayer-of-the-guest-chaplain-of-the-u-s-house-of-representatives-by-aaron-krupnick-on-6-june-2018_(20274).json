Donald Norcross, (D-NJ)<br />\nDate of Prayer: 06/06/2018</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>One Minute Speech Given in Recognition of the Guest Chaplain:</h3>\n<p>Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to welcome our guest chaplain, Rabbi Aaron Krupnick of Congregation Beth El in Voorhees, New Jersey.</p>\n<p>The congregation has been part of our South Jersey community since 1920, when it was originally founded in Camden City.</p>\n<p>Now it offers a spiritual home for hundreds of Jewish families in South Jersey.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Krupnick came to our community in 1994 from Montgomery, Alabama. There, he helped lead interfaith services with leaders like Martin Luther King, III, and Rosa Parks.</p>\n<p>As you heard in his prayer, he often discusses patience, understanding, kindness, compassion.</p>\n<p>In a world where religion too often creates so much conflict, Rabbi Krupnick focuses on togetherness. He knows there is more that connects us than divides us.</p>\n<p>I have been fortunate enough to attend services and seder at Beth El. I have witnessed firsthand how the community is welcoming, loving, and supportive of all.</p>\n<p>Mr. Speaker, today I am honored to welcome Rabbi Krupnick to the House of Representatives and I thank him for his offering of this morning&#8217;s prayer.</p>\n<p>His compassion, his teachings, his strong leadership have helped foster a vibrant Jewish community in our region, and I know it will stay that way for years to come.\n</p></blockquote>\n<hr />\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto;
