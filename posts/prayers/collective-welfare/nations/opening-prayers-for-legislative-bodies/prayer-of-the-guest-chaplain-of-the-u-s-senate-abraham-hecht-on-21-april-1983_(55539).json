Hecht was a disciple of both the late Lubavitcher Rebbe, Menachem Mendel Schneerson, and the preceding \"sixth\" Rebbe, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn. He was one of the first ten students of Yeshiva Tomchei Tmimim in America. Hecht served as a <em>shaliaḥ</em> (emissary) in Boston, Buffalo, Newark, and New Haven, establishing Yeshiva Achei T'mimim elementary schools for both boys and girls. He served as rabbi of Congregation Shaare Zion of Brooklyn, New York, the largest Syrian-Sephardic congregation in North America, comprising more than 3,500 families. Hecht served the congregation for more than fifty years. On June 19, 1995, Hecht told the gathered members of the International Rabbinical Coalition for Israel \"that by handing over Israeli land and property, Israeli leaders are betraying Jews to non-Jews\" and that, according to Maimonides, \"such people should be killed before they can perform the deed.\" An October 1995 article in New York Magazine referred to Hecht as the rabbi who \"sentenced\" Yitzḥak Rabin to death, and quoted Hecht as praising Israeli mass murderer and American expatriate Baruch Goldstein, as \"a great man, a holy man.\" Hecht also led protests against the film Monty Python's Life of Brian (1979), claiming that it \"was produced in hell.\"",

Mr. President, I want to say a special word of thanks to my friend, Rabbi Abraham Hecht, for his opening prayer at our session today.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Hecht is a wonderful man and a strong community-minded leader. For more than 30 years, he has served the Shaare Zion Congregation on Ocean Parkway, Brooklyn&#8211;a flourishing congregation of more than 10,000 families. He and his wife have their own family of 10 children. It is not surprising that Rabbi Hecht is a great believer in the importance of close and supportive family ties and in the value of family traditions in the raising and education of the younger generation.</p>\n<p>Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am sure the entire Senate would echo the sentiments of the Senator from Washington. We are grateful to the Rabbi for his leading the Senate in prayer as we open this session.</p>\n<p>Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today this Chamber has had the honor· of having Rabbi Abraham B. Hecht, a leader in the American orthodox community offer the opening prayer. Rabbi Hecht is president of the Rabbinical Alliance of America and Rabbi of the largest Syrian Sephardic Congregation in America, Congregation Shaare Zion in Brooklyn, N.Y. He also serves with distinction on the board of governors of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America.</p>\n<p>The Syrian Sephardic community of America has over 30,000 members and has established an impressive record of community service on both a national and international scale. The community should be commended for its old age home facilities, network of all day schools, community centers, beautifully modern congregational buildings, and other communal institutions that so greatly benefit the areas they serve.</p>\n<p>It is a pleasure to have Rabbi Hecht and other distinguished members of the Syrian Sephardic community join us today, and I especially want to thank the Rabbi for delivering such an inspiring prayer.\n</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<hr />\n\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable toggleable-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th
