Paul Spyros Sarbanes (D-MD)<br />\nDate of Prayer: 25 March 1976</p>\n<p><!-- --></p>\n<blockquote><p>\nMr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, it is a great personal honor for me today that the deeply moving and thoughtful opening prayer has just been offered by Rabbi Nahum M. Ben-Natan.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Ben-Natan is presently the spiritual leader of the Beth Jacob Congregation in Baltimore having succeeded the late Rabbi Uri Miller. The Beth Jacob Congregation was founded in 1938 and in the relatively short span of 38 years has risen to a prominent position as one of the leading Orthodox synagogues in the United States.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Ben-Natan came to Beth Jacob Congregation in 1972 after having served as rabbi of the Young Israel of Ottawa, Canada, Congregation. Previously, he held the position of chaplain of the Hudson River State Hospital, in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and rabbi of the Knesseth Israel Congregation, Birmingham, Ala. His leadership and contributions to our community have been outstanding.</p>\n<p>I would like to offer my thanks to Rabbi Ben-Natan for coming here today and providing us with words of inspiration as we again undertake to conduct the Nation’s business.</p>\n<p>Mr. LONG of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues in welcoming Rabbi Nahum Ben-Natan, who without question is one of the outstanding spiritual leaders of the Baltimore community. We have all benefited very greatly from his inspirational remarks and we wish him well in the years ahead.</p>\n<p>I am very proud that he is a constituent of mine, and delighted that he and his congregation, Beth Jacob, have been honored by the House today in the rabbi’s selection to offer our opening prayer.\n</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<hr />\n\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable toggleable-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"x\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"/translate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contribute&nbsp;a&nbsp;translation</a></th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Source (English)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<span class=\"divine-referent\">Heavenly Father</span>,<br />\nwe, who have gathered in this historic Chamber,<br />\nbearing the responsibilities imposed upon us<br />\nby our constituents, to represent their wishes<br />\nas we debate and discuss pending legislation<br />\naffecting the welfare of our fellow citizens,<br />\nturn to Thee in prayer for guidance,<br />\ninspiration,<br />\nand courage.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nHear their prayer, O <span class=\"divine-referent\">Lord</span>,<br />\nuplift them with Thy wisdom,<br />\ninstill within their hearts and minds<br />\nthe qualities of sensitivity to human need,<br />\ncompassion for the suffering of others,<br />\nand appreciation of the historic and eternal principles<br />\nof freedom,<br />\njustice,<br />\nand democracy<br />\nupon which this great Nation was founded.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nMay the light of Thy truth<br />\nguide the deliberations and actions<br />\nof this Congress,<br />\nthereby enabling it to become<br />\na bastion of honesty, integrity,<br />\nand moral authority for us<br />\nand for all mankind.<br />\n<em>Amen</em>.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<p>This prayer of the guest chaplain was offered in the third month of the first session of the 94th US Congress in the House of Representatives, and published in the <em>Congressional Record</em>, vol. 122, part 7 (1976), page 7962. </p>\n<h3>Source(s)</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_55023\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Congressional-Record-vol--122-part-7-25-March-1976-p--7962.png\" rel=\"lightbox-0\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-55023\" src=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Congressional-Record-vol--122-part-7-25-March-1976-p--7962-250x250.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-55023\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-55023\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Congressional Record, vol. 122, part 7 (25 March 1976), p. 7962</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
