Sean Patrick Maloney, (D-NY)<br />\nDate of Prayer: 06/11/2014</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I welcome Rabbi Eytan Hammerman of Temple Beth Shalom to the House of Representatives and thank him for serving as today&#8217;s guest chaplain.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Hammerman leads the congregation at Temple Beth Shalom and is passionate about serving his neighbors in Mahopac, New York.</p>\n<p>A distinguished scholar, Rabbi Hammerman holds a B.A. and a master&#8217;s degree from the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City and a degree in political science from Columbia University. Before he joined Temple Beth Shalom in 2010, he served small and large congregations in Baltimore, Maryland; White Plains, New York; and northern New Jersey, in addition to serving as director of the Jewish Youth Philanthropy Institute here in Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Hammerman has served the Mahopac community since he was ordained in 2010, and his leadership has united people all throughout the community––no matter what their beliefs or what their background.</p>\n<p>Not only a religious leader, he has long been a political advocate for justice and equality, and especially for a reduction in the horrible plague of gun violence we see in our country.</p>\n<p>He is joined here today by his wife, Rebecca, and his three beautiful daughters, Ary, Rena, and Ilana, as well as his mother– and father–in–law, Marjorie and Dr. Steven Hoffman.</p>\n<p>Not only a religious leader, he is also my friend, and I am proud to call him my friend. I hope you will join me in welcoming Rabbi Hammerman .\n</p></blockquote>\n<hr />\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable toggleable-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"x\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"/translate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contribute a translation</a></th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Source (English)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nOur God and God of our ancestors,<br />\nwe rise in prayer<br />\nin one of the world&#8217;s most sacred spaces.<br />\nThis hallowed Hall<br />\ncombines enormous power<br />\nwith awesome responsibility.<br />\nWe pray that You, O God,<br />\ninspire those who stand before You today––<br />\nmere mortals––<br />\nwomen and men,<br />\nyoung and old,<br />\nthe many races, colors, and ancestries<br />\nthat make up our blessed country.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nIn the Jewish calendar,<br />\nwe have just concluded the Feast of Weeks,<br />\nmarking, we are taught,<br />\nthe receipt of the Bible at Mount Sinai.<br />\nThis was the culmination of a march<br />\nfrom bondage and slavery<br />\ntoward freedom and responsibility.<br />\nWe ask that You bless the Members of this august body<br />\nas they work to guarantee freedom in our day<br />\nso that we may all live long lives;<br />\npeaceful lives of goodness and blessing;<br />\nlives free from shame;<br />\nlives filled with abundance and honor;<br />\nand lives in which our hearts&#8217;
