Berman, Police-Clergy Liaison, New York City Police Department<br />\nSponsor: Rep. Joseph Crowley, (D-NY)<br />\nDate of Prayer: 07/17/2008</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, it is indeed a pleasure and an honor for me today to welcome our guest chaplain, Rabbi Stuart Berman, and to thank him for such a wonderful prayer this morning.</p>\n<p>New York, and my community in particular, have been fortunate to have had someone so dedicated presiding in our area. Most recently, Rabbi Berman served at the Woodside Jewish Center. However, he has had a very accomplished and profound career throughout his lifetime.</p>\n<p>The rabbi nobly served on the Presidential Inaugural Committee, the Presidential Transition Committee, the White House Conference on Children and Youth Drug Abuse Panel, as well as the White House Conference on Aging.</p>\n<p>In 1985, Rabbi Berman made history in the State of Florida and became the first rabbi to ever be appointed a prison chaplain.</p>\n<p>In New York, he again placed the community first and was appointed police-clergy liaison, City of New York Police Department, and Sanitation Department Chaplain. He is also a prolific author of numerous publications and articles, and he previously hosted a weekly television talk show on FAN-TV.</p>\n<p>I would also point out that Rabbi Berman offered a prayer at the dedication of the post office renaming for my predecessor and his friend, our mutual friend, Congressman Tom Manton, when it was being named in his honor.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Berman is joined today by his son, Nathaniel, and his sister, Zell. Audrey, his wife, who is an early childhood specialist with the New York City Board of Education, unfortunately could not be here with us and with him today. But we all know that she is very, very proud of her rabbi.</p>\n<p>Thank you, Rabbi, for being here.\n</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable toggleable-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"x\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"/translate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contribute a translation</a></th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Source (English)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\n<h3>Opening Prayer Given by the Guest Chaplain:</h3>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nAlmighty God,<br />\nguardian of the people of Thy covenant,<br />\nhelp us to reflect clearly<br />\nand strive conscientiously<br />\nin the performance of our responsibilities this day.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nLet us be permeated by the time-tested ideals of our society,<br />\nand may our days be blessed with the enduring accomplishments of this,<br />\nthe 110th Congress.<br />\nWe may be of different faiths,<br />\nbut we share a common love of this great land.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nLet us direct all our efforts<br />\ntoward the eradication of hatred,<br />\nprejudice<br />\nand blindness of mind.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nGrant us breadth of vision<br />\nto build bridges of understanding<br />\namong all the citizens in our communities back home.<br />\nMay we never forget the common bond of kinship<br />\nthat unites all who were created in Thy divine image.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nGrant us strength of body<br />\nand health of mind.<br />\nEnable us to face the challenges of life<br />\nwith faith and courage.<br />\nTeach us, O Lord,<br />\nthe power of love,<br />\nnot the love of power.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nIn moments of doubt,<br />\nstrengthen us in our convictions.<br />\nIn hours of gloom,<br />\nillumine our paths.<br />\nIn adversity and frustration,<br />\ngird us with patience and tolerance.<br />\nAbove all, O Lord,<br />\nimbue us with the wisdom<br />\nto count our blessings.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n&nbsp;<br />\nאָמֵן׃<br />\n</span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nAnd we all say<br />\n<em>Amen</em>.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<h3>Source(s)</h3>\n<p>110th Congress, 2nd Session. <em>Congressional Record</em>, Issue: Vol. 154, No. 118 — Daily Edition (July 17, 2008)</p>\n<p>Link: <a href=\"https://chaplain.house.gov/chaplaincy/display_gc.html?id=647\">https://chaplain.house.gov/chaplaincy/display_gc.html?id=647</a></p>\n<p><iframe width=530 height=312 src='https://www.c-span.org/video/standalone/?c4509187/rabbi-stuart-berman-police-clergy-liaison-nyc-police-department-ny' allowfullscreen='allowfullscreen' frameborder=0></iframe><span class=\"\" style=\"display:block;clear:both;height: 0px;border-top-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;\"></span></p>\n<style>\n       .errordiv { padding:10px;
