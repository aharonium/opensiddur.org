After his release in 1945, he studied briefly in Sweden before he moved to the United States, where he began studying to be a rabbi. He was ordained in 1963. In 1963, he was hired by Temple Rodef Shalom as its first senior rabbi. He held this title for 35 years, prior to his retirement in July, 1998. In 1988, he received his Doctor of Divinity from Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion. He served as Rabbi Emeritus at Temple Rodef Shalom until his death.",

    "content": "<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">\nGuest Chaplain: Rabbi Laszlo Berkowits, Temple Rodef Shalom, Falls Church, Virginia<br />\nDate of Prayer: 14 June 1988<br />\nSponsor: Rep. Frank Wolf (R-VA)</p>\n<blockquote><p> Rep. Wolf: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to welcome to the House of Representatives Rabbi Laszlo Berkowits, who offered our prayer today. Rabbi Berkowits lives in the 10th District of Virginia in Arlington and is Rabbi at Temple Rodef Shalom in Falls Church, Virginia. Rabbi Berkowits is celebrating his 25th year in the pulpit of Temple Rodef Shalom and Iam pleased that he can share his thoughts with us today in our opening prayer.Twenty-five years is an admirable accomplishment. It has come to my attention that Rabbi Berkowits has celebrated over 1,000 bar-bat mitzvahs, 500 brisses and baby namings, 200 weddings, 25 confirmations, and 25 years of leading his congregation through both happy and trying times. This would be a lifetime of activities to rest on, however, Rabbi Berkowits continues to be an active part of his community partially spurred by his experiences in Europe as a survivor of the Holocaust. As a concentration camp prisoner at the end of the war Rabbi Berkowits was moved from Budapest to the infamous Auschwitz camp, then as the allies advanced on Hitler&#8217;s army he was moved to Ravensburg and finally to Wobbelin where he was liberated by United States 82d Airborne troops. Rabbi Berkowits&#8217; journey to northern Virginia is a truly remarkable story and is an example of the perseverance and unity the Jewish people have exhibited in pulling themselves from under the repressions and atrocities of World War II. I celebrate with Rabbi Berkowits and his congregation in his 25th year in northern Virginia, I welcome him to the House of Representatives and I thank him for opening our session today in prayer. In the prayer, this being Flag Day, Rabbi Berkowits mentioned the American flag. Rabbi Berkowits says that when he was liberated by the 82d Airborne, the first thing that he saw was the American flag, and that is what is specially meaningful, that the rabbi is giving the prayer here today on Flag Day.\n</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<hr />\n\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable toggleable-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"x\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"/contributing/upload/\">Contribute&nbsp;a&nbsp;translation</a></th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Source (English)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nO Lord of the Universe, Author of Freedom,<br />\nour hearts are filled with thanksgiving<br />\non this day dedicated to honor the Stars and Stripes,<br />\nthe flag of our beloved country.<br />\nThis flag has been, ever since its creation,<br />\na symbol of hope for the oppressed,<br />\na banner of liberty<br />\nfor the enslaved<br />\nyearning to be free.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nTo this very day<br />\nthis precious symbol of free men and women<br />\nstirs the hearts of our countrymen<br />\nto deeds of valor and sacrifice<br />\nas it did for the generations who came before us.<br />\nFor it is the banner of freedom,<br />\nthe proud flag of the liberators.<br />\nWherever it is raised and unfurled,<br />\nit heralds the sacred message:<br />\n&#8220;Proclaim liberty throughout the land<br />\nto all the inhabitants thereof.&#8221; <span class=\"citation\">(Leviticus 25:10)</span><br />\nO, may it long wave to the joy of our country<br />\nand for freedom everywhere.<br />\n<em>Amen</em>.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<h3>Source(s)</h3>\n<p>100th Congress, 2nd Session. <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4504317/rabbi-laszlo-berkowits-temple-rodef-shalom-falls-church-va%20blank\">C-SPAN</a>.<br />\n<em>Congressional Record</em>, <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/100/crecb/1988/06/14/GPO-CRECB-1988-pt10-7-1.pdf\">Vol. 134, Part 10 — Bound Edition, p. 14316</a>.</p>\n<p><iframe width=530 height=312 src='https://www.c-span.org/video/standalone/?c4504317/rabbi-laszlo-berkowits-temple-rodef-shalom-falls-church-va%20blank' allowfullscreen='allowfullscreen' frameborder=0></iframe><span class=\"\" style=\"display:block;clear:both;height: 0px;border-top-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;\"></span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_47638\" style=\"width: 225px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Congressional-Record-v.-134-part-10-14-June-1988.-p.-14316.png\" rel=\"lightbox-0\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-47638\" src=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Congressional-Record-v.-134-part-10-14-June-1988.-p.-14316-215x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"215\" height=\"300\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-47638\" srcset=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Congressional-Record-v.-134-part-10-14-June-1988.-p.-14316-215x300.png 215w, https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Congressional-Record-v.-134-part-10-14-June-1988.-p.-14316-733x1024.png 733w, https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Congressional-Record-v.-134-part-10-14-June-1988.-p.-14316.png 1170w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-47638\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Congressional Record v. 134, part 10 &#8211; 14 June 1988. p. 14316</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
