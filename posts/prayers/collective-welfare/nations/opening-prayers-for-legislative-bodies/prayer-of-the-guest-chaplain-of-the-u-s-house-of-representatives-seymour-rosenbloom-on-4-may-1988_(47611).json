            "bio": "Seymour Rosenbloom served as rabbi of Congregation Adath Jeshurun in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania from 1978-2014. He is a 1966 graduate of the University of Rochester, and was ordained at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in 1972. Prior to coming to AJ, he served Adat Shalom Synagogue in Farmington Hills, MI, a suburb of Detroit. Rabbi Rosenbloom served many community organizations, and led many congregational and community groups to Israel and Eastern Europe. He pioneered a special sister relationship between Adath Jeshurun and Congregation Hod VeHadar in Kfar Saba, Israel, and inspired many members of AJ to be generous supporters of this sister congregation. Rabbi Rosenbloom has a special interest in \"Jewish men's issues,\" and has lectured and written on the subject using Jewish Biblical materials and the modern texts of Robert Bly, among others. Rabbi Rosenbloom was a member and leader of the Rabbinical Assembly, the worldwide professional organization of Conservative Rabbis, until he broke with the organization on the subject of rabbinic officiation at interfaith wedding ceremonies in 2016. Adath Jeshurun is noted for its unique liturgy, expressed through the Seder Avodah prayer books, originally edited by Rabbi Max D. Klein. Rabbi Rosenbloom extensively edited and revised the Maḥzor Seder Avodah which was issued in 2004, and the Sabbath, Weekdays, and Yom Tov edition, which was inaugurated in 2008 as part of the congregation’s 150th anniversary celebration. In 2013, a new volume, Seder Avodah for a House of Shiva, was introduced.",

    "content": "<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">\nGuest Chaplain: Rabbi Seymour Rosenbloom, Congregation Adath Jeshurun, Elkins Park, Pennsylvania<br />\nDate of Prayer: 4 May 1988<br />\nSponsor: Rep. Lawrence Coughlin (R-PA)</p>\n<blockquote><p> Rep. Coughlin: Mr. Speaker, it is truly an honor to welcome to the House of Representatives today Rabbi Seymour Rosenbloom of Congregation Adath Jeshurun in Elkins Park, PA, which is in the Commonwealth&#8217;s 13th Congressional District.  Rabbi Rosenbloom attended the University of Rochester and the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. He, his wife Beth, and their three sons are residents of Elkins Park. Later this year, Rabbi Rosenbloom will observe the 10th anniversary of his leadership at Adath Jeshurun. During his tenure there Rabbi Rosenbloom has distinguished himself in his service to &#8220;A.J.&#8221; and to the community at large. His congregation, which was founded over 130 years ago and now includes some 1,200 families, will be celebrating the 10th anniversary of his spiritual guidance later this year.  Mr. Speaker, this is a particularly special time for Rabbi Rosenbloom to address the House. First, several dozen members of the congregation are here today to observe the Congress in action and to discuss with Members of Congress the current plight of Soviet Jewry. I know they feel a great sense of pride in seeing their rabbi before the House today. In addition, Rabbi Rosenbloom has just returned from a trip to the Soviet Union, where he, Adath Jeshurun President Arnold Hoffman, and their wives spent 10 days. This group traveled to Leningrad and Moscow and met with a number of refuseniks, including A.J. adoptees Yuli Kosharovsky and Julian Khassin and their families. They saw firsthand the tragedy that befalls those in the Soviet Union who wish to worship freely, study their history and traditions, and pursue their rights to emigrate freely. I make reference to the rabbi&#8217;s visit because today, by contrast, he stands before one of the greatest institutions that democracy has ever known. The differences between his environment last week and the one in which he finds himself today could hardly be more dramatic. In one, free speech is suppressed, free worship is a farce, and basic rights are meted out arbitrarily by the State. In the other, symbolized most profoundly by this very Chamber, the free exchange of ideas is not only allowed, but encouraged. All are free to travel or worship as they see fit. Mr. Speaker, we are grateful for the spirituality, the wisdom, and the moral leadership that Rabbi Rosenbloom shares with us today. As his words echo in this Chamber, let us remember also that there are indeed many who are not so fortunate, who long to express themselves freely and whose basic rights are not secured.\n</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto;
