            "bio": "Rabbi Avraham Soltes (1917-1983) was a Reform Jewish rabbi, the Jewish chaplain at the United States Military Academy in West Point, an author and a leading figure in Jewish cultural affairs. He was born in New York City. He graduated from the City College of New York in 1937 and received a master's degree from Columbia University in 1938. After being ordained in 1942 by the Jewish Institute of Religion (now HUC-JIR), he served as chaplain at Cornell and McGill Universities and then was assistant rabbi at Congregation Rodeph Sholom in Manhattan from 1946 to 1949. He subsequently served as rabbi at Temple Sharey Tefilo in East Orange and Temple Emanuel in Great Neck. He began his service at West Point as a voluntary chaplain in 1963 and was made a permanent member of the staff in 1981. His interests also took him into commerce, and from 1969 to 1974, he was vice president for community affairs of the Glen Alden Corporation, which in 1972 was merged into the Rapid America Corporation. From 1974 to 1977, he was assistant to the president of Tel Aviv University. He was credited with a key role in the establishment of the New York medical division at the university. In 1981, Rabbi Soltes received the Jabotinsky Award from Prime Minister Menachim Begin for his service to Israel. From 1977 until his death Rabbi Soltes had been the spiritual leader of Congregation Beth Chavairuth of Bergen County, in Tenafly, N.J. He participated in many cultural and educational activities that interpreted Jewish art, music and literature. He was chairman of the National Jewish Music Council from 1963 to 1969 and a member of the board of the National Jewish Book Council from 1967 to 1972. Rabbi Soltes, a commentator on Jewish music for American listeners, was the host of a radio program, ''The Music of Israel,'' on WQXR from 1974-1983. Among his writings were <em>Palestine in Poetry and Song of the Jewish Diaspora</em> (Master's thesis HUC-JIR 1942) and <em>Off The Willows: The Rebirth of Modern Jewish Music</em> (1970).",

President Eisenhower suffered a <a href=\"https://text-message.blogs.archives.gov/2016/09/22/heart-attack-strikes-ike-president-eisenhowers-1955-medical-emergency-in-colorado/\">severe heart attack</a> on September 24, 1955. Eisenhower initially planned on serving only one term, but he remained flexible in case leading Republicans wanted him to run again. While recovering from the heart attack late in September, he met with his closest advisors to evaluate the GOP&#8217;s potential candidates. The group concluded that a second term was well advised, and he announced that he would run again in February 1956.</p>\n<h3>Source(s)</h3>\n<style type=\"text/css\">\r\n       .errordiv { padding:10px; margin:10px; border: 1px solid #555555;color: #000000;background-color: #f8f8f8; width:500px; }#advanced_iframe {visibility:visible;opacity:1;vertical-align:top;}.ai-info-bottom-iframe { position: fixed; z-index: 10000; bottom:0; left: 0; margin: 0px; text-align: center; width: 100%; background-color: #ff9999; padding-left: 5px;padding-bottom: 5px; border-top: 1px solid #aaa } a.ai-bold {font-weight: bold;}#ai-layer-div-advanced_iframe p {height:100%;margin:0;padding:0}#ai-div-container-advanced_iframe\r\n       { \r\n           position: relative;\r\n           width: 100%; max-width: 100%;}\r\n       #ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe\r\n       {\r\n          position: absolute;\r\n          z-index:1000;\r\n          margin-left:-33px;\r\n          left: 50%;   top: 150px;\r\n         }} \r\n       #ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe img\r\n       {\r\n          border: none;\r\n       }</style><script type=\"text/javascript\">var ai_iframe_width_advanced_iframe = 0;var ai_iframe_height_advanced_iframe = 0;var aiIsIe8=false;var aiOnloadScrollTop=\"true\";var aiShowDebug=false;\r\n\t\tif (typeof aiReadyCallbacks === 'undefined') {\r\n\t\t\tvar aiReadyCallbacks = [];  \r\n\t\t} else if (!(aiReadyCallbacks instanceof Array)) {\r\n\t\t\tvar aiReadyCallbacks = [];\r\n\t\t}    function aiShowIframeId(id_iframe) { jQuery(\"#\"+id_iframe).css(\"visibility\", \"visible\");    }    function aiResizeIframeHeight(height) { aiResizeIframeHeight(height,advanced_iframe); }    function aiResizeIframeHeightId(height,width,id) {aiResizeIframeHeightById(id,height);}</script><div id=\"ai-div-container-advanced_iframe\"><div id=\"ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-loader-icon\" src=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/plugins/advanced-iframe/img/loader.gif\" title=\"Loading\" alt=\"Loading\"></img></div><iframe id=\"advanced_iframe\"  name=\"advanced_iframe\"  src=\"https://archive.org/stream/tefilahinvocationasheafofprayersavrahamsoltes1959#page/n61/mode/2up\"  width=\"100%\"  height=\"900\"  frameborder=\"0\"  allowtransparency=\"true\"  loading=\"lazy\"  style=\";width:100%;height:900px;;width:1px;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;\"  allowfullscreen  onload='jQuery(&quot;#ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe&quot;).hide();;jQuery(&quot;#ai-div-loader-global&quot;).hide()' ></iframe></div><script type=\"text/javascript\">var ifrm_advanced_iframe = document.getElementById(\"advanced_iframe\");var hiddenTabsDoneadvanced_iframe = false;\r\nfunction resizeCallbackadvanced_iframe() {}var recalculateIframeResizeadvanced_iframe = 0;\r\n        var recalculateIframeOrientationchangeadvanced_iframe = 0;\r\n        var aiWindowWidth = 0;\r\n\t\tfunction recalculateIframeadvanced_iframe() {\r\n          clearTimeout(recalculateIframeResizeadvanced_iframe);\r\n          clearTimeout(recalculateIframeOrientationchangeadvanced_iframe);}  \r\n        function initResponsiveIframeadvanced_iframe() {\r\n          jQuery(window).resize(function() {\r\n\t\t\t recalculateIframeResizeadvanced_iframe = window.setTimeout(\"recalculateIframeadvanced_iframe()\",100);\r\n          });\r\n          if (window.addEventListener) {\r\n            window.addEventListener(\"orientationchange\", function() {\r\n               recalculateIframeOrientationchangeadvanced_iframe = window.setTimeout(\"recalculateIframeadvanced_iframe()\",100);\r\n            }, false);\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n        aiReadyCallbacks.push(initResponsiveIframeadvanced_iframe);</script><style>#advanced_iframe {width: 1px !important;min-width:100% !important;max-width:100% !important;}</style><script type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n",
