    "excerpt": "This civic prayer, recorded by an unknown Montgomery, Alabama newspaper on 16 May 1862, was offered at the dedication of the new <a href=\"https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=86125\">Ḳahl Montgomery synagogue building</a>, by Rabbi James Koppel Gutheim. The newspaper clipping, found in the I. Solomon Collection in the manuscript department of Duke University Library, was transcribed by Dr. Bertram W. Korn for his article, \"The Jews of the Confederacy,\" <em>American Jewish Archives</em> vol. 13, no. 1 (Apr 1961), on pages 40-42.  . . .",
    "content": "<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\" style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">\nJewish prayers for the well-being of the sovereign, government, and country are common in every place Jewish congregations gather. Thus, it is no great surprise to find one offered by a rabbi for the State of Alabama and the Confederate States of America at a dedication ceremony of a new synagogue building in 1862. But given that unrepentant revanchist and racist white supremacists continue to celebrate the Confederacy in our own day, often under the guise of &#8220;honoring southern pride,&#8221; we share the text of this prayer only for its historical import and as a cautious lesson. Patriotism born of genuine appreciation for freedom, liberty, and sanctuary granted to some can blind those privileged to the lives and labor stolen from others. Recognizing such depravity where and when it occurs should ground us in every place we dwell. As Emma Lazarus later argued in &#8220;<a href=\"https://jwa.org/media/quote-from-epistle-to-hebrews\">An Epistle to the Hebrews</a>&#8221; (1883): &#8220;Until we are all free, we are none of us free,&#8221; or as Proverbs 4:14 teaches, &#8220;Enter not into the path of the wicked, and walk not in the way of evil men.&#8221; —Aharon Varady\n</div>\n<hr />\n\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto;
