    "content": "<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">\nOn Saturday morning the Rev. S. Morais alluding to the alarming Bulletin of last Monday from the White House, said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>This week we received again a strikingly painful illustration of human shortsightedness and of the inadequacy of our unaided efforts to cope with Nature. Scarcely any of the inhabitants of this vastly populated land harbored a fear that medical skill would be baffled in its treatment of General Garfield. Almost every one confidently believed that it had overcome the appalling difficulties met at the outset, and that the improvement in the physical condition of the President would proceed steadily. ‘Science has grappled with a dreaded antagonist and won a signal victory.’ So it was imagined.</p>\n<p>On Monday morning we awoke to the sad realization that we had trusted a mere fancy. He whom we considered to have safely overleaped the boundaries of Death, stood ghastly at Death’s door. The strength gathered during six weeks’ exceptional care, sunk on a sudden, because the principal organ whence the blood is nurtured refused its customary office. Then we felt that Nature will not respond to our endeavours, unless its sovereign Maker bids it further our wishes. And we should have then given a perfect assent withal to the teachings of the sages of old, that we ought to thank Providence for every beating of our heart, for our every breath, for every healthful performance of our bodily functions.</p>\n<p>The dear patient whose life a few days ago hung on a thread, doubtless saw, that the arms of Science, unsupported by the Lord, could not carry him unscathed over the yawning grave, and in that fearful crisis he must have turned for effectual assistance to the Power that formed his being.</p>\n<p>My mind pictured to itself that soul-trying moment, while I announced the forthcoming Elul—a month of propitiatory prayers in Sephardic congregations, — and my heart prompted me to anticipate the object of that month’s devotional gatherings by attuning our voices on this very Sabbath in a supplication to the heavenly Physician on behaif of His servant James Abram Garfield. He who can reckon every fibre of the existence He has framed can, and will in His infinite mercy, create a cure thorough and lasting for the man, to whom an entire nation looks, for guide and counsel.</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<hr >\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable toggleable-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"x\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"/translate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contribute a translation</a></th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Source (English)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nAlmighty Father,<br />\nwhose hand is never short to reach out unto us the means of safety!<br />\nLet it be Thy gracious will to do as we petition thee!<br />\nGrant that the air pervading the sick chamber of our chosen Chief<br />\nmay cool the diseased body of the intensity of its heat.<br />\nGrant that the food administered to our chosen Chief<br />\nmay become marrow to his bones,<br />\nnutriment to his flesh;<br />\nthat it may impart a gentler impulse to the circulating blood,<br />\nsuppleness to nerves and sinews.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nOh! may a ray of Thy boundless knowledge<br />\nlight up the understanding of the men and women<br />\nwho watch at the bedside of our chosen Chief;<br />\nso that only what is positively beneficial be given unto him;<br />\nonly what is encouraging be spoken in his presence;<br />\nonly what is cheering be read within his hearing.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nFor the sake of a people to whom political agitations<br />\nmight bring material injury and moral suffering,<br />\nwe pray that Thou wilt vouch safe to rescue our President<br />\nfrom a threatening danger,<br />\nand raise him again to lead us all uprightly.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nFor the sake of a wife ennobled by womanly virtues,<br />\ndecree for her highly exalted husband a useful and long existence.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nFor the sake of the hoary-headed mother<br />\nrevered by her illustrious son and beloved by his seed,<br />\ndeliver James Abram Garfield from the consuming grave.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nBefore the month of Elul shall have passed away<br />\nand we, in deep solemnity shall welcome the day<br />\ncommemorative of the World’s creation,<br />\ncause Thy servant to walk to enlargement.<br />\nLike the Psalmist may he soon joyfully exclaim:<br />\n‘O Lord my God!<br />\nI have cried unto Thee and Thou hast healed us.<br />\nThou hast brought up my existence from the nether world;<br />\nThou hast kept me alive that I should not go down to the pit.’ <span class=\"citation\">(Psalms 30:2-5)</span><br />\n‘To the end that my glorious soul may sing praises unto Thee<br />\nand be not silent’. <span class=\"citation\">(Psalms 30:13 part)</span>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nOh!
