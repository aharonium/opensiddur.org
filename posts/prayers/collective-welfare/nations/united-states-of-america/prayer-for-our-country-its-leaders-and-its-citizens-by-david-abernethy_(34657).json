    "excerpt": "A prayer for the United States, its leaders and government and its citizens -- a personal response to things that were troubling me in the months before November’s election – in particular the level of divisiveness in our country, and what seemed to me to be a growing sense that it isn’t important to respect people we disagree with, and an ever more prevalent belief that we are entitled to decide for ourselves which rules to follow, and all that matters are own rights and our beliefs, not our responsibilities to one another. Inspired by the events of 2020 . . .",

things that were deeply concerning to me in the months leading up to our most recent election.  A rising level of divisiveness in our public discourse.  A common belief that we need not be respectful of those with whom we disagree.  And a growing acceptance of the view that every individual is entitled to choose which of our society’s rules to follow, and which not – that we need only concern ourselves with our own rights and opinions, not our responsibilities to one another.  Over the past few months I have read many beautiful and deeply moving versions of prayers for our country and its government, all highlighting different concerns and challenges, but all reflecting a deeply rooted tradition of concern for the welfare of the nations and communities in which we live.  This one is simply one person’s way of expressing that concern. Shared within a synagogue community but not published elsewhere. &#8211;David Abernethy</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
