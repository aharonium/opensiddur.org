Washington's response to Seixas's letter, in which he quotes some of his most iconic phrasings, is one of the first official statements by the US government on the value of religious freedom. This Letter Reading Event was held in the Old Colony House (where the Jewish community's letter was probably presented to President Washington), rather than in the Touro Synagogue, due to Congregation Shearith Israel in New York's barring of the Touro Synagogue Foundation from access to the building. . . .",
