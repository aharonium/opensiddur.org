It's unsurprising that for a composer as proudly and openly Jewish as Bernstein that even his setting of the Tridentine Mass has major \"shaking your fist at God\" energy. Not gonna lie, I was listening to this on a plane out of Jerusalem as the war was starting, and I started to tear up. I immediately started writing this translation and finished it up in the process of about an hour while stuck somewhere a few thousand feet above Greenland. It's amazing and moving and tragic and enraging and a little full of itself in exactly the right way to hit me in the heart.  . . .",
