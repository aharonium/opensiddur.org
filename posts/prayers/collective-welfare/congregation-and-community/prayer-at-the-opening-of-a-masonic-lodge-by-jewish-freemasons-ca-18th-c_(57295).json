Longworth, at the Shakespeare Gallery, New York City (kindly loaned to us by R.W. Henry C. Banks), we find a number of forms which at the present day appear unique. These forms are spoken of as having been in use for a long period during the last century; and from them we extract two or three Prayers, one or the other of which it was customary to repeat, according to the religious faith of the members of the lodge’ which had assembled.

When Moses came down from the Mount and entered into his tent, Aaron went to visit him, and Moses acquainted Aaron with the laws he had received from God, together with the explanation of them. After this Aaron placed himself at the right hand of Moses, and Eleazer and Ithamar (the sons of Aaron), were admitted, to whom Moses repeated what he had just before toldto Aaron. These being seated, the one on the right hand the other on the left hand of Moses, the seventy elders of Israel who compose the Sanhedrim came in, and Moses again declared the same laws to them, with the interpretation of them, as he had done before to Aaron and his sons. Lastly, all who pleased of the common people were invited to enter, and Moses instructed them likewise in the same manner as the rest. So that Aaron heard four times what Moses had been taught by God upon Mount Sinai; Eleazer and Ithmar three times, the seventy elders twice, and the people once. Moses afterwards reduced the laws which he had received into writing, but not the explanation of them. These he thought it sufficient to trust to the memories of the above mentioned persons, who, being perfectly instructed in them, delivered them to their children, and these again to theirs, from age to age.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>The source for the prayer in its re-printed form is a 1756 work, <em>Ahiman Rezon: or, a help to a brother; shewing the excellency of secrecy, &#8230; Together with Solomon&#8217;s temple an oratorio, as it was performed for the benefit of free-masons</em> by Laurence Dermott (1756).
