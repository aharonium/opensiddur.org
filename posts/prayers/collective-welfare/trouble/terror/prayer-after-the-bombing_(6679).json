The doors to our sanctuary were open, so we had the sounds of the nearby wetland in our ears, and I invited the meditators to join me in cultivating compassion and sending it toward Boston. The line \"My heart is in the east and I am in the west\" is adapted from the medieval Spanish poet Judah haLevi. . . .",
