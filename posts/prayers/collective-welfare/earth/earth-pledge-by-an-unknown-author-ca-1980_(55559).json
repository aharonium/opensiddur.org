In print, the earliest we have yet found it published is in the textbook, <em>Peace through Justice</em> (1983) by Louise Marie Prochaska, however, Sister Prochaska does not recall composing it. The pledge also appeared embedded in an illustration for the Spring 1984 issue of Global Education Associates&#8217; <em>Breakthrough Newsletter</em>. Neither Pat Mische (co-founder of Global Education Associates) nor Sister Miriam MacGillis (inventor of the Cosmic Walk, founder of Genesis Farm, and illustrator of the pledge) recall with certainty composing the pledge, although both think that it is quite possible. I am currently researching back issues of periodicals published by Global Education Associates in the 1970s and early 1980s to determine once and for all, when it was originally published and hopefully, by whom, the pledge was written. &#8211;Aharon Varady</p>\n<h3>Source(s)</h3>\n<p><span style=\"float: right;\"><div id=\"attachment_55561\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Earth-Pledge-Global-Education-Associates-Breakthrough-Newsletter-Spring-1984.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox-0\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-55561\" src=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Earth-Pledge-Global-Education-Associates-Breakthrough-Newsletter-Spring-1984-250x250.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-55561\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-55561\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Earth Pledge (Global Education Associates, Breakthrough Newsletter, Spring 1984)</p></div></span> <span style=\"float: left;\"><div id=\"attachment_55560\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Peace-through-Justice-Earth-Pledge-Louise-Marie-Prochaska-1983-p--277.png\" rel=\"lightbox-1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-55560\" src=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Peace-through-Justice-Earth-Pledge-Louise-Marie-Prochaska-1983-p--277-250x250.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-55560\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-55560\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Peace through Justice &#8211; Earth Pledge (Louise Marie Prochaska 1983), p. 277</p></div></span><span class=\"\" style=\"display:block;clear:both;height: 0px;border-top-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;\"></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
