He graduated the University of Chicago and Meadville Lombard Theological School, and was ordained in 1956. He ministered for fifty years in cities across the country. During the Civil Rights era Clarke Wells was an activist; he was among ministers who went to Selma to march with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1965. Dr. Wells was with his colleague, James Reeb, and his wife, Marie, at a hospital in Birmingham, Alabama when Rev. Reeb (also a Unitarian minister) died after being attacked while participating in the struggle for Civil Rights. He served as Vice President of the Unitarian Universalist Ministers Association (following merger of Unitarians and Universalists in 1961). Dr. Wells taught classes in poetry, creative writing and the works of William Shakespeare. He authored four books of poetry and essays.",

Wells (1930-2006, and included in his collection <em>Sunshine and Rain at Once</em> (1981), p. 20. It is the only place we have so far located an earth pledge in the context of a prayer. Although published in 1981, the essay, including the prayer and pledge, was likely written the previous year in the lead up to Earth Day 1980. . . .",

Wells (1930-2006, and included in his collection <em>Sunshine and Rain at Once</em> (1981), p. 20.  It is the only place we have so far located an earth pledge in the context of a prayer. Although published in 1981, the essay, including the prayer and pledge, was likely written the previous year in the lead up to Earth Day 1980.</p>\n<p>In his posthumous collected works, <em>Continuously Creating Spirit- A Clarke Wells Reader</em> (ed. Barbara Carlson, 2012), this earth pledge is found in the following variation: &#8220;I pledge allegiance to the earth and the biosphere, and to the ecosystem on which it stands, one planet, indivisible, with fresh water and clean air for all&#8221; (p. 79). Two additional earth pledges follow: </p>\n<blockquote><p>\nI pledge allegiance to the globe<br />\nand all people on it;<br />\nand to the environment that cradles our lives,<br />\none earth, interconnected,<br />\nwith pure rivers and sweet rains<br />\nfor all.</p>\n<p>I pledge allegiance to this place<br />\nand to the holy ground that is ours to walk;<br />\nand to the canopy of gracious sky,<br />\none globe, inextricable,<br />\nwith ozone and green trees<br />\nfor all.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>It is unclear where and when these additional earth pledges were first offered. The third pledge is likely dated to around the 20th anniversary of Earth Day in 1990, just after the ban on chlorofluorocarbons instituted in 1987 came into effect (in 1989). </p>\n<h3>Source(s)</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_64081\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/earth-pledge-in-earth-day-sunshine-and-rain-at-once-clarke-wells-unitarian-universalist-association-1981-p--20.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64081\" src=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/earth-pledge-in-earth-day-sunshine-and-rain-at-once-clarke-wells-unitarian-universalist-association-1981-p--20-250x250.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-64081\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-64081\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">earth pledge in Earth Day &#8211; Sunshine and Rain at Once (Clarke Wells, Unitarian Universalist Association 1981), p. 20</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
