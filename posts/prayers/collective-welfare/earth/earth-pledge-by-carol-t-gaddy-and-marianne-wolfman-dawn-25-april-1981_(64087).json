As an undergraduate, she studied Anthrology at the University of the Americas after transferring from the University of Colorado, and was selected for inclusion in the 1967-68 edition of <em>Who's Who in American Universities and Colleges</em>. In 1978 she was awarded a grant from the Arkansas Endowment for the Humanities to sponsor a forum focusing on issues relating to nuclear power at which Dr. Benjamin Spock spoke, among others. In 1981, she co-authored an earth pledge with Carol Gaddy while marching against nuclear weapons following the Titan Ⅱ missile explosion in Damascus, Arkansas in 1980.
