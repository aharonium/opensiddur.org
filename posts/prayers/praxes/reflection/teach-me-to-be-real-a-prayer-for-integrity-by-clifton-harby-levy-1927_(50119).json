            "bio": "Rabbi Clifton Harby Levy (1867–1962), was a Reform rabbi in the United States. Born in New Orleans, he was ordained at Hebrew Union College (1890), served as rabbi of Congregation Gates of Hope, New York City (1890–91), and as superintendent of classes for immigrant children established by the Baron de Hirsch Fund. Levy later served congregations in Lancaster, Pennsylvania (1892–94) and Baltimore, Maryland (1894–96), where he organized a Jewish kindergarten in a religious school and the first United Hebrew Charities. He founded Tremont Temple, Bronx, New York, and was its rabbi from 1906 to 1921. He left the pulpit rabbinate in 1921 and in 1924 organized the Centre of Jewish Science, New York City. As part of the Jewish Science movement, it sought to counter the influence of Christian Science among acculturated American Jews and to inject spirituality into the Reform Jewish synagogue. He was a founding member of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Council_for_Judaism\">American Council for Judaism</a>, which consisted primarily of anti-Zionist Reform rabbis and laymen. While still a student, Levy published a five-act Purim play, <em>Haman and Mordecai</em> (1886). During his stay in Baltimore he edited <em>Jewish Comment</em>. He edited <em>The Bible in Art</em> (1936) and <em>The Bible in Pictures</em> (1942), and served as art editor of the <em>Universal Jewish Encyclopedia</em>.",

    "content": "<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\" style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">\n<blockquote><p>APPLYING JUDAISM TO LIFE </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Science\">Jewish Science</a> is the application of Judaism to the art of living. It utilizes every well tested method for insuring the well being of body, mind and Spirit. It begins with the great appeal accepted by all Jews as the first, last and continuous duty of each and every Jew: “to LOVE the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and all thy soul and all thy might.” </p>\n<p>The attainment of this Love of God is achieved only as we advance in the real contemplation of God, as found in the Universe and within ourselves; the concentration on God as the Eternal and Infinite Source of all life and goodness; the consecration of each human being to the Love of God. </p>\n<p>The demonstration of our Love of God consists in our fuller obedience to every law, physical, mental and Spiritual, all of which emanate from God, and through which we prove our own Godliness. </p>\n<p>Our Love of God is progressive, for it is in proportion to our deeper sense of God, the fuller consciousness of His immanence, within and about us; to our clearer comprehension of God’s laws as made manifest through scientist and Prophet; our completer consecration to God through the more perfect following of all the laws, by which we are attuned to God. </p>\n<p>As we advance in the apprehension of these laws we perfect ourselves through applying all of these principles to living. We do so easily and without strain because of our Love for God, the higher ethical motive. All fear is banished from consciousness because we are sure of the presence of God, and in that presence there can be no fear. </p>\n<p>Every moment of life is inspired by this trust in God, flowing from our certainty of His nearness. We are near God as we are filled with consciousness of Him. We cannot live the better, higher life unless we are possessed of God. We are removed from God only as we close our consciousness to His love and mercy. But we can always return by the deep desire to become harmonized with His law and through that attuned to Him.</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<hr />\n[expander_maker id=\"1\" more=\"TABLE HELP\" less=\"close\"]\r\n<p />\r\n<u style=\"text-underline-offset: 5px;\">TOGGLE COLUMNS (on/off)</u>: <div id=\"column-toggle-container\"></div>\r\n<p />ADJUST COLUMN POSITIONS: select the column header cell and drag it where you want. <strong><a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/images/column-drag6.gif\" rel=\"lightbox\">show me!</a></strong>\r\n<p />COPY INDIVIDUAL COLUMN(S): use <a href=\"https://merribithouse.net/copytables/\">CopyTables</a>, a browser extension.\r\n<hr />\r\n[/expander_maker]\r\n<p />\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto;
