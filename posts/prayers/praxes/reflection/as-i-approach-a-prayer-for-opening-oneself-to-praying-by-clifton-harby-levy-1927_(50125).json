            "bio": "Rabbi Clifton Harby Levy (1867–1962), was a Reform rabbi in the United States. Born in New Orleans, he was ordained at Hebrew Union College (1890), served as rabbi of Congregation Gates of Hope, New York City (1890–91), and as superintendent of classes for immigrant children established by the Baron de Hirsch Fund. Levy later served congregations in Lancaster, Pennsylvania (1892–94) and Baltimore, Maryland (1894–96), where he organized a Jewish kindergarten in a religious school and the first United Hebrew Charities. He founded Tremont Temple, Bronx, New York, and was its rabbi from 1906 to 1921. He left the pulpit rabbinate in 1921 and in 1924 organized the Centre of Jewish Science, New York City. As part of the Jewish Science movement, it sought to counter the influence of Christian Science among acculturated American Jews and to inject spirituality into the Reform Jewish synagogue. He was a founding member of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Council_for_Judaism\">American Council for Judaism</a>, which consisted primarily of anti-Zionist Reform rabbis and laymen. While still a student, Levy published a five-act Purim play, <em>Haman and Mordecai</em> (1886). During his stay in Baltimore he edited <em>Jewish Comment</em>. He edited <em>The Bible in Art</em> (1936) and <em>The Bible in Pictures</em> (1942), and served as art editor of the <em>Universal Jewish Encyclopedia</em>.",

    "content": "<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">\n<blockquote><p>I WANT TO PRAY </p>\n<p>At every turn in life I want to pray, because that is my way of placing myself in accord with God. Especially when I awake each morning I want to feel that God is with me, and I can do so only as I place myself in harmony with Him. As I lift my consciousness towards God I feel the inpouring of His power, and the day is made beautiful because of the inner light and inspiration. </p>\n<p>The awareness of God colors my every thought, and raises each act to the plane of service. As I work with and for those about me am I serving God, fulfilling one or more of His laws of laboring with my fellow man. Each true thought, every fine deed, is part of my prayers to God. The thought of God lifts me above the mere material, and gives meaning to all I do, even to the simplest task of every-day life. It makes the Spirit with which I work, and aids me in living up to the higher ideals of human action. </p>\n<p>When I pray I am talking with God, and that alone should give me pause, and help me to the fine reverence for Him and for His Universe in which I am a mote. Yet as the motes dance in the sunbeams of God’s goodness, we receive the light and help which we need at every moment of life. Following the beam of light to its Divine Source I am attuned with God, through my willing obedience to every law I know, my eagerness to learn more of these laws, day by day. </p>\n<p>The nearness of God drives out all fear, or doubt. I am filled with the joy of existence, and in my perfect trust and faith, I gain that courage and confidence which overcomes each obstacle to worthy achievement. I feel myself a very child of God, worthy of my heritage of mind and Spirit, all turned towards Him. I have no cares, for I am certain of the Supreme help which comes freely to all who are in harmony with God. </p>\n<p>No prayer of mine is ever twice the same, for I see more clearly, feel more deeply as I grow in God-consciousness, and feel after God with loftier purpose. I pray in the light of the newer day and the finer touch with God. </p>\n<p>And when I seek God I ask for that which I need most, not for the things which I can gather, but for the Spirit by which I may grow to greater heights. That is the prayer of the yearning heart, which seeks the Spirit of love and of service, seeking the Godly, to make us more truly human.</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto;
