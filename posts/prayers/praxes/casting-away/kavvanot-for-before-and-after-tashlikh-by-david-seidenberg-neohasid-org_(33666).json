With <em>smikhah</em> (ordination) from the Jewish Theological Seminary and from <a href=\"/profile/zalman-schachter-shalomi/\">Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi</a>, he has taught at over 100 synagogues, communities, retreats and conferences across North America (and a few in Europe and Israel). Rabbi Seidenberg's teaching empowers learners to become creators of Judaism through deep study and communion with texts and tradition. Areas of specialty include Kabbalah and Ḥasidut, Talmud, davenning, evolution and cosmology, sustainability, Maimonides, Buber, and more. Rabbi Seidenberg has <a href=\"http://neohasid.org/about/pub\">published widely</a> on ecology and Judaism and is the author of <em>Kabbalah and Ecology: God's Image in the More-Than-Human World</em> (Cambridge University Press, 2015).",

    "content": "<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">\n&#8220;<em>Tashlikh bim&#8217;tsulot hayam kol chatotam</em> – You will cast into the depths of the sea all of their sins!&#8221;</p>\n<p>The practice of Tashlikh comes from a time when no one could imagine that human acts could deplete entire oceans. The vastness of the sea, its capacity to receive and transform, to cleanse all, to breakdown and replenish, this is what we evoke in Tashlikh ~ something that Walt Whitman also wrote about in <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (from &#8220;<a href=\"https://iwp.uiowa.edu/whitmanweb/en/writings/civil-war/week-3/this-compost\">This Compost</a>&#8220;):</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">What chemistry!<br />\nThat the winds are really not infectious,<br />\nThat this is no cheat, this transparent green-wash of<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sea, which is so amorous after me,<br />\nThat it is safe to allow it to lick my naked body all<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over with its tongues,<br />\nThat it will not endanger me with the fevers that<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have deposited themselves in it,<br />\nThat all is clean forever and forever&#8230;</p>\n<p>Now our appetites consume whole species of fish, though fish are our model and metaphor for unimaginable fecundity. Industries kill off reefs; oil spills entire coastlines. Our ways of agriculture wash ages of good soil into the ocean, along with pesticides and manure. The greatest earthly symbol of the infinite is reaching its limits in our generation. We need to acknowledge this reality in our Tashlikh liturgy.\n</p></div>\n<hr />\n\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable toggleable-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"x\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"/translate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contribute a translation</a></th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Source (English)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\n<span class=\"instruction\">A kavvanah for before:</span><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nMay the leavings of our lives and actions be like bread,<br />\nwhich cast on the water can become food and nourishment in the cycle of life.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nMay what we take from the Earth be what comes to us naturally,<br />\nlike the grasses that first gave humanity grain,<br />\nand unbiddingly, like the wild yeast.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nMay we repair our arc in the circle of life,<br />\nso that what comes to us flows from what is enough,<br />\nand what comes from us flows back into the great river of being<br />\nthat is ever created by the One Source of Being.&#8221;\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nכַּכָּתוּב: לֹא־יָרֵעוּ וְלֹא־יַשְׁחִיתוּ בְּכָל־הַר קָדְשִׁי<br />\nכִּי־מָלְאָה הָאָרֶץ דֵּעָה אֶת־ה׳<br />\nכַּמַּיִם לַיָּם מְכַסִּים׃<br />\n</span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\n<span class=\"instruction\">A kavvanah for after:</span><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nMay this act of casting away,<br />\nof emptying ourselves of what has passed,<br />\nbecome a beginning of filling ourselves anew.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nMay we dwell in awareness<br />\nthat the Creator fills and surrounds every hollow and space in this planet,<br />\njust as these waters fill (this stream and this stream fills) the ocean,<br />\nso that may we learn and teach each other how to live<br />\nwithout destroying and ruining this world<br />\nthat is the source of our life.<br />\nAs it says, &#8216;<em>Lo yarei&#8217;u v&#8217;lo yashḥitu b&#8217;khol har kodshi,<br />\nki mal&#8217;ah ha&#8217;arets dei&#8217;ah et Adonai<br />\nkamayim layam m&#8217;khasim</em>.&#8217;<br />\n&#8220;They will not harm and they will not ruin or destroy anywhere in My mount of holiness,<br />\nfor [they will understand that] the Earth is filled with knowing YHVH,<br />\nlike the waters are covering the sea&#8221; <span class=\"citation\">(Isaiah 11:9)</span>.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
