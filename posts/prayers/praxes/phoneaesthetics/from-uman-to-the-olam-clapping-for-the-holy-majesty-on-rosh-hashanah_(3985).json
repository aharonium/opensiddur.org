With <em>smikhah</em> (ordination) from the Jewish Theological Seminary and from <a href=\"/profile/zalman-schachter-shalomi/\">Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi</a>, he has taught at over 100 synagogues, communities, retreats and conferences across North America (and a few in Europe and Israel). Rabbi Seidenberg's teaching empowers learners to become creators of Judaism through deep study and communion with texts and tradition. Areas of specialty include Kabbalah and Ḥasidut, Talmud, davenning, evolution and cosmology, sustainability, Maimonides, Buber, and more. Rabbi Seidenberg has <a href=\"http://neohasid.org/about/pub\">published widely</a> on ecology and Judaism and is the author of <em>Kabbalah and Ecology: God's Image in the More-Than-Human World</em> (Cambridge University Press, 2015).",

    "content": "<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">\nDuring the ten days from Rosh Hashanah to Yom Kippur, we change the third blessing of the Amidah from &#8220;Blessed be You, the Holy God&#8221; <em>ha&#8217;el hakadosh</em> to &#8220;Blessed be You, the Holy King&#8221; hamelekh hakadosh. In Uman, Ukraine (and in the Breslov community in general) during the repetition of Rosh Hashanah <em>Musaf</em>, when the ḥazan gets to the special brokha in the Amidah for <em>Yamim Nora&#8217;im</em> [the Days of Awe]: <em>Barukh Atah Adonai Hamelekh Hakadosh</em>, something beautiful happens. Everyone begins clapping for the King, and it continues for minutes on end. It sounds corny, but in a shul of 3,000, it&#8217;s awesome. Not only awesome, but truly joyful.</p>\n<p>This is something anyone, any minyan, can do —- no Hebrew knowledge necessary. It works best when most of the people do it, and it is truly wonderful. I can&#8217;t think of a more playful way to take what we say in prayer seriously.</p>\n<p>Clapping for God – try it in Long Island and Iowa. It&#8217;s not just for Uman!\n</p></div>\n<hr />\n<p>This work was originally published by Rabbi David Seidenberg, on neohasid.org <a href=\"http://neohasid.org/resources/hamelekh_hakadosh/\">here</a>.</p>\n",
