            "bio": "Rabbi Dr. Zalman Meshullam Schachter-Shalomi, affectionately known as \"Reb Zalman\" (28 August 1924 – 3 July 2014) was one of the founders of the Jewish Renewal movement. Born in Żółkiew, Poland (now Ukraine) and raised in Vienna, he was interned in detention camps under the Vichy Regime but managed to flee the Nazi advance, emigrating to the United States in 1941. He was ordained as an Orthodox rabbi in 1947 within the ḤaBaD Hasidic movement while under the leadership of the sixth Lubavitcher Rebbe, Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn, and served ḤaBaD communities in Massachusetts and Connecticut. He subsequently earned an M.A. in psychology of religion at Boston University, and a doctorate from the Hebrew Union College. He was initially sent out to speak on college campuses by the Lubavitcher Rebbe, but  in the early 1960s, after experimenting with \"the sacramental value of lysergic acid\", the main ingredient in LSD, leadership within ḤaBaD circles cut ties with him. He continued teaching the Torah of Ḥassidut until the end of his life to creative, free and open-minded Jewish thinkers with humility and kindness and established warm ecumenical ties as well. In September 2009, he became the first contributor of a siddur to the Open Siddur Project database of Jewish liturgy and related work. Reb Zalman supported the Open Siddur Project telling its founder, \"this is what I've been looking forward to!\" and sharing among many additional works of liturgy, an interview he had with Havurah magazine in the early to mid-1980s detailing his vision of \"<a href=\"http://opensiddur.org/development/press/database-davvenen-by-reb-zalman-schachter-shalomi-havurah/\">Database Davenen</a>.\" The Open Siddur Project is proud to be realizing one of Reb Zalman's long held dreams.",

            "bio": "Netanel Miles-Yépez is an artist, religion scholar, and spiritual teacher.\r\n\r\nBorn into a Mexican-American family, in his late teens, Miles-Yépez discovered his family's hidden Jewish roots and began to explore Judaism and other religions seriously. After studying history of religions and comparative religion at Michigan State University, he moved to Boulder, Colorado to study with the innovative Hasidic master and leader in ecumenical dialogue, Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, founder of the Jewish Renewal movement. In addition to Schachter-Shalomi, he also studied with various Sufi masters and teachers of Buddhism, and counts Father Thomas Keating, Trappist monk and founder of the Centering Prayer movement, as an important influence. In 2004, he and Schachter-Shalomi co-founded the Sufi-Hasidic, Inayati-Maimuni Order, fusing the Sufi and Hasidic principles of spirituality and practice espoused by Rabbi Avraham Maimuni in 13th-century Egypt with the teachings of the Ba’al Shem Tov and Hazrat Inayat Khan. Currently, he teaches in the Department of Religious Studies at Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado.\r\n\r\nAs a writer on religious subjects, he is known for his critically acclaimed commentaries on Hasidic spirituality (written with Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi), A Heart Afire: Stories and Teachings of the Early Hasidic Masters (2009) and A Hidden Light: Stories and Teachings of Early HaBaD and Bratzlav Hasidism (2011). He is also the editor several ecumenical works, including The Common Heart: An Experience of Interreligious Dialogue (2006) and Meditations for InterSpiritual Practice (2011).\r\n\r\nAs an artist, Miles-Yépez is mostly known for his vibrant paintings, influenced by traditional religious imagery and his Mexican-American heritage. His work in general represents a lifelong fascination with religious iconography, myth and symbol, image and archetype, cultural impressions and his own ancestry. Most of his work is concerned with the acculturation and use of traditional symbols and iconic forms in a new multi-cultural paradigm.",

    "content": "<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\" style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">\nIn March 2016, R&#8217; Netanel Miles-Yépez <a href=\"http://netanelmy.com/blog-1/2016/3/1/reb-zalmans-holy-graffiti\">wrote</a>: </p>\n<blockquote><p>Years ago, my teacher, Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, of blessed memory, told me that he had once hiked into the mountains and spray-painted &#8220;holy graffiti&#8221; on a water reserve tank. He was inspired by the experiments of Dr. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masaru_Emoto\">Masaru Emoto</a> who claimed that even writing emotionally charged words on a bottle of water changed the structure of the water itself. Words of hate created chaotic structures, and words of love, beautiful patterns. So Reb Zalman took a path into the mountains behind his home in Boulder and hiked up to a large water tank that provided water to the community and spray-painted on it: &#8220;Blessings for peace, health, joy, prosperity, and kindness.&#8221; Today, a little over a year since his passing, I decided to hike up into the mountains to see if I could find the water tank and see if his holy graffiti still existed. I reached the water tank just after six o&#8217;clock in the evening. There was plenty of graffiti on it, but none of it &#8220;holy&#8221;—at least not on the part of it I could see. I decided to look around the back of it. The ground was wet, so I walked the narrow cement edge around the tank, until finally, I came to the faded black remains of Reb Zalman&#8217;s graffiti. After some twenty years, and probably more than one paint over, it was still here! There was no vantage point from which to take a picture of all of it, so I did what I could to capture it in a series of photos. </p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<hr />\n[expander_maker id=\"1\" more=\"TABLE HELP\" less=\"close\"]\r\n<p />\r\n<u style=\"text-underline-offset: 5px;\">TOGGLE COLUMNS (on/off)</u>: <div id=\"column-toggle-container\"></div>\r\n<p />ADJUST COLUMN POSITIONS: select the column header cell and drag it where you want. <strong><a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/images/column-drag6.gif\" rel=\"lightbox\">show me!</a></strong>\r\n<p />COPY INDIVIDUAL COLUMN(S): use <a href=\"https://merribithouse.net/copytables/\">CopyTables</a>, a browser extension.\r\n<hr />\r\n[/expander_maker]\r\n<p />\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable toggleable-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"x\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"/contributing/upload/\">Contribute&nbsp;a&nbsp;translation</a></th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Source (English)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\nבָּרוּךְ אַתָּה<br />\n יְיָ אֶלֹהֵינוּ<br />\n מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם,<br />\n אֲשֶׁר קִדְּשָׁנוּ בְּמִצְוֺתָיו,<br />\n וְצִוָנוּ עַל טְבִלַת כֶּלִי:\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\">\nBlessed are you,<br />\nYHVH our <em>elo&#8217;ah</em>,<br />\ncosmic majesty,<br />\nwho hallowed us with their mitsvot,<br />\nand obligated us to immerse a new vessel.</p>\n<p>Barukh atah,<br />\nAdonai Eloheinu,<br />\nmelekh ha-olam,<br />\nasher kidshanu bemitsvotav,<br />\nvetsivanu al tevilat kli\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\">\n<span class=\"instruction\">Before drinking water or any healthy liquid, make a blessing to acknowledge the one from whom all is created.</span>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\nבָּרוּךְ אַתָּה<br />\n יְיָ אֱלֹהֵֽינוּ<br />\n מֶֽלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם<br />\n שֶׁהַכֹּל נִהְיָה בִּדְבָרוֹ:‏\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\">\nBlessed are you,<br />\nYHVH our <em>elo&#8217;ah</em>,<br />\ncosmic majesty,<br />\nWho brings all things into being through their word (<em>logos</em>).</p>\n<p>Barukh atah,<br />\nAdonai Eloheinu,<br />\nmelekh ha-olam,<br />\nshehakol nih’yeh bid’varo\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\">\n<span class=\"instruction\">And after you feel satiated, remember to bless.</span>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\nבָּרוּךְ אַתָּה<br />\n יְיָ אֱלֹהֵֽינוּ<br />\n מֶֽלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם<br />\n בּוֹרֵא נְפָשׁוֹת רַבּוֹת<br />\n וְחֶסְרוֹנָן עַל כָּל מַה שֵּׁבָּרָאתָ<br />\n לְהַחֲיוֹת בָּהֶם נֶֽפֶשׁ כָּל חָי:<br />\n בָּרוּךְ חַי הָעוֹלָמִים:\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\">\nBlessed are you,<br />\nYHVH our <em>elo&#8217;ah</em>,<br />\nCosmic Majesty,<br />\nwho creates a diverse multitude of creatures,<br />\neach shaped with a dependency (ḥesronan, lit. &#8216;absence&#8217;)<br />\nthrough which it is enlivened with the Spirit of Life.<br />\nBlessed is the Life of the Worlds.</p>\n<p>Barukh atah<br />\nAdonai Eloheinu<br />\nmelekh ha‘olam<br />\nborei nefashot<br />\nrabot veḥesronan<br />\nal kol mah shebara’ta<br />\nlehaḥayot bahem<br />\nnefesh kol ḥai<br />\nbarukh ḥei ha‘olamim\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<p>Since I&#8217;m nowhere near Colorado I figured that if I could stitch together the images Reb Netanel took, I too could take part in Reb Zalman&#8217;s intention and blessing.
