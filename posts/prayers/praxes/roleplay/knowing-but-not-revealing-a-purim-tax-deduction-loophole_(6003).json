We develop the capacity to know each others hearts and find even greater satisfaction in the exchange. Yet, too often, we act as if <em>someone else</em> -- who looks remarkably like oneself -- is going to provide the support for nonprofit organizations we deem are necessary for a decent life. We assume / hope / pray that someone “else” is doing <em>our</em> part. It’s <em>their</em> turn to make a critical contribution, even a small one, that gives relief, replaces a worn-out part, opens the door wide enough to make a difference.  . . .",
