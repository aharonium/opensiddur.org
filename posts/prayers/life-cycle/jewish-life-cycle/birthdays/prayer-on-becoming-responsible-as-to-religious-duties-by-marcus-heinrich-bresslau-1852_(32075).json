            "bio": "Marcus Heinrich (also Mordecai Ḥayyim/Hyman/Heyman) Bresslau (ca. 1808-15 May 1864) was a Hebraist and newspaper editor. Born in Hamburg, he settled in England when young. For some time from 1834 he was Baal Ḳoreh (reader) at the Western Synagogue. He then taught Hebrew at the Westminster Jews’ Free School and went on to tutor privately. A maskil, he became involved with M. J. Raphall’s <em>Hebrew Review and Magazine of Rabbinical Literature</em> (1834-6). In October 1844 he was appointed editor of the relaunched <em>Jewish Chronicle</em> by proprietor Joseph Mitchell. Prickly and quarrelsome, he resigned in July 1848 but returned in around September. He remained until about October 1850. After Mitchell’s death in June 1854 he became proprietor (his middle name appearing as Heyman) and edited it until February 1855 when new proprietor Abraham Benisch succeeded him. Bresslau, who tried vainly to revive the <em>Hebrew Review</em>, wrote Hebrew poetry, produced a Hebrew grammar and a Hebrew dictionary, and translated various Hebrew manuscripts in the Bodleian Library. Bresslau compiled (we think) the first compilation of teḥinot in English for women. (Much of this information via Bresslau's entry in The Palgrave Dictionary of Anglo-Jewish History)",

I am fully conscious, that the lofty sentiments which animate me this day, will not be lasting, unless I supplicate Thee, all-just Father, that Thou mayest preserve within me as many of these sentiments as are necessary, to keep me far away from the path of sinfulness, and to stimulate me to the performance of all that is good. O cause the salutary impressions of this day to preponderate over allurements to evil, cause the pious emotions that move my heart, to guide me into the new relations for life, in which I shall have to enter; cause the power of faith to keep me erect even under the heavy burdens of life.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nHoly resolves are the sacrifice, which my gratitude offers unto Thee in this hour so sacred unto me; cause, O Lord, that I may continue to be mindful of them, that the perception of their holiness may not perish within me, so that the strength required for their fulfilment may never fail me.
