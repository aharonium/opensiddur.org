With <em>smikhah</em> (ordination) from the Jewish Theological Seminary and from <a href=\"/profile/zalman-schachter-shalomi/\">Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi</a>, he has taught at over 100 synagogues, communities, retreats and conferences across North America (and a few in Europe and Israel). Rabbi Seidenberg's teaching empowers learners to become creators of Judaism through deep study and communion with texts and tradition. Areas of specialty include Kabbalah and Ḥasidut, Talmud, davenning, evolution and cosmology, sustainability, Maimonides, Buber, and more. Rabbi Seidenberg has <a href=\"http://neohasid.org/about/pub\">published widely</a> on ecology and Judaism and is the author of <em>Kabbalah and Ecology: God's Image in the More-Than-Human World</em> (Cambridge University Press, 2015).",

I continued to work on this ḳaddish and have been sharing it with people in my home community, and people seem to really love it and get a lot out of it. So I thought I would share it with you all now (even though most will probably only see it after Rosh Hashanah), because you may find it useful in two ways:</p>\n<p>1) As a kind of prayer for Creation in the spirit of the Rosh Hashanah liturgy that hopes for the time when &#8220;all creatures become united in one band&#8221; to serve God.</p>\n<p>2) As an alternative ḳaddish to do at any point in the service where people might get benefit from something that they can read in English. As such this is not a replacement for kaddish but it might work as one of several ḳaddishes that get said in a service.\n</p></div>\n<hr />\n\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable toggleable-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"x\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"/translate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contribute a translation</a></th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Adapted Source (English)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\">\n<span class=\"instruction\">[Mourners:]</span> </p>\n<p>May the Name that fills all names<br />\nbe blessed and strengthened in this created world. </p>\n<p>May the Breath of Life that fills all breaths fill us with Life,<br />\nand may it guide and rule our actions and visions,<br />\nin our lives and in our time,<br />\nnow in this world,<br />\nand in every moment to come. </p>\n<p>And let us say: <em>Amen</em>.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\">\n<span class=\"instruction\">[Everyone:]</span> <em>Amen</em>. </p>\n<p>May that great Name be blessed within us<br />\nand in all worlds,<br />\nfor all time.\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\">\n<span class=\"instruction\">[Mourners:]</span> </p>\n<p>May Holiness stream forth from its Source,<br />\nfull of blessing and beauty. </p>\n<p>May the Name that weaves all Life<br />\nbe blessed and praised,<br />\nmade beautiful and resplendent,<br />\nlifted up and exalted,<br />\nto the highest and most majestic… (<span class=\"instruction\">[Everyone:]</span> Blessed be!)<br />\n…beyond all the praises and blessings<br />\nand songs and prayers<br />\nthat can ever be said in the whole world. </p>\n<p>And let us say: (<span class=\"instruction\">[Everyone:]</span> <em>Amen</em>.)\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\">\n<span class=\"instruction\">[Mourners:]</span> </p>\n<p>May the Life and Love<br />\nwithin us and between us<br />\nbe strengthened. </p>\n<p>May the Breath<br />\nthat fills all breaths<br />\nfill the Cosmos with Peace,<br />\nand may Peace and Life flow to us,<br />\nto our community,<br />\nto all peoples,<br />\nand to all beings in this world. </p>\n<p>And let us say: (<span class=\"instruction\">[Everyone:]</span> <em>Amen</em>.)\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\">\n<span class=\"instruction\">[Mourners:]</span> </p>\n<p>The One who makes Peace<br />\nin the furthest reaches of Creation<br />\nwill bring Peace to us<br />\nand to all living beings. </p>\n<p>And let us say: (<span class=\"instruction\">[Everyone:]</span> <em>Amen</em>.)\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<p>This mourners kaddish was first published by Rabbi David Seidenberg on the Chasidus without Borders google group as &#8220;<a href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/msg/hasid/MuRJPscwYkA/8jfkE_tMAwAJ\">Kaddish for a Human Minyan</a>&#8221; on 9 September 2018.</p>\n",
