    "excerpt": "Jews use the Kaddish to mourn the dead, though it has in it only one word — “nechamata,” consolations – which hints at mourning. And this word itself is used in a puzzling way, once we look at it with care. As we will see below, it may be especially appropriate in time of war. The interpretive English translation below may also be appropriate for prayers of mourning and hope in wartime by other spiritual and religious communities. In this version, changes in the traditional last line of the Hebrew text specifically include not only peace for the people Israel (as in the traditional version) but also for the children of Abraham and Hagar through Ishmael (Arabs and Muslims) and for all the life-forms who dwell upon this planet. . . .",
    "content": "<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\" style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">\nJews use the Ḳaddish to mourn the dead, though it has in it only one word — <span class=\"hebrew\" lang=\"heb\">נֶחְמָתָא</span> “<em>neḥamata</em>,&#8221; consolations – which hints at mourning. And this word itself is used in a puzzling way, once we look at it with care. As we will see below, it may be especially appropriate in time of war.</p>\n<p>The English also suggests why in the midst of saying we cannot praise, celebrate, or sing to God enough to meet the Reality, we also say we cannot CONSOLE (<em>neḥamata</em>) God enough. Why we need to praise God and why we cannot give sufficient praise are clear enough; but why do we need to console God, and why can we not give God consolation enough? We suggest that for the killing of one human, bearing the Image of God, by another –- for this, God is inconsolable.</p>\n<p>In this version, changes in the traditional last line of the Hebrew text specifically include not only peace for the people Israel (as in the traditional version) but also for the children of Abraham and Hagar through Ishmael (Arabs and Muslims) and for all the life-forms who dwell upon this planet. The interpretive English addresses the meaning of the Name God is given in most of the Ḳaddish — <span class=\"hebrew\" lang=\"heb\">שְׁמֵהּ רַבָּא</span> “<em>shmeh rabba</em>,” the “Great Name.” It is understood as that Name which includes all the names of all beings in the universe and which is also present within all beings. The Ḳaddish also prays first with concern for the peaceful life of the Jewish “family,” the people Israel, and then in this version expands that concern to include our cousins the children of Abraham through Ishmael and all who dwell upon the earth.</p>\n<p>The interpretive English translation below may be appropriate for prayers of mourning and hope in wartime by other spiritual and religious communities.\n</p></div>\n<hr />\n\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable toggleable-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"x\" style=\"text-align: right;\">Aramaic</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Translation (English)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb\">\nיִתְגַּדַּל וְיִתְקַדַּשׁ שְׁמֵהּ רַבָּא (<span class=\"instruction\">קהל:</span> אָמֵן)‏<br />\n</span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng\">\n<em>Yitgadal V’yit’ḳadash Shmeih Rabba</em> —</p>\n<p>May the Great Name,<br />\nthrough our expanding awareness and our fuller action,<br />\nlift Itself to become still higher and more holy;</p>\n<p>May all the Names of all the beings in the universe,<br />\nincluding those whom we can no longer touch<br />\nbut who have touched our hearts and lives,<br />\nand including our own names,<br />\nlive within the Great Name;</p>\n<p>May the names of all who have died in violence and war<br />\nbe kept alight in our sight and in the Great Name,<br />\nwith sorrow that we were not yet able to shape a world<br />\nin which they would have lived.</p>\n<p>May the Great Name,<br />\nbearing ALL these names,<br />\nlive within each one of us;<br />\n(<span class=\"instruction\">Cong:</span> <em>Amen</em>)\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb\">\nבְּעָלְמָא דִּי בְרָא כִרְעוּתֵהּ<br />\nוְיַמְלִיךְ מַלְכוּתֵהּ<br />\nבְּחַיֵּיכוֹן וּבְיוֹמֵיכוֹן<br />\nוּבְחַיֵּי דְכָל בֵּית יִשְׂרָאֵל<br />\nבַּעֲגָלָא וּבִזְמַן קָרִיב<br />\nוְאִמְרוּ אָמֵן.
