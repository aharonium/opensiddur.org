            "bio": "Marcus Heinrich (also Mordecai Ḥayyim/Hyman/Heyman) Bresslau (ca. 1808-15 May 1864) was a Hebraist and newspaper editor. Born in Hamburg, he settled in England when young. For some time from 1834 he was Baal Ḳoreh (reader) at the Western Synagogue. He then taught Hebrew at the Westminster Jews’ Free School and went on to tutor privately. A maskil, he became involved with M. J. Raphall’s <em>Hebrew Review and Magazine of Rabbinical Literature</em> (1834-6). In October 1844 he was appointed editor of the relaunched <em>Jewish Chronicle</em> by proprietor Joseph Mitchell. Prickly and quarrelsome, he resigned in July 1848 but returned in around September. He remained until about October 1850. After Mitchell’s death in June 1854 he became proprietor (his middle name appearing as Heyman) and edited it until February 1855 when new proprietor Abraham Benisch succeeded him. Bresslau, who tried vainly to revive the <em>Hebrew Review</em>, wrote Hebrew poetry, produced a Hebrew grammar and a Hebrew dictionary, and translated various Hebrew manuscripts in the Bodleian Library. Bresslau compiled (we think) the first compilation of teḥinot in English for women. (Much of this information via Bresslau's entry in The Palgrave Dictionary of Anglo-Jewish History)",

Let me beseech Thee to strengthen me in my faith, to fortify me in the practice of virtue, so that I do not despair in misfortune, not waste my health in excessive grief, not dream away my time in activity, nor seclude myself from the world. The heavier I feel the loss of a sisterly companion from my side, full of love and noble-mindedness, the more will I endevour to manifest at all times, and in every place, a genuine sense of religion. The more I acknowledge that neither personal attractions nor the multitude of mundane treasures are able to save us, when Thy impenetrable decree, Heavenly Father recalls us from the scenes of this life, the more will I strive to prepare myself for immortality; thus whilst I live I shall feel no horror or fear of death, but receive with composure and resignation every fate which Thou mayest decree upon me.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\">\nYet, how unstable and deceptive is the heart of mortals! do not our firmest resolves, our gravest determinations, our longest matured designs dissolve as quickly as a bubble? True, at the present moment, in this mournful place, the alluring charms of the outer world can exercise no influence upon me. But shall I not become wavering in these pious sentiments when I am again in the midst of the living, surrounded by the dazzling show and pomp of life? Will not vanity, eagerness for display and other weaknesses, gain power over me? Be Thou, O Lord, my protector, my refuge, and my stay, in the hour of trial; may, then, be present to my mind, the image of her who now reposes in the shadow of death, of her whose sisterly love and truth warned me of dangers and impiety during her lifetime. O, let me with renewed vigour leave this silent abode of peace, for the active scenes of life, so that as a useful member of society I may serve my fellow creatures. Mayest thou, beloved sister, resting in the land of bliss, enjoy eternal salvation, whilst I, by the gracious assistance of our heavenly Father, will strive to serve Him, whose name be blessed to all eternity. <em>Amen</em>.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<p>&#8220;Prayer on the Grave of a Sister&#8221; was first published in Marcus Heinrich Bresslau&#8217;s collection of teḥinot, <em><a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/compilations/sifrei-tehinot/devotions-for-the-daughters-of-israel-by-marcus-heinrich-bresslau-1852/\">Teḥinot Banot Yisrael: Devotions for the Daughters of Israel</a></em> (1852).</p>\n<h3>Source(s)</h3>\n<style type=\"text/css\">\r\n       .errordiv { padding:10px; margin:10px; border: 1px solid #555555;color: #000000;background-color: #f8f8f8; width:500px; }#advanced_iframe {visibility:visible;opacity:1;vertical-align:top;}.ai-info-bottom-iframe { position: fixed; z-index: 10000; bottom:0; left: 0; margin: 0px; text-align: center; width: 100%; background-color: #ff9999; padding-left: 5px;padding-bottom: 5px; border-top: 1px solid #aaa } a.ai-bold {font-weight: bold;}#ai-layer-div-advanced_iframe p {height:100%;margin:0;padding:0}#ai-div-container-advanced_iframe\r\n       { \r\n           position: relative;\r\n           width: 100%; max-width: 100%;}\r\n       #ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe\r\n       {\r\n          position: absolute;\r\n          z-index:1000;\r\n          margin-left:-33px;\r\n          left: 50%;   top: 150px;\r\n         }} \r\n       #ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe img\r\n       {\r\n          border: none;\r\n       }</style><script type=\"text/javascript\">var ai_iframe_width_advanced_iframe = 0;var ai_iframe_height_advanced_iframe = 0;var aiIsIe8=false;var aiOnloadScrollTop=\"true\";var aiShowDebug=false;\r\n\t\tif (typeof aiReadyCallbacks === 'undefined') {\r\n\t\t\tvar aiReadyCallbacks = [];  \r\n\t\t} else if (!(aiReadyCallbacks instanceof Array)) {\r\n\t\t\tvar aiReadyCallbacks = [];\r\n\t\t}    function aiShowIframeId(id_iframe) { jQuery(\"#\"+id_iframe).css(\"visibility\", \"visible\");    }    function aiResizeIframeHeight(height) { aiResizeIframeHeight(height,advanced_iframe); }    function aiResizeIframeHeightId(height,width,id) {aiResizeIframeHeightById(id,height);}</script><div id=\"ai-div-container-advanced_iframe\"><div id=\"ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-loader-icon\" src=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/plugins/advanced-iframe/img/loader.gif\" title=\"Loading\" alt=\"Loading\"></img></div><iframe id=\"advanced_iframe\"  name=\"advanced_iframe\"  src=\"https://archive.org/stream/devotions-for-the-daughters-of-israel-marcus-heinrich-bresslau-1852#page/74/mode/2up\"  width=\"100%\"  height=\"900\"  frameborder=\"0\"  allowtransparency=\"true\"  loading=\"lazy\"  style=\";width:100%;height:900px;;width:1px;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;\"  allowfullscreen  onload='jQuery(&quot;#ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe&quot;).hide();;jQuery(&quot;#ai-div-loader-global&quot;).hide()' ></iframe></div><script type=\"text/javascript\">var ifrm_advanced_iframe = document.getElementById(\"advanced_iframe\");var hiddenTabsDoneadvanced_iframe = false;\r\nfunction resizeCallbackadvanced_iframe() {}var recalculateIframeResizeadvanced_iframe = 0;\r\n        var recalculateIframeOrientationchangeadvanced_iframe = 0;\r\n        var aiWindowWidth = 0;\r\n\t\tfunction recalculateIframeadvanced_iframe() {\r\n          clearTimeout(recalculateIframeResizeadvanced_iframe);\r\n          clearTimeout(recalculateIframeOrientationchangeadvanced_iframe);}  \r\n        function initResponsiveIframeadvanced_iframe() {\r\n          jQuery(window).resize(function() {\r\n\t\t\t recalculateIframeResizeadvanced_iframe = window.setTimeout(\"recalculateIframeadvanced_iframe()\",100);\r\n          });\r\n          if (window.addEventListener) {\r\n            window.addEventListener(\"orientationchange\", function() {\r\n               recalculateIframeOrientationchangeadvanced_iframe = window.setTimeout(\"recalculateIframeadvanced_iframe()\",100);\r\n            }, false);\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n        aiReadyCallbacks.push(initResponsiveIframeadvanced_iframe);</script><style>#advanced_iframe {width: 1px !important;min-width:100% !important;max-width:100% !important;}</style><script type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
