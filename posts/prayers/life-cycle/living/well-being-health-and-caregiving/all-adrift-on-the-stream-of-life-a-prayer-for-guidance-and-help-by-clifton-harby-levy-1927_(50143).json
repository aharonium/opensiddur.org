            "bio": "Rabbi Clifton Harby Levy (1867–1962), was a Reform rabbi in the United States. Born in New Orleans, he was ordained at Hebrew Union College (1890), served as rabbi of Congregation Gates of Hope, New York City (1890–91), and as superintendent of classes for immigrant children established by the Baron de Hirsch Fund. Levy later served congregations in Lancaster, Pennsylvania (1892–94) and Baltimore, Maryland (1894–96), where he organized a Jewish kindergarten in a religious school and the first United Hebrew Charities. He founded Tremont Temple, Bronx, New York, and was its rabbi from 1906 to 1921. He left the pulpit rabbinate in 1921 and in 1924 organized the Centre of Jewish Science, New York City. As part of the Jewish Science movement, it sought to counter the influence of Christian Science among acculturated American Jews and to inject spirituality into the Reform Jewish synagogue. He was a founding member of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Council_for_Judaism\">American Council for Judaism</a>, which consisted primarily of anti-Zionist Reform rabbis and laymen. While still a student, Levy published a five-act Purim play, <em>Haman and Mordecai</em> (1886). During his stay in Baltimore he edited <em>Jewish Comment</em>. He edited <em>The Bible in Art</em> (1936) and <em>The Bible in Pictures</em> (1942), and served as art editor of the <em>Universal Jewish Encyclopedia</em>.",

    "content": "<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">\n<blockquote><p>I FEEL NERVOUS AND UPSET</p>\n<p>When we feel nervous and out of sorts, this does not mean that anything is really wrong. It does indicate that, for the moment, we have lost self-control, and lack the great joyous feeling of interest in life. We need not indulge the spasm of hopelessness, but must counteract it by action. </p>\n<p>The simplest method is first to relax every muscle, clear the mind by letting it lie fallow, without concentrating upon anything. Then gradually allow the sense of peace, comfort, courage to seep down from the central mind into the subconscious. We repeat to ourselves some of the finest and most stimulating words of Psalmist and Prophet. “The Lord is with me, why should I fear?” “Help me, O Lord, and I shall be helped; heal me and I shall be healed!’ </p>\n<p>Now taking a new, fresh hold upon our problem, we see it clearly, and try to find a wise solution. If I am troubled about material matters, I begin to work, and perhaps consult some friend, who may advise me to advantage. But I do not allow myself to sit and worry, or excuse myself by saying: “I can’t help it, everything is going wrong.” It goes wrong only because we do not work quietly, hopefully and sanely to make it right. </p>\n<p>If I quiet myself first, I am then ready to see clearly and to judge fairly, and find it not nearly so bad as it seemed when I was depressed. There is always a right way out and I prove my Spirit-power by finding this way. It is a mistake for me to think that every one is against me. The fact is that many are ready to aid all who try to help themselves by hard work and courageous effort. </p>\n<p>No one can perturb me so long as I am quiet within, and that is a matter of self-control, enforced by my own Spiritual advancement. I know that nothing is worth worrying about, being angry over, or becoming excited over. Then I possess my soul in patience and calmly await the issue, working my way towards the end I have in view, confident that I shall attain as much as I deserve and more, because of the aid of God. I am certain of that help, because it has come to every one who sought it Spiritually, and directly. I am working in accordance with the will of God as expressed in the laws of life. And I feel that the help of God is ever present, so that I may face every issue of life, coolly, courageously, and sure of the added power that comes from God alone.</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto;
