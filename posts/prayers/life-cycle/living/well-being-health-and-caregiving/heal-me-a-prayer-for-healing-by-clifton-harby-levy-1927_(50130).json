            "bio": "Rabbi Clifton Harby Levy (1867–1962), was a Reform rabbi in the United States. Born in New Orleans, he was ordained at Hebrew Union College (1890), served as rabbi of Congregation Gates of Hope, New York City (1890–91), and as superintendent of classes for immigrant children established by the Baron de Hirsch Fund. Levy later served congregations in Lancaster, Pennsylvania (1892–94) and Baltimore, Maryland (1894–96), where he organized a Jewish kindergarten in a religious school and the first United Hebrew Charities. He founded Tremont Temple, Bronx, New York, and was its rabbi from 1906 to 1921. He left the pulpit rabbinate in 1921 and in 1924 organized the Centre of Jewish Science, New York City. As part of the Jewish Science movement, it sought to counter the influence of Christian Science among acculturated American Jews and to inject spirituality into the Reform Jewish synagogue. He was a founding member of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Council_for_Judaism\">American Council for Judaism</a>, which consisted primarily of anti-Zionist Reform rabbis and laymen. While still a student, Levy published a five-act Purim play, <em>Haman and Mordecai</em> (1886). During his stay in Baltimore he edited <em>Jewish Comment</em>. He edited <em>The Bible in Art</em> (1936) and <em>The Bible in Pictures</em> (1942), and served as art editor of the <em>Universal Jewish Encyclopedia</em>.",

    "content": "<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">\n<blockquote><p>I SEEK HEALTH AND HEALING </p>\n<p>The real <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Science\">Jewish Scientist</a>, knowing that the human being is physical, mental and Spiritual, does not ignore the material, or the body, but cooperates with the physician, or surgeon, welcoming his aid, and working with him. We do not fight against his care, but welcome it, and by our desire to cooperate we aid in securing the results for which the wise physician is working. </p>\n<p>We relax when he dresses a wound, and in that way suffer a minimum of pain. We fill ourselves with the great trust in the physician as one helper and in God as the only Healer. We know that all healing comes from within, through the power and willing aid of God, and are grateful to any one who helps us back to the normal state of self-control, by which we can aid ourselves through the power of God. </p>\n<p>I relax every muscle and nerve in a quiet place, clear my mind, and let the sense of peace permeate every pore. I exert the Spiritual power within me, filling my consciousness with the complete reliance upon God, resting upon my full consciousness of God’s indwelling power. We aid this consciousness as we repeat the wondrous promises of Prophet and Psalmist, having in mind Jeremiah’s assertion of faith: “Heal me, O Lord, and I shall be healed; save me, O Lord, and I shall be saved!” We add to this numerous suggestions of God’s willingness to help us, as we find them scattered through Scripture. We repeat that thought of Psalms 23: “Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me; Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me.” What infinite strength and comfort lies in that consciousness of the ever ready help of God, what courage wells up in our souls, how quietly we rest awaiting the healing that comes with faith and earnest hope! </p>\n<p>We drive out all fear by our infinite trust in God. We know that all is well because we are certain of the aid of Almighty God, ever loving to those who seek Him in spirit and in truth. If we suffer, we know that it too is but for a time, and that ease and peace will come the sooner for our reliance upon God. We rule through the Spirit, which is of God, and soon all will be well, and we shall be happy, painless, ready to live and work with courage and trust.</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<hr />\n\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto;
