            "bio": "Rabbi Dr. Israel Mowshowitz (1914–1991), born in Poland was an Orthodox rabbi in the United States. He emigrated with his family in 1929, attended Yeshiva University for his undergraduate degree and was ordained at its Rabbi Yitzhak Elchanan Theological Seminary in 1937. He earned a Ph.D. in psychology from Duke University and Yeshiva University awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1966. He served synagogues affiliated with the Conservative movement, first in Durham, North Carolina, and then at Omaha, Nebraska. In 1949, he was appointed rabbi of Hillcrest Jewish Center in Queens, New York, becoming rabbi emeritus in 1983. Respected in both the Orthodox and Conservative movements, Mowshowitz rose to become arguably the most prominent Jewish communal leader in New York. He was a founder of the International Synagogue at Kennedy International Airport and served as its honorary president. He also served on the boards of numerous charitable, interfaith, and interracial organizations in New York. He was active in the American civil rights movement and joined Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in his march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, in March 1965. Mowshowitz helped establish Crossroads Africa, a pilot project that was a forerunner of the Peace Corps. In the 1960s, Mowshowitz was the president of the New York Board of Rabbis, and in that capacity, became a nationally quoted spokesman on political and social issues impacting Jewish interests. New York Governor Mario M. Cuomo, a Roman Catholic called Mowshowitz \"my rabbi.\" He held the title of special assistant for community affairs in the governor's office, where he negotiated issues between the state and religious groups. According to Israel Miller, head of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, \"[Mowshowitz] was the one all of us would call when we needed something done of a political nature.\" Mowshowitz traveled throughout the world on behalf of Jewish causes. In 1956, he was a member of one of the first delegations of rabbis to visit the Soviet Union to investigate the conditions of Soviet Jewry. He also traveled to Poland, South Africa, Iran, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and other countries on similar missions, including a study trip to 13 countries with the National Conference of Christians and Jews. The New York Board of Rabbis established the annual Rabbi Israel and Libby Mowshowitz Award, to honor both them and rabbis who excel in public service. He wrote two books, <em>Fires to Warm Us</em> (1978) and <em>To Serve in Faithfulness</em> (1975). With Debra Orenstein he co-authored, <em>From Generation to Generation</em> (1992).",

Specially designed chapel buildings were established for Jewish, Catholic, and Protestant religious groups across from the International Arrivals building at the JFK Airport. Benedictions were made by the chaplain responsible for each room: Rev. Dr. G. Barrett Rich, Ⅲ (Protestant); and Right Reverend Monsignor Francis X. Fitzgibbon (Catholic). Also speaking at the dedication was Hubert H. Humphrey, Vice President of the United States; and Samuel F. Pryor, chairman of the joint campaign to raise $1-million for the work establishing the plaza. The transcription was made from a taped recording of the event, a copy of which is held at the <a href=\"https://www2.mnhs.org/library/findaids/00442/pdfa/00442-02083.pdf\">Minnesota Historical Society</a>. Rabbi Mowshowitz&#8217;s benediction appears on the final page (p. 15) of this transcript. Many thanks to Howard Mortman for bringing this prayer to our attention.</p>\n<p>The history of the Tri-Faith Chapel Plaza was shortlived. All three chapels were demolished in 1989 and new prayer spaces were incorporated into the International Arrivals Terminal building. From the &#8220;<a href=\"https://internationalsynagogue.org/history/\">History of the Chapel</a> at the International Synagogue at JFK website:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In 1988, the independent chapels were taken over by the right of eminent domain to make way for runway expansion and the Port Authority decided to incorporate the chapels within the International Arrivals Building. Since it was inconvenient for passengers and employees to reach the chapels by foot from the terminals the three buildings were torn down to be re-located within the new main building. From 1988 until 2001, the three faith groups shared one temporary chapel on the second floor while construction was taking place. Presently, there are four chapels (a Multi-Faith chapel was added,) side by side, on the fourth floor of the International Arrivals Terminal. Each chapel accommodates approximately fifty people.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Source(s)</h3>\n<p><span style=\"float: right;\"><div id=\"attachment_65243\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/israel-mowshowitz-at-the-jfk-airport-dedication-18-december-1966-p--15.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65243\" src=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/israel-mowshowitz-at-the-jfk-airport-dedication-18-december-1966-p--15-250x250.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-65243\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-65243\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Israel Mowshowitz at the JFK Airport Tri-Faith Chapels Plaza dedication (18 December 1966), p. 15</p></div></span> <span style=\"float: left;\"><div id=\"attachment_65248\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/synagogue-interior-at-tri-faith-plaza.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65248\" src=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/synagogue-interior-at-tri-faith-plaza-250x250.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-65248\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-65248\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">synagogue interior at Tri-Faith Chapels Plaza</p></div></span> <span style=\"float: left;\"><div id=\"attachment_65249\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tri-faith-plaza-from-air.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65249\" src=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tri-faith-plaza-from-air-250x250.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-65249\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-65249\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tri-Faith Chapels Plaza (from the air over JFK airport)</p></div></span> <span style=\"float: left;\"><div id=\"attachment_65253\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tri-faith-chapels-plaza-postcard.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65253\" src=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tri-faith-chapels-plaza-postcard-250x250.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-65253\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-65253\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tri-Faith Chapels Plaza postcard</p></div></span><span class=\"\" style=\"display:block;clear:both;height: 0px;margin-top: ;border-top-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;\"></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"speaker-mute footnotes_reference_container\"> <div class=\"footnote_container_prepare\"><p><span role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"footnote_reference_container_label pointer\" onclick=\"footnote_expand_collapse_reference_container__1();\">Notes</span><span role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"footnote_reference_container_collapse_button\" style=\"display: none;;
