In 1859, after seven years as the rabbi of <a href=\"/profile/kehilat-kadosh-beth-elohim/\">Ḳ.Ḳ. Beth Elohim</a> in Charleston, South Carolina, he returned in poor health to New York where he contributed frequently to the Jewish press, and translated various German works into English: Rabbi Samuel Adler's catechism, Abraham Geiger's lectures on Jewish history, and Ludwig Philipson's pamphlet, <em>Haben die Juden Jesum Gekreuzigt?</em> (the Crucifixion from the Jewish Point of View), et al. In 1866, a number of his English translations of Fanny Neuda's teḥinot in German (from her <em>Stunden Der Andacht</em>, 1855/1858) were published in a volume he titled <em>Hours of Devotion</em>. The work also included a number of his own prayers as well as those of Marcus Heinrich Bresslau. The following year, Moritz Mayer passed away. He was 45 years old. \r\n\r\n(We are indebted to Anton Hieke for his research on Mayer, \"<a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/41728357/Anton_Hieke_Rabbi_Maurice_Mayer_German_Revolutionary_Charleston_Reformer_and_Anti-Abolitionist\">Rabbi Maurice Mayer: German Revolutionary, Charleston Reformer, and Anti-Abolitionist</a>\" published in <em>Southern Jewish Life</em>, 17 (2014), pp. 45-89.)\r\n\r\nFor Mayer's translations of prayers by other authors, please <a href=\"/profile/moritz-mayer-translation/\">visit here</a>.",

God of life, gracious Protector in all dangers! With devout heart I invoke Thine almighty protection upon my beloved husband. His avocations and duties have removed him from me, the sacred duty of maintaining and supporting his family have called him away from his home. O Lord! do Thou protect him in all his ways! Do Thou preserve his health and life, strengthen and inspire him, that he may not succumb to the labors and troubles of his avocation. Remove far from him all trials and dangers wherewith journeys are usually beset. Guard him against all mischances, that cunning and malice, falsehood and deceit may devise for him. O grant! that he may find favor in the eyes of all men, and vouchsafe Thy blessing unto all that he may undertake, that his sojourn in a foreign land may be unto our benefit and happiness. Oh! bring him back unto me, unto his home, full of health and cheerfulness, and I will at all times thank Thee, and praise Thy holy name for evermore. <em>Amen</em>.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<p>&#8220;A wife&#8217;s prayer whose husband is on a journey&#8221; is one of thirty prayers appearing in Rabbi Moritz Mayer&#8217;s collection of tehinot, <em>Hours of Devotion</em> (1866), of uncertain provenance and which he may have written. &#8211;Aharon Varady</p>\n<h3>Source(s)</h3>\n<style>\n       .errordiv { padding:10px; margin:10px; border: 1px solid #555555;color: #000000;background-color: #f8f8f8; width:500px; }#advanced_iframe {visibility:visible;opacity:1;vertical-align:top;}.ai-info-bottom-iframe { position: fixed; z-index: 10000; bottom:0; left: 0; margin: 0px; text-align: center; width: 100%; background-color: #ff9999; padding-left: 5px;padding-bottom: 5px; border-top: 1px solid #aaa } a.ai-bold {font-weight: bold;}#ai-layer-div-advanced_iframe p {height:100%;margin:0;padding:0}#ai-div-container-advanced_iframe\n       {\n           position: relative;\n           width: 100%; max-width: 100%;}\n       #ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe\n       {\n          position: absolute;\n          z-index:1000;\n          margin-left:-33px;\n          left: 50%;   top: 150px;\n         }}\n       #ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe img\n       {\n          border: none;\n       }</style><script type=\"text/javascript\">var ai_iframe_width_advanced_iframe = 0;var ai_iframe_height_advanced_iframe = 0;var aiIsIe8=false;var aiOnloadScrollTop=\"true\";var aiShowDebug=false;\n\t\tif (typeof aiReadyCallbacks === 'undefined') {\n\t\t\tvar aiReadyCallbacks = [];\n\t\t} else if (!(aiReadyCallbacks instanceof Array)) {\n\t\t\tvar aiReadyCallbacks = [];\n\t\t}    function aiShowIframeId(id_iframe) { jQuery(\"#\"+id_iframe).css(\"visibility\", \"visible\");    }    function aiResizeIframeHeight(height) { aiResizeIframeHeight(height,advanced_iframe); }    function aiResizeIframeHeightId(height,width,id) {aiResizeIframeHeightById(id,height);}</script><div id=\"ai-div-container-advanced_iframe\"><div id=\"ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-loader-icon\" src=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/plugins/advanced-iframe/img/loader.gif\" title=\"Loading\" alt=\"Loading\" /></div><iframe id=\"advanced_iframe\"  name=\"advanced_iframe\"  src=\"https://archive.org/stream/hoursofdevotionb00neudrich#page/86/mode/2up\"  width=\"100%\"  height=\"900\"  frameborder=\"0\"  border=\"0\"  allowtransparency=\"true\"  loading=\"lazy\"  style=\";width:100%;height:900px;;width:1px;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;\"  allowfullscreen  onload='jQuery(&quot;#ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe&quot;).hide();;jQuery(&quot;#ai-div-loader-global&quot;).hide()' ></iframe></div><script type=\"text/javascript\">var ifrm_advanced_iframe = document.getElementById(\"advanced_iframe\");var hiddenTabsDoneadvanced_iframe = false;\nfunction resizeCallbackadvanced_iframe() {}var recalculateIframeResizeadvanced_iframe = 0;\n        var recalculateIframeOrientationchangeadvanced_iframe = 0;\n        var aiWindowWidth = 0;\n\t\tfunction recalculateIframeadvanced_iframe() {\n          clearTimeout(recalculateIframeResizeadvanced_iframe);\n          clearTimeout(recalculateIframeOrientationchangeadvanced_iframe);}\n        function initResponsiveIframeadvanced_iframe() {\n          jQuery(window).resize(function() {\n\t\t\t recalculateIframeResizeadvanced_iframe = window.setTimeout(\"recalculateIframeadvanced_iframe()\",100);\n          });\n          if (window.addEventListener) {\n            window.addEventListener(\"orientationchange\", function() {\n               recalculateIframeOrientationchangeadvanced_iframe = window.setTimeout(\"recalculateIframeadvanced_iframe()\",100);\n            }, false);\n          }\n        }\n        aiReadyCallbacks.push(initResponsiveIframeadvanced_iframe);</script><style>#advanced_iframe {width: 1px !important;min-width:100% !important;max-width:100% !important;}</style><script type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
