            "bio": "The Aronin family are Kohanim, descendents of Aaron, brother of Moses and the first Kohen Gadol (high priest). Family legend claims descent from Simon the Just, one of the Great Sages. The symbolism of the crest recalls this history. The Aleph stands for the Aronin name. The shape of the crest represents the mitre (headpiece) of the Kohen Gadol. The three letters—Taf, Ayin and Gimel—stand for Torah, Avodah, Gemilot Chasadim (law, divine service, and good deeds), the three pillars upon which the world rests, according to Simon the Just in Pirke Avot. The three red stones represent these pillars and the large stone, the world. (The stones also recall the breastplate worn by the Kohen Gadol, which had four rows of three stones representing the twelve tribes of Israel.) The Aronin rabbis of Eastern Europe wore a signet ring bearing the Aronin crest, which was used as an official seal by dipping the ring in wax. Ben Aronin used a picture of the crest on his stationery.",

The Chicago Jewish Historical Society dubbed him \"the Chicago Jewish community’s quintessential Renaissance Man...a lawyer, scholar, teacher, writer, summer camp counselor, and for many years director of extension activities at Anshe Emet. He wrote Jewish-themed songs and plays which are still performed today.\" He appeared as Uncle Ben in the <em>Magic Door</em> series for children; as an author, he began publishing work of genre interest with \"The Doubt\" for Amazing in May 1932, and who wrote the Raphael Drale sequence of Lost Race tales about the Lost Tribes of Israel, comprising <em>The Lost Tribe: Being the Strange Adventures of Raphael Drale in Search of the Lost Tribes of Israel</em> (1934) and <em>Cavern of Destiny</em> (1943). In 1941, his <em>The Abramiad</em>, a book-length mythological poem on the emergence of the Jewish people, was published by Argus Books.",

was shared by the loving family of Ben Aronin. The poem may have been printed elsewhere during Aronin&#8217;s lifetime (please let us know), but as far as we can tell, it has been first published here, online, through the Open Siddur Project.  I have added line breaks to his psalm, separating the poem into stanzas.</p>\n<p>Aronin&#8217;s reference to &#8220;the beauty of each blade of grass,&#8221; invoked in the first stanza, is a powerful one given that the mitsvah of bal tashḥit <a href=\"https://aharon.varady.net/omphalos/2012/02/on-a-pedagogy-for-teaching-bal-tash%e1%b8%a5it-variations-on-being-mindful-not-to-absently-pluck-the-leaves-of-living-plants\">was once emphasized to children</a> through stories concerning not idly plucking vegetation &#8212; blades of grass and leaves of trees. Aronin is also remembered by his secretary Mrs. Shirr, for saying &#8220;I believe God knows every leaf that falls.&#8221; That Ben received a ḥassidic appreciation for the vitality of all living creatures including vegetation seems quite plausible as Aronin&#8217;s father Simon (1877-1938), also referred to in the poem, &#8220;studied with Rabbi [Shalom DovBer] Schneerson in the Lubavitcher Yeshiva&#8221; (Jeffrey Conn. &#8220;<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/BenAroninManAuthorTeacherJeffreyConn1990\">Ben Aronin, Man, Author, and Teacher</a>,&#8221; Masters thesis: Spertus College, 1990, p.5). The sixth rebbe of ḤaBaD (Yosef Yitshak Schneerson) recounts his father Shalom DovBer (the fifth rebbe of ḤaBaD) teaching him this very lesson. The first Lubavitch yeshivah, <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3771094/jewish/From-Lubavitch-to-Shanghai-The-History-of-Tomchei-Temimim-in-11-Images.htm\">Tomchei Tmimim</a> founded by Shalom DovBer, opened its doors in 1897 in the town of Lubavitch, in those days part of White Russia, Belarus. </p>\n<p>Both Simon and his wife, Rose, came from “Dokschitz in the Vilna Region,” a town north of Minsk. Simon&#8217;s father, R&#8217; Aryeh Loeb Aronin (1849-1931), was a student of Rabbi <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzchak_Elchanan_Spektor\">Yitzhok Elkanon Spector</a>. After serving as rabbi in both Barisev and Krasnaluk, Lithuania, Aryeh Loeb emigrated first to Baltimore and then to Sheboygan, Wisconsin where Simon and Rose eventually joined them in 1902. The childhood reminiscence of Ben Aronin in this poem is of his childhood in Sheboygan, Green Bay, and Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin. </p>\n<p>Undated, the poem must have been written after 1944 when Ben Aronin turned 40 years old and made a dramatic shift in his career from a criminal lawyer to a children&#8217;s educator and author. This article from the Chicago Tribune in 1944 documents his career change. Ben&#8217;s reference to blades of grass might also recall Walt Whitman&#8217;s <em>Blades of Grass</em>; Whitman served as the subject of Aronin&#8217;s last novel, a work of secular historical fiction, <em>Walt Whitman&#8217;s Secret</em> (1955). </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_23534\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Lawyer-to-Quit-and-Become-Author-Chicago-Tribune-1944.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-23534\" src=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Lawyer-to-Quit-and-Become-Author-Chicago-Tribune-1944-300x293.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"293\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-23534\" srcset=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Lawyer-to-Quit-and-Become-Author-Chicago-Tribune-1944-300x293.jpg 300w, https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Lawyer-to-Quit-and-Become-Author-Chicago-Tribune-1944.jpg 745w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-23534\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lawyer to Quit and Become Author (Chicago Tribune 1944)</p></div>\n<p>We are indebted to the Aronin family for sharing this poem and the research materials referenced above.</p>\n<h3>Source(s)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Psalm-of-Gratitude-Ben-Aronin-undated.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Click to access Psalm-of-Gratitude-Ben-Aronin-undated.pdf</a></p>\n",
