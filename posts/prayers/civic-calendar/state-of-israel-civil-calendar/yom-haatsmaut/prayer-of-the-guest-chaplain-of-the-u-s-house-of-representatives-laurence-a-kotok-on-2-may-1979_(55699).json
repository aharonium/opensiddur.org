Jerome Ambro (D-NY)<br />\nDate of Prayer: 2 May 1979</p>\n<p><!-- --></p>\n<blockquote><p>\nMr. AMBRO. Mr. Speaker, it is my great privilege and pleasure this afternoon to introduce Rabbi Laurence A. Kotok to my colleagues here in the House of Representatives. Rabbi Kotok is the spiritual leader of the North Country Reform Temple in Glen Cove, N.Y.</p>\n<p>A native of West Orange, N.J., Rabbi Kotok received his B.A. degree from Rutgers University in 1967. He then attended Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati where he received his ordination and an MHL degree in 1972. He served as an assistant rabbi in Temple Sinai in Roslyn Heights, N.Y., before coming to the North Country Reform Temple in 1974.</p>\n<p>Active in the Long Island religious community, Rabbi Kotok is the incoming president of the Long Island Association of Reform Rabbis, vice president of the Long Island Board of Rabbis, chairman of the Glen Cove Jewish Presidents Council, and a board member of the National Religious School Committee of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations’ Commission of Jewish Education, among many other affiliations.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Kotok has a long history of involvement in the social concerns of the secular community dating back to his student days and continuing to the present time. Since coming to Long Island, he has immersed himself in the totality of the community, serving first as the vice president of the Roslyn Ministerial Association, and then as president of the Glen Cove Inter-Agency Council—an umbrella agency for numerous social action and human needs organizations—as a board member of the Senior Health and Counseling Inter-Agency Council, on the Glen Cove Community Development Advisory Board, just to name a few. In all of these positions, Rabbi Kotok has worked with unceasing and selfless dedication to add dignity and hope to the lives of the less fortunate citizens of his community.</p>\n<p>Mr. Speaker, there is not a Member of this House who is not aware that today we celebrate the 31st anniversary of the modern State of Israel. That celebration, both joyous and solemn, has been fittingly initiated this afternoon by Rabbi Kotok’s meaningful and inspiring invocation. I know that as the session unfolds, many of my colleagues will join me here on the House floor to commemorate this auspicious occasion and to wish a hearty “Mazel Tov” to our good friends in Israel during this birthday celebration.</p>\n<p>At this moment, as we begin the day’s session, I am proud, on behalf of all of the Members of the House of Representatives, to welcome Rabbi Kotok, his charming wife, family, and the members of his congregation to our midst.\n</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable toggleable-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"x\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"/translate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contribute&nbsp;a&nbsp;translation</a></th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Source (English)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\nאלהינו ואלהי אבותינו\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<span class=\"divine-referent\">Our God</span> and <span class=\"divine-referent\">God of all generations</span>.<br />\n<span class=\"divine-referent\">God</span> of peace and understanding,<br />\n<span class=\"divine-referent\">source of life and blessing</span>.<br />\nWe stand this day<br />\ntorn between conflicting emotions,<br />\nbetween sorrow and joy.<br />\nSorrow as we have just observed Yom HaShoah—<br />\nthe day of memorial<br />\nfor the six million Jews<br />\nand five million Christians<br />\nwho were the victims of the Holocaust.<br />\nAnd yet we feel joy<br />\nas today we celebrate Israel Independence Day,<br />\nthis the 31st anniversary of the State of Israel<br />\nreborn out of the ashes and destruction of the Holocaust.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nWe pray this day<br />\nthat our world will never again allow<br />\nthe horror of the Holocaust.<br />\nThat Israel and her people<br />\nmay experience the blessings<br />\nof peace and security,<br />\nshared within the community<br />\nof democratic ideals and dreams.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nMay we as members of a world community<br />\nhave the strength and understanding<br />\nto not only speak of peace,<br />\nbut truly take an active role<br />\nin the creation of peace.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nWe pray that these United States<br />\nwill continue to be a beacon of hope and peace,<br />\nand that we might have the fortitude and commitment<br />\nto sacrifice and to strive for that freedom<br />\nthat allows peace to exist in our world.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\nכן יהי רצון<br />\nאמן\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nThus may it be so.<br />\n<em>Amen</em>.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<p>This prayer of the guest chaplain was offered in the fourth month of the first session of the 96th US Congress in the House of Representatives, and published in the <em>Congressional Record</em>, vol. 125, part 8 (2 May 1979), p. 9527.
