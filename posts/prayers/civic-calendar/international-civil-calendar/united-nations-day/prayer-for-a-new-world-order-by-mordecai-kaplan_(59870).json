Or to be more precise our prayers should help us focus on our ideals and the goals that we should hold in the forefront of our consciousness.</p>\n<p>I found this prayer many years ago and do not know when Kaplan crafted it. He was continuously conscious of the need for cooperation in international affairs rather than the assertion of power. The fundamental commitment to cooperation comes out not only in times of war but at all times. So much of what is happening reflects a meanness of spirit. Kaplan here arouses our spirit of generosity and concern. &#8211;Mel Scult\n</p></div>\n<hr />\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable toggleable-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"x\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"/translate/\" target=\"_blank\">Contribute&nbsp;a&nbsp;translation</a></th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Source (English)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nMay the consciousness of human solidarity<br />\npenetrate the minds and hearts of all men.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nMay the nations that are strong help those that are weak,<br />\nand those that are rich in territories and possessions<br />\nuphold those that are poor in knowledge and resources.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nLet us no longer look to force and violence.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nLet the conscience of the world be aroused<br />\nagainst deeds of cruelty and oppression.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n</div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\nLet the people&#8217;s of the world<br />\nurge their governments<br />\nto cease acts of injustice and plunder<br />\nand to act justly and righteously.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<p>This prayer for a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_world_order_(politics)\">new world order</a> by Rabbi Dr. Mordecai Kaplan, representing many of the hopes of a League of Nations after World War Ⅰ and a more robust United Nations after World War Ⅱ, was found by Mel Scult among Mordecai Kaplan&#8217;s papers and shared by Dr. Scult in a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/109461982515710/posts/8795316010596887/\">Facebook post</a>.
