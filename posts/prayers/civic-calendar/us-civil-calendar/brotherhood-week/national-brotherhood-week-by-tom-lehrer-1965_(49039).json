            "bio": "Thomas Andrew Lehrer (born 9 April 1928) is an American musician, singer-songwriter, satirist, and mathematician, who later taught mathematics and musical theater. He recorded pithy and humorous songs that became popular in the 1950s and 1960s. His songs often parodied popular musical forms, though they usually had original melodies. Lehrer's early performances dealt with non-topical subjects and dark humor in songs such as \"Poisoning Pigeons in the Park\". In the 1960s, he produced songs about timely social and political issues, particularly for the U.S. version of the television show <em>That Was the Week That Was</em>. The popularity of these songs has far outlasted their topical subjects and references. Lehrer quoted a friend's explanation: \"Always predict the worst and you'll be hailed as a prophet.\" In the early 1970s, Lehrer largely retired from public performance to devote his time to teaching mathematics and musical theater history at the University of California, Santa Cruz.",

National Brotherhood Week in February was first established in the 1930s by the National Conference of Christians and Jews as a means of promoting the values of inter-religious tolerance and civic interdependence. The week gained federal support from President Franklin Roosevelt during World War Ⅱ as a means of combatting fascist and nativist objections to a vision of democracy built on the foundation of a multicultural civil society. By the time Tom Lehrer lampooned the civic commemoration in 1965, the McCarthyite oppressions of the Red Scare and Lavender Scare during the Cold War, the manufactured Vietnam War, lingering anti-Semitic prejudice and suspicion, the continued struggle for civil rights with its continued lynchings, the assassination of JFK and increasing political violence had all exposed National Brotherhood Week for many young adults as <em>phony</em>, a historical relic that had lost the import of any cultural imperative it might have once possessed. . . .",

I feel very strongly that if anything has been proven by the past decade, it is that antifascist civic values undergirding our democratic civil society require continued, enduring promotion. If Tom Lehrer showed us anything through his jaunty takedown, it is that such civic values need to register as genuine and authentic if they are not to be watered down to the point of irrelevance. &#8211;Aharon Varady</p>\n<h3>Recordings</h3>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CgASBVMyVFI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=18&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<h3>Source(s)</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_49043\" style=\"width: 241px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/National-Brotherhood-Week-lyrics-Tom-Lehrer-1965.jpg_Page_1_Image_0001.png\" rel=\"lightbox-0\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-49043\" src=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/National-Brotherhood-Week-lyrics-Tom-Lehrer-1965.jpg_Page_1_Image_0001-231x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"231\" height=\"300\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-49043\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-49043\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"https://tomlehrersongs.com/824-2/\">National Brotherhood Week lyrics</a> (Tom Lehrer 1965)</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"speaker-mute footnotes_reference_container\"> <div class=\"footnote_container_prepare\"><p><span role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"footnote_reference_container_label pointer\" onclick=\"footnote_expand_collapse_reference_container__1();\">Notes</span><span role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"footnote_reference_container_collapse_button\" style=\"display: none;\" onclick=\"footnote_expand_collapse_reference_container__1();\">[<a id=\"footnote_reference_container_collapse_button__1\">+</a>]</span></p></div> <div id=\"footnote_references_container__1\" style=\"\"><table class=\"footnotes_table footnote-reference-container\"><caption class=\"accessibility\">Notes</caption> <tbody> \r\n\r\n<tr class=\"footnotes_plugin_reference_row\"> <th scope=\"row\" id=\"footnote_plugin_reference__1_1\" class=\"footnote_plugin_index pointer\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor__1('footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_1');\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"footnote_plugin_link\" >1</a></th> <td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">&#8221;Cassius Clay and Mrs. Wallace,&#8221; according to this <a href=\"https://youtu.be/CgASBVMyVFI?t=18\">1967 performance</a>.
