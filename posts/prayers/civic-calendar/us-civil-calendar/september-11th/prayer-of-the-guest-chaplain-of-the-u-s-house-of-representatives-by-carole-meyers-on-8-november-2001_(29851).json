She became the rabbi of Temple Sinai of Glendale in 1986, when she was 29. She resigned in 2001, and died in 2007 of bone cancer. Posthumously, a book of her sermons was published, titled <em>Leaning on God: Sermons</em> (2018). She first became interested in becoming a rabbi after her father died when she was 13 and her stepfather died when she was 19, and the rituals and community support of the synagogue helped her through her grief.",

Mr. Speaker, I would like to join in welcoming today&#8217;s distinguished guest chaplain, Rabbi Carole Meyers, and thank her for leading the House in prayer. As Rabbi Emerita of Temple Sinai in Glendale, California, Rabbi Meyers has distinguished herself as a community leader.</p>\n<p>Over the past 15 years, Rabbi Meyers has served at Glendale&#8217;s Temple Sinai, one of the most thriving synagogues in the area. During her tenure at Temple Sinai, the congregation nearly doubled in size, boosting its education programs for both children and adults.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Meyers significantly raised the profile of the temple through her extensive community involvement. Over the past few years, Rabbi Meyers has been involved with Habitat for Humanity and the Glendale Community Foundation. She served on the Mayor&#8217;s Task Force on Hate Crimes, helping to craft a citywide response plan to hate crimes. Rabbi Meyers also trained as a chaplain for the Glendale Police Department and helped to create an annual AIDS Awareness Prayer Service with other Glendale religious leaders.</p>\n<p>Though Rabbi Meyers retired this past June in order to devote more time to her family, her influence on her community can still be felt. Today, especially in this time of national tragedy, the warmth of her words have indeed found a new meaning.</p>\n<p>We are all proud to welcome Rabbi Meyers here today as a guest chaplain.\n</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<hr />\n\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable toggleable-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"x\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"/translate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contribute a translation</a></th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Source (English)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\">\nI am honored to be here this morning<br />\nwith you courageous leaders of our country<br />\nto join together in prayer.<br />\nIt takes courage<br />\nto pray meaningfully<br />\nin the wake of events shaping our lives.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\">\nIt is not that we do not turn to God,<br />\nwe do.<br />\nWe come with our praise<br />\nand with our entreaties,<br />\nbut we strain to hear an answer,<br />\nto sense God&#8217;s presence radiating back to us,<br />\nover the abyss that grief and fear have created.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\">\nShall we this morning,<br />\njust for a moment,<br />\nstop speaking to God,<br />\nasking God, about God,<br />\nentreating God,<br />\nand instead make an effort<br />\nto find once again<br />\nthat experience of God&#8217;s presence<br />\nthat grounds our faith.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\">\nCome with me to that place.<br />\nPerhaps it was when you witnessed<br />\nthe birth of your child,<br />\nnew life so precious and pure,<br />\nperhaps when you saw your soul reflected back at you<br />\nin the eyes of someone whose love was infinite.<br />\nPerhaps in the tangle of pain and darkness<br />\nwhen somehow there was a presence to call,<br />\nto let you know you would move forward.<br />\nPerhaps when a piece of music<br />\nshook you to your core,<br />\nbringing an exquisite awareness<br />\nof the depth of human experience.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\">\nPerhaps when you truly saw<br />\nthe miracle of nature surrounding us,<br />\nthe sun rising and setting,<br />\nday after day of nature in its magnificent order,<br />\nthere was a moment when you knew that an Other exists<br />\n before whom we stand in awe<br />\n and whose greatness we strive to reflect<br />\n in the actions of our lives.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\">\n<p></span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\">\nEternal God,<br />\nbe with us as we move through this time of uncertainty.<br />\nHelp us know<br />\nthat we can lend Your presence<br />\nand use our lives to reflect it.<br />\nThen we will have the faith<br />\nto bring light and joy,<br />\npeace and comfort,<br />\njustice and goodness<br />\nto this magnificent world<br />\nGod has created.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"he\">\nאָמֵן׃<br />\n</span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"en\">\n<em>Amen</em>.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<p>Upon her death, Rep Adam Schiff delivered the following remarks into the Congressional Record, <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/15/extensions-of-remarks-section/article/e2127-2\">Monday, October 15, 2007</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Mr. SCHIFF.
