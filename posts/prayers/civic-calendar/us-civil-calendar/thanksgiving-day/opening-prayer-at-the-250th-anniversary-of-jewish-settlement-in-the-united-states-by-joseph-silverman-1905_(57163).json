            "bio": "Rabbi Joseph Silverman (1860 – 1930), born in Cincinnati, Ohio, was a prominent Reform movement rabbi and author in the United States. He attended the University of Cincinnati and received a Doctor of Divinity from the Hebrew Union College in 1887, from which he received his rabbinic ordination three years earlier. He was Rabbi of Temple Emanu-El, Dallas, Texas, September 1884 to June 1885; rabbi of Congregation B'nai Israel, Galveston, Texas July, 1885 to February 20, 1888. While in Texas he was a circuit preacher to the Jewish communities in the vicinity of Dallas and Galveston, and aided in organizing many Sabbath schools and congregations. At the beginning of 1888, Silverman received an offer from Temple Emanu-El in New York City to serve as a rabbi of the leading Reform congregation in America. Silverman started at Temple Emanu-El on March 1, 1888, succeeding rabbi Gustav Gottheil. He was the first American born rabbi to serve in New York City. During the years of his career in New York, 1888-1922 he was also president (1900–1903) of the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the Eastern Council 1918- and was founder and president of the Emanu-El Brotherhood. He helped organize the Religious Congress of the World's Fair in Chicago, 1893, where his address on this occasion was titled, \"The Popular Errors About the Jews.\" Silverman published many articles and books, including <em>A Catechism on Judaism</em> (1886) and <em>The Renaissance of Judaism</em> (1918). He was consulting editor of the Jewish Encyclopedia (Funk &amp; Wagnalls). An article from The New York Times on April 21, 1912, quoted Silverman at a memorial service for victims of the RMS Titanic disaster as saying \"Not God was responsible for this great disaster but the imperfection of human knowledge and judgment.\"",

settlement of the Jews in the United States, 1655-1905,&#8221; at Carnegie Hall, New York City, Thanksgiving Day, 30 November 1905. The prayer was published in the 14th issue of the <em>Publications Of The American Jewish Historical Society</em> (1906) and in a book <em>The two hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the settlement of the Jews in the United States, 1655-1905</em>, also published that same year by the AJHS. </p>\n<p>On 22 August 22 1654, <a href=\"https://www.thecenterforruleoflaw.org/rule-of-law-blog/august-22-1654-jacob-barsimson-arrives-in-new-amsterdam-he-is-the-first-known-jewish-immigrant-to-america\">Jacob Barsimson arrived in New Amsterdam</a> after having left the Netherlands on July 8. Barsimson had been sent out by the Jewish leaders of Amsterdam, Dutch Republic to determine the possibilities of an extensive Jewish immigration to New Amsterdam. He is the first known Jewish immigrant to America. Jewish settlement in New Amsterdam began in <a href=\"https://www.historycentral.com/TheColonies/Jewarrive.html\">September 1654</a>. </p>\n<blockquote><p>In September 1654, 23 Jews arrived in New Amsterdam aboard the St Cathrien. The Jews had come from Recife in Northeast Brazil, where they lived under Dutch rule. The Portuguese captured Recife from the Dutch and expelled the Jews. When the Jews arrived the captain of the ship sued them for the money to pay for their passage. The local court sold their belonging and imprisoned two of the party.</p>\n<p>Peter Stuyvesant the governor of the colony was not happy to receive the Jews. He described the Jews as &#8220;deceitful&#8221; and very &#8220;repugnant&#8221;. Stuyvesant asked permission from the Dutch East India Company, who the colony belonged to remove the Jews from the settlement. The board, which included several Jewish investors, refused and instructed the governor to allow the new Jewish settlers to remain in New Amsterdam.</p>\n<p>The 23 Jews who arrived were not the first Jews to arrive in North America, but [this is] the first record we have of a group of men women and children arriving to make it their permanent home.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Source(s)</h3>\n<style type=\"text/css\">\r\n       .errordiv { padding:10px; margin:10px; border: 1px solid #555555;color: #000000;background-color: #f8f8f8; width:500px; }#advanced_iframe {visibility:visible;opacity:1;vertical-align:top;}.ai-info-bottom-iframe { position: fixed; z-index: 10000; bottom:0; left: 0; margin: 0px; text-align: center; width: 100%; background-color: #ff9999; padding-left: 5px;padding-bottom: 5px; border-top: 1px solid #aaa } a.ai-bold {font-weight: bold;}#ai-layer-div-advanced_iframe p {height:100%;margin:0;padding:0}#ai-div-container-advanced_iframe\r\n       { \r\n           position: relative;\r\n           width: 100%; max-width: 100%;}\r\n       #ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe\r\n       {\r\n          position: absolute;\r\n          z-index:1000;\r\n          margin-left:-33px;\r\n          left: 50%;   top: 150px;\r\n         }} \r\n       #ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe img\r\n       {\r\n          border: none;\r\n       }</style><script type=\"text/javascript\">var ai_iframe_width_advanced_iframe = 0;var ai_iframe_height_advanced_iframe = 0;var aiIsIe8=false;var aiOnloadScrollTop=\"true\";var aiShowDebug=false;\r\n\t\tif (typeof aiReadyCallbacks === 'undefined') {\r\n\t\t\tvar aiReadyCallbacks = [];  \r\n\t\t} else if (!(aiReadyCallbacks instanceof Array)) {\r\n\t\t\tvar aiReadyCallbacks = [];\r\n\t\t}    function aiShowIframeId(id_iframe) { jQuery(\"#\"+id_iframe).css(\"visibility\", \"visible\");    }    function aiResizeIframeHeight(height) { aiResizeIframeHeight(height,advanced_iframe); }    function aiResizeIframeHeightId(height,width,id) {aiResizeIframeHeightById(id,height);}</script><div id=\"ai-div-container-advanced_iframe\"><div id=\"ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-loader-icon\" src=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/plugins/advanced-iframe/img/loader.gif\" title=\"Loading\" alt=\"Loading\"></img></div><iframe id=\"advanced_iframe\"  name=\"advanced_iframe\"  src=\"https://archive.org/stream/250thanniversary00newyrich/250thanniversary00newyrich#page/4/mode/2up\"  width=\"100%\"  height=\"900\"  frameborder=\"0\"  allowtransparency=\"true\"  loading=\"lazy\"  style=\";width:100%;height:900px;;width:1px;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;\"  allowfullscreen  onload='jQuery(&quot;#ai-div-loader-advanced_iframe&quot;).hide();;jQuery(&quot;#ai-div-loader-global&quot;).hide()' ></iframe></div><script type=\"text/javascript\">var ifrm_advanced_iframe = document.getElementById(\"advanced_iframe\");var hiddenTabsDoneadvanced_iframe = false;\r\nfunction resizeCallbackadvanced_iframe() {}var recalculateIframeResizeadvanced_iframe = 0;\r\n        var recalculateIframeOrientationchangeadvanced_iframe = 0;\r\n        var aiWindowWidth = 0;\r\n\t\tfunction recalculateIframeadvanced_iframe() {\r\n          clearTimeout(recalculateIframeResizeadvanced_iframe);\r\n          clearTimeout(recalculateIframeOrientationchangeadvanced_iframe);}  \r\n        function initResponsiveIframeadvanced_iframe() {\r\n          jQuery(window).resize(function() {\r\n\t\t\t recalculateIframeResizeadvanced_iframe = window.setTimeout(\"recalculateIframeadvanced_iframe()\",100);\r\n          });\r\n          if (window.addEventListener) {\r\n            window.addEventListener(\"orientationchange\", function() {\r\n               recalculateIframeOrientationchangeadvanced_iframe = window.setTimeout(\"recalculateIframeadvanced_iframe()\",100);\r\n            }, false);\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n        aiReadyCallbacks.push(initResponsiveIframeadvanced_iframe);</script><style>#advanced_iframe {width: 1px !important;min-width:100% !important;max-width:100% !important;}</style><script type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
