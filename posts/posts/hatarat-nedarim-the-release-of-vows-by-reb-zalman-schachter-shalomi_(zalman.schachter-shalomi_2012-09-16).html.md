<blockquote>Almost everyone who is Jewish knows that Kol Nidre is about releasing vows and has participated in the ceremony. Few know the parallel ritual done in small groups before Rosh Hashanah. Traditionally, right before Rosh Hashanah one performs this simple ritual with three friends, each in turn becoming the petitioner, while the other three act as the beit din, the judges in a court. The ritual is a wonderful way to enter the holidays as well as to prepare oneself for what will happen on Yom Kippur.</blockquote>

In the last year I have from time to time made vows, 
sometimes speaking them out loud or had an intention, 
a resolution to change something in my actions, behavior and attitude in my mind. 
Some of these are in relation to myself, my body, my mind, and my soul. 
Some of these deal with the way in which I conduct myself in relation to other people. 
And most of all, there are those that deal with my relation to God.

Sometimes I took on a practice or a custom

and have since either willingly or unwillingly abandoned it

I ask you to release me from that, too.
