This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritans">Israelite-Samaritan</a> weekday prayerbook includes blessings for washing before prayer, the text of the Samaritans' two daily prayers (evening and morning), and their <em>nusaḥ</em> for counting the ʿOmer between the first Sunday of Pesaḥ and the holiday of Shavuʿot.

This file is all in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritan_alphabet">Samaritan script</a>, an offshoot of paleo-Hebrew which developed after the Jews had already switched to today's square "Ashurit" script.[foot]Israelite Samaritan's call "Ashurit" script, Aramaic Hebrew script[/foot] At the end of the prayerbook, I've added a short pronunciation guide for those familiar with English or modern Hebrew.

<strong>NEW</strong>: You can now download the prayerbook transliterated into <strong>modern Hebrew characters</strong> ("Ashurit"). The text is completely vowelled according to the Samaritan pronunciation. The prayerbook is available either as an editable <a href="https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/The-Israelite-Samaritan-Weekday-Prayerbook-Uri-DeYoung_Modern.odt">Open Document</a> file, or as a <a href="https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/The-Israelite-Samaritan-Weekday-Prayerbook-Uri-DeYoung_Modern.pdf">PDF</a> file.
