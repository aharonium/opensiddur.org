<sup>24:3</sup>&nbsp;When Jacob was cooking lentil porridge, Esau came hungry from the field. He said to his brother Jacob: 'Give me some of this wheat porridge'. But Jacob said to him: 'Hand over to me your birthright which belongs to the first-born, and then I will give you food and some of this porridge as well'. <sup>24:4</sup>&nbsp;Esau said to himself: 'I will die. What good will this right of the first-born do'? So he said to Jacob: 'I (hereby) give (it) to you'. <sup>24:5</sup>&nbsp;Jacob said to him: 'Swear to me today'. So he swore to him. <sup>24:6</sup>&nbsp;Then Jacob gave the food and porridge to his brother Esau, and he ate until he was full. Esau repudiated the right of the first-born. This is why he was named Esau and Edom: because of the wheat porridge which Jacob gave him in exchange for his right of the first-born. <sup>24:7</sup>&nbsp;So Jacob became the older one, but Esau was lowered from his prominent position.

<sup>30:11</sup>&nbsp;Now you, Moses, order the Israelites and testify to them that they are not to give any of their daughters to foreigners and that they are not to marry any foreign women because it is despicable before the Lord. <sup>30:12</sup>&nbsp;For this reason I have written for you in the words of the law everything that the Shechemites did to Dinah and how Jacob's sons said: 'We will not give our daughter to a man who has a foreskin because for us that would be a disgraceful thing'. <sup>30:13</sup>&nbsp;It is a disgraceful thing for the Israelites who give or take (in marriage) one of the foreign women because it is too impure and despicable for Israel. <sup>30:14</sup>&nbsp;Israel will not become clean from this impurity while it has one of the foreign women or if anyone has given one of his daughters to any foreign man. <sup>30:15</sup>&nbsp;For it is blow upon blow and curse upon curse. Every punishment, blow, and curse will come. If one does this or shuts his eyes to those who do impure things and who defile the Lord's sanctuary and to those who profane his holy name, then the entire nation will be condemned together because of all this impurity and this contamination. <sup>30:16</sup>&nbsp;There will be no favoritism nor partiality; there will be no receiving from him of fruit, sacrifices, offerings, fat, or the aroma of a pleasing fragrance so that he should accept it. (So) is any man or woman in Israel to be who defiles his sanctuary. <sup>30:17</sup>&nbsp;For this reason I have ordered you: 'Proclaim this testimony to Israel: «See how it turned out for the Shechemites and their children — how they were handed over to Jacob's two sons. They killed them in a painful way. It was a just act for them and was recorded as a just act for them». <sup>30:18</sup>&nbsp;Levi's descendants were chosen for the priesthood and as levites to serve before the Lord as we (do) for all time. Levi and his sons will be blessed forever because he was eager to carry out justice, punishment, and revenge on all who rise against Israel. <sup>30:19</sup>&nbsp;So blessing and justice before the God of all are entered for him as a testimony on the heavenly tablets. <sup>30:20</sup>&nbsp;We ourselves remember the justice which the man performed during his lifetime at all times of the year. As far as 1000 generations will they enter (it). It will come to him and his family after him. He has been recorded on the heavenly tablets as a friend and a just man'.

As for any man who uncovers the covering of his father — his act is indeed very bad and it is indeed despicable before the Lord. <sup>33:10</sup>&nbsp;For this reason it is written and ordained on the heavenly tablets that a man is not to lie with his father's wife and that he is not to uncover the covering of his father because it is impure. They are certainly to die together — the man who lies with his father's wife and the woman, too — because they have done something impure on the earth. <sup>33:11</sup>&nbsp;There is to be nothing impure before our God within the nation that he has chosen as his own possession. <sup>33:12</sup>&nbsp;Again it is written a second time: 'Let the one who lies with his father's wife be cursed because he has uncovered his father's shame'.

<sup>35:1</sup>&nbsp;During the first year of the first week in the forty-fifth jubilee [2157], Rebecca summoned her son Jacob and ordered him regarding his father and brother that he was to honor them throughout Jacob's entire lifetime. <sup>35:2</sup>&nbsp;Jacob said: 'I will do everything just as you ordered me because this matter will be something honorable and great for me; it will be a righteous act for me before the Lord that I should honor them. <sup>35:3</sup>&nbsp;You, mother, know everything I have done and all my thoughts from the day I was born until today — that at all times I think of what is good for all. <sup>35:4</sup>&nbsp;How shall I not do what you have ordered me — that I should honor my father and brother? <sup>35:5</sup>&nbsp;Tell me, mother, what impropriety you have noticed in me and I will certainly turn away from it and will experience mercy'. <sup>35:6</sup>&nbsp;She said to him: 'My son, throughout my entire lifetime I have noticed no improper act in you but only proper one(s). However, I will tell you the truth, my son: I will die during this year and will not make it alive through this year because I have seen the day of my death in a dream — that I will not live more than 155 years. Now I have completed my entire lifetime that I am to live'. <sup>35:7</sup>&nbsp;Jacob laughed at what his mother was saying because his mother said to him that she would die, but she was sitting in front of him in possession of her strength. She had lost none of her strength because she could come and go; she could see and her teeth were strong. No sickness had touched her throughout her entire lifetime. <sup>35:8</sup>&nbsp;Jacob said to her: 'Mother, I would be fortunate if my lifetime approached your lifetime and (if) my strength would remain with me in the way your strength has. You are not going to die but rather have jokingly spoken idle nonsense with me about your death'.

<sup>35:9</sup>&nbsp;She went in to Isaac and said to him: 'I am making one request of you: make Esau swear that he will not harm Jacob and not pursue him in hatred. For you know the way Esau thinks — that he has been malicious since his youth and that he is devoid of virtue because he wishes to kill him after your death. <sup>35:10</sup>&nbsp;You know everything that he has done from the day his brother Jacob went to Haran until today — that he has wholeheartedly abandoned us. He has treated us badly; he has gathered your flocks and has taken all your possessions away from you by force. <sup>35:11</sup>&nbsp;When we would ask him in a pleading way for what belonged to us, he would act like someone who was being charitable to us. <sup>35:12</sup>&nbsp;He is behaving bitterly toward you due to the fact that you blessed your perfect and true son Jacob since he has virtue only, no evil. From the time he came from Haran until today he has not deprived us of anything but he always brings us everything in its season. He is wholeheartedly happy when we accept (anything) from him, and he blesses us. He has not separated from us from the day he came from Haran until today. He has continually been living with us at home (all the while) honoring us'. <sup>35:13</sup>&nbsp;Isaac said to her. 'I, too, know and see the actions of Jacob who is with us — that he wholeheartedly honors us. At first I did love Esau more than Jacob, after he was born; but now I love Jacob more than Esau because he has done so many bad things and lacks (the ability to do) what is right. For the entire way he acts is (characterized by) injustice and violence and there is no justice about him. <sup>35:14</sup>&nbsp;Now my mind is disturbed about his actions. Neither he nor his descendants are to be saved because they will be destroyed from the earth and be uprooted from beneath the sky. For he has abandoned the God of Abraham and has gone after his wives, after impurity, and after their errors — he and his sons. <sup>35:15</sup>&nbsp;You are saying to me that I should make him swear not to kill his brother Jacob. Even if he does swear, it will not happen. He will not do what is virtuous but rather what is evil. <sup>35:16</sup>&nbsp;If he wishes to kill his brother Jacob, he will be handed over to Jacob and will not escape from his control but will fall into his control. <sup>35:17</sup>&nbsp;Now you are not to be afraid for Jacob because Jacob's guardian is greater and more powerful, glorious, and praiseworthy than Esau's guardian'.

<sup>36:1</sup>&nbsp;During the sixth year of this week [2162] Isaac summoned his two sons Esau and Jacob. When they had come to him, he said to them: 'My children, I am going on the way of my fathers, to the eternal home where my fathers are. <sup>36:2</sup>&nbsp;Bury me near my father Abraham in the double cave in the field of Ephron the Hittite which Abraham acquired to (have) a burial place there. There, in the grave that I dug for myself, bury me. <sup>36:3</sup>&nbsp;This is what I am ordering you, my sons: that you do what is right and just on the earth so that the Lord may bring on you everything which the Lord said that he would do for Abraham and his descendants. <sup>36:4</sup>&nbsp;Practice brotherly love among yourselves, my sons, like a man who loves himself, with each one aiming at doing what is good for his brother and at doing things together on the earth. May they love one another as themselves. <sup>36:5</sup>&nbsp;Regarding the matter of idols, I am instructing you to reject them, to be an enemy of them, and not to love them because they are full of errors for those who worship them and who bow to them. <sup>36:6</sup>&nbsp;My sons, remember the Lord, the God of your father Abraham (afterwards I, too, worshiped and served him properly and sincerely) so that he may make you numerous and increase your descendants in number like the stars of the sky and plant you in the earth as a righteous plant which will not be uprooted throughout all the history of eternity. <sup>36:7</sup>&nbsp;Now I will make you swear with the great oath — because there is no oath which is greater than it, by the praiseworthy, illustrious, and great, splendid, marvelous, powerful, and great name which made the heavens and the earth and everything together — that you will continue to fear and worship him, <sup>36:8</sup>&nbsp;as each loves his brother kindly and properly. One is not to desire what is bad for his brother now and forever, throughout your entire lifetime, so that you may be prosperous in everything that you do and not be destroyed. <sup>36:9</sup>&nbsp;If one of you aims at what is bad for his brother, be aware that from now on anyone who aims at what is bad for his brother will fall into his control and will be uprooted from the land of the living, while his descendants will be destroyed from beneath the sky. <sup>36:10</sup>&nbsp;On the day of turmoil and curse, of anger and wrath — with a blazing fire that devours — he will burn his land, his city, and everything that belongs to him just as he burned Sodom. He will be erased from the disciplinary book of mankind. He will not be entered in the book of life but in the one that will be destroyed. He will pass over to an eternal curse so that their punishment may always be renewed with denunciation and curse, with anger, pain, and wrath, and with blows and eternal sickness. <sup>36:11</sup>&nbsp;I am reporting and testifying to you, my sons, in accord with the punishment which will come on the man who wishes to do what is harmful to his brother'.

<sup>38:1</sup>&nbsp;After this Judah spoke to his father Jacob and said to him: 'Draw your bow, father; shoot your arrow; pierce the enemy; and kill the foe. May you have the strength because we will not kill your brother, since he is near to you and, in our estimation, he is equal to you in honor'. <sup>38:2</sup>&nbsp;Jacob then stretched his bow, shot an arrow, pierced his brother Esau [on his right breast], and struck him down. <sup>38:3</sup>&nbsp;He shot another arrow and hit Aduran the Aramean on his left breast; he drove him back and killed him. <sup>38:4</sup>&nbsp;After this Jacob's sons — they and their servants — went out, dividing themselves to the four sides of the tower. <sup>38:5</sup>&nbsp;Judah went out in front. Naphtali and Gad were with him, and 50 servants were with him on the south side of the tower. They killed everyone whom they found in front of them. No one at all escaped from them. <sup>38:6</sup>&nbsp;Levi, Dan, and Asher went out on the east side of the tower, and 50 were with them. They killed the Moabite and Ammonite warriors. <sup>38:7</sup>&nbsp;Reuben, Issachar, and Zebulun went out on the north side of the tower, and 50 were with them. They killed the Philistine fighting men. <sup>38:8</sup>&nbsp;Simeon, Benjamin, and Enoch — Reuben's son — went out on the west side of the tower, and 50 were with them. Of (the people of) Edom and the Horites they killed 400 strong warriors, and 600 ran away. Esau's four sons ran away with them. They left their slain father just as he had fallen on the hill that is in Aduram. <sup>38:9</sup>&nbsp;Jacob's sons pursued them as far as Mt. Seir, while Jacob buried his brother on the hill that is in Aduram and then returned to his house. <sup>38:10</sup>&nbsp;Jacob's sons pressed hard on Esau's sons in Mt. Seir. They bowed their necks to become servants for Jacob's sons. <sup>38:11</sup>&nbsp;They sent to their father (to ask) whether they should make peace with them or kill them. <sup>38:12</sup>&nbsp;Jacob sent word to his sons to make peace. So they made peace with them and placed the yoke of servitude on them so that they should pay tribute to Jacob and his sons for all time. <sup>38:13</sup>&nbsp;They continued paying tribute to Jacob until the day that Jacob went down to Egypt. <sup>38:14</sup>&nbsp;The Edomites have not extricated themselves from the yoke of servitude which Jacob's sons imposed on them until today.

<sup>41:1</sup>&nbsp;In the forty-fifth jubilee, the second week during the second year [2165], Judah took as a wife for his first-born Er one of the Aramean women whose name was Tamar. <sup>41:2</sup>&nbsp;He hated (her) and did not lie with her because his mother was a Canaanite woman and he wanted to marry someone from his mother's tribe. But his father Judah did not allow him. <sup>41:3</sup>&nbsp;That Er, Judah's first-born, was evil, and the Lord killed him. <sup>41:4</sup>&nbsp;Then Judah said to his brother Onan: 'Go in to your brother's wife, perform the levirate duty for her, and produce descendants for your brother'. <sup>41:5</sup>&nbsp;Onan knew that the descendants would not be his but his brother's, so he entered the house of his brother's wife and poured out the semen on the ground. In the Lord's estimation it was an evil act, and he killed him. <sup>41:6</sup>&nbsp;So Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar: 'Remain in your father's house as a widow until my son Selom grows up. Then I will give you to him as a wife'. <sup>41:7</sup>&nbsp;He grew up, but Judah's wife Bedsuel did not allow her son Selom to marry (her). Judah's wife Bedsuel died during the fifth year of this week [2168].

<sup>43:1</sup>&nbsp;He did as Joseph told him. He filled all their sacks with food for them and placed their money in their sacks. He put the cup in Benjamin's sack. <sup>43:2</sup>&nbsp;Early in the morning they went (off). But when they had left that place, Joseph said to the man of his house: 'Pursue them. Run and reprimand them as follows: «You have repaid me with evil instead of good. You have stolen from me the silver cup with which my master drinks». Bring their youngest brother back to me and bring him quickly, before I go out to the place where I rule'. <sup>43:3</sup>&nbsp;He ran after them and spoke to them in line with this message. <sup>43:4</sup>&nbsp;They said to him: 'Heaven forbid that your servants should do such a thing and should steal any container from the house of your master. Your servants have brought back from the land of Canaan the money that we found in our sacks the first time. <sup>43:5</sup>&nbsp;How, then, should we steal any container? Here we and our sacks are. Make a search, and anyone of us in whose sack you find the cup is to be killed, while we and our donkeys are to serve your master'. <sup>43:6</sup>&nbsp;He said to them: '(That) is not the way it will be. I will take only the man with whom I find it as a servant, and you may go safely to your home'. <sup>43:7</sup>&nbsp;As he was searching among their containers, he began with the oldest and ended with the youngest. It was found in Benjamin's sack. <sup>43:8</sup>&nbsp;They tore their clothing, loaded their donkeys, and returned to the city. When they arrived at Joseph's house, all of them bowed to him with their faces to the ground. <sup>43:9</sup>&nbsp;Joseph said to them: 'You have done an evil thing'. They said: 'What are we to say and what shall we say in our defense. Our master has discovered the crime of his servants. We ourselves and our donkeys, too, are our master's servants'. <sup>43:10</sup>&nbsp;Joseph said to them: 'As for me, I fear the Lord. As for you, go to your houses, but your brother is to be enslaved because you have done something evil. Do you not know that a man takes pleasure in his cup as I do in this cup? And you stole it from me'. <sup>43:11</sup>&nbsp;Then Judah said: 'Please, master, allow me, your servant, to say something in my master's hearing. His mother gave birth to two brothers for your servant our father. One has gone away and been lost; no one has found him. He alone is left of his mother('s children). And your servant our father loves him and his life is tied together with the life of this one. <sup>43:12</sup>&nbsp;If we go to your servant our father and if the young man is not with us, then he would die and we would bring our father down in sorrow to death. <sup>43:13</sup>&nbsp;Rather, I your servant will remain in place of the child as a servant of my master. Let the young man go with his brothers because I took responsibility for him from your servant our father. If I do not bring him back, your servant will be guilty to our father forever. <sup>43:14</sup>&nbsp;When Joseph saw that the minds of all of them were in harmony one with the other for good (ends), he was unable to control himself, and he told them that he was Joseph. <sup>43:15</sup>&nbsp;He spoke with them in the Hebrew language. He wrapped his arms around their necks and cried. But they did not recognize him and began to cry. <sup>43:16</sup>&nbsp;Then he said to them: 'Do not cry about me. Quickly bring my father to me and let me see him before I die, while my brother Benjamin also looks on. <sup>43:17</sup>&nbsp;For this is now the second year of the famine and there are still five more years without harvest, without fruit (growing on) trees, and without plowing. <sup>43:18</sup>&nbsp;You and your households come down quickly so that you may not die in the famine. Do not worry about your property because the Lord sent me first before you to arrange matters so that many people may remain alive. <sup>43:19</sup>&nbsp;Tell my father that I am still alive. You now see that the Lord has made me like a father to the pharaoh and to rule in his household and over the entire land of Egypt. <sup>43:20</sup>&nbsp;Tell my father about all my splendor and all the wealth and splendor which the Lord has given me'.

You killed him and hid him in the sand. <sup>47:11</sup>&nbsp;On the next day you found two of the Israelites fighting. You said to the one who was acting unjustly: 'Why are you beating your brother'? <sup>47:12</sup>&nbsp;He became angry and indignant and said: 'Who appointed you as ruler and judge over us? Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian'? Then you were afraid and ran away because of this matter.

You performed the signs and miracles which you were sent to perform in Egypt against the pharaoh, all his house, his servants, and his nation. <sup>48:5</sup>&nbsp;The Lord effected a great revenge against them on account of Israel. He struck them and killed them with blood, frogs, gnats, dog flies, bad sores which break out in blisters; (and he struck) their cattle with death; and with hailstones — with these he annihilated everything that was growing for them; with locusts which ate whatever was left for them from the hail; with darkness; (and with the death of) their first-born of men and cattle. The Lord took revenge on all their gods and burned them up. <sup>48:6</sup>&nbsp;Everything was sent through you, before it was done, so that you should do (it). You were speaking with the king of Egypt and in front of all his servants and his people. <sup>48:7</sup>&nbsp;Everything happened by your word.

He would help the Egyptian magicians and they would oppose (you) and perform in front of you. <sup>48:10</sup>&nbsp;We permitted them to do evil things, but we would not allow healings to be performed by them. <sup>48:11</sup>&nbsp;When the Lord struck them with bad sores, they were unable to oppose (you) because we deprived them of (their ability) to perform a single sign. <sup>48:12</sup>&nbsp;Despite all the signs and miracles, the prince of Mastema was not put to shame until he gained strength and cried out to the Egyptians to pursue you with all the Egyptian army — with their chariots, their horses — and with all the throng of the Egyptian people.

We are grateful to Dr. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160415140645/http://theology.nd.edu:80/people/faculty/james-c-vanderkam/">James VanderKam</a> for preparing this critical text of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Jubilees">Book of Jubilees</a> (<em>Sefer haYovelim</em>) in its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ge'ez_language">Ge'ez</a> translation in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ge'ez_script">Ethiopic script</a>. 

The book of Jubilees is an early Jewish deuterocanonical text composed in Hebrew during the Second Temple period sometime before the Maccabean struggle (ca. 167 BCE). In the introduction to his translation of Jubilees, Dr. VanderKam writes:

<blockquote>The present writer has argued at length that Jubilees was written between 161 and 152, while George Nickelsburg and Jonathan Goldstein have defended a date just before 167 B.C.[E.] on the grounds that the author betrays his knowledge of events that occurred in the first part of Antiochus IV's reign but is not aware of his religious edict which was promulgated in 167....[foot]NICKELSBURG, Jewish Literature Between the Bible and the Mishnah (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1981) 78-79; GOLDSTEIN, «The Date of the Book of Jubilees», PAAJR 50 (1983) 63-86. The apocalypse in Jubilees 23 plays a large part in these two attempts at dating.[/foot] 

Today students of the book agree that it was composed in Hebrew and that from Hebrew it was translated into Greek. It has been suggested...that a Hebrew text also served as the base for a Syriac translation, but it is not certain that there was a full Syriac translation and that, if there was one, it rendered a Hebrew rather than a Greek model. Copies of the Greek version of Jubilees then became the Vorlagen of translations into Latin and Ethiopic.

....The only version which preserves the complete text of Jubilees is the Ethiopic. The book was apparently translated from Greek at an early stage in the development of Ethiopic literature and enjoyed canonical status in the Abyssinian Church.</blockquote>

The English translation here was made by Dr. VanderKam and published in <em>The Book of Jubilees. A Translation</em> (Corpus Scriptorum Christianorum Orientalium 511 Scriptores Aethiopici 88) 1989.[foot]© 1989 by Corpus Scriptorum Christianorum Orientalium.[/foot] For the complete work including textual apparatus and annotation, please consult your local academic library.

Through the frame of a mytho-historical chronicle narrated by an angel, Jubilees (Sefer Yovalim) provides more than a gloss on most of Genesis through the giving of the Torah in Exodus. The unknown author presents a raison d'etre for the giving of the Torah itself in the context of world history, the human condition, and the existence of predation in Nature. It is one of the earliest pedagogical works (if not the earliest) explaining the purpose of Jewish teaching and practice to Jewish readers, in circumscribing the predatory passions that entered the world during the generation of the Flood. It is the earliest Jewish work providing a connection between the celebration of the festival of Shavuot (Pentecost) and the celebration of the giving of the Torah on Mt. Sinai. 

Finally, we are grateful to the Abyssinian Church and its generations of monks for preserving the book of Jubilees until this day.
