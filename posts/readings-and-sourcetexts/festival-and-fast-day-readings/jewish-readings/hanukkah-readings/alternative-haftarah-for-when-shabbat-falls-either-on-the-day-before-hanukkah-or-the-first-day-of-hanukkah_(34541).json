He is known for his prophecy in 520 BCE, commanding the Jews to rebuild the Temple. His name means \"my (pilgrimage) festivals.\" He was the first of three post-exile prophets from the Neo-Babylonian Exile of the House of Judah (with Zekhariah, his contemporary, and Malakhi, who lived about one hundred years later), who belonged to the period of Jewish history which began after the return from captivity in Babylon. Scarcely anything is known of his personal history. He may have been one of the captives taken to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar. He began prophecying about sixteen years after the return of the Jews to Judah (ca. 520 BCE). The work of rebuilding the Temple had been put to a stop after protestations by the Samaritan-Israelites. After having been suspended for eighteen years, the work was resumed through the efforts of Haggai and Zekhariah. They exhorted the people, which roused them from their lethargy, and induced them to take advantage of a change in the policy of the Persian government under Darius I.",
