(Megillat Yehudit should not be confused with the deutero-canonical Book of Judith authored in Antiquity). Megillat Yehudit tells a story of the heroic resistance of a young Jewish woman, Yehudit, (literally &#8220;Jewess&#8221;) amid the backdrop of the brutal oppression levied against Jerusalem and Judah by the Neo-Babylonian Empire in the 7th century BCE after the destruction of the first Temple. Possibly composed in the medieval period before or during the 11th century, its descriptions of sexual violence reflect the darkest anxieties of Jewish communities surviving in the shadow of Christendom&#8217;s crusades. Its use during Ḥanukkah, while a rarity today, is remembered alongside the reading of Megillat Antiokhus (circa 2nd-4th century CE), a retelling of the story of the Maccabees resistance to the Seleucid Greeks in the second century BCE. The crucial theme connecting the two stories for Ḥanukkah isn&#8217;t historical <em>per se</em>. Rather, both stories present a cultural memory recalling the heroism, martyrdom, and resistance within the Jewish community during their darkest times.</p>\n<p>The details of sexual violence in Megillat Yehudit, <a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/prayers-for/special-days/commemorative-days/hanukah/midrash-maaseh-hanukah/\">Midrash Ma&#8217;aseh Ḥanukkah</a>, and in at least one important variation of <a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/prayers-for/special-days/commemorative-days/hanukah/megillat-antiokhus/\">Megillat Antiokhus</a> are not intended to be sensational. Rather, they emphasize a tradition that holds human predatory activity in sex, diet, and other forms of vicious exploitation as depraved and taboo &#8212; a transgression of the Noaḥide law and covenant not to behave as a predator (<em>ever min haḥai</em>).<span class=\"footnote_referrer\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_1');\" onkeypress=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_1');\" ><sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_1\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\">[1]</sup></a><span id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_1\" class=\"footnote_tooltip\"> Genesis 9:4&nbsp;</span></span><script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery('#footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_1').tooltip({ tip: '#footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_1', tipClass: 'footnote_tooltip', effect: 'fade', predelay: 0, fadeInSpeed: 200, delay: 400, fadeOutSpeed: 200, position: 'center right', relative: true, offset: [0, 0], });</script>&nbsp; In particular, the work describes the villainous employ of the infamous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droit_du_seigneur\">Droit du Seigneur</a> (law of the thigh), a noble &#8220;right.&#8221; The 11th century commentator Rashi ascribed the origin of the Droit du Seigneur to the Nephilim and their Giant children in the story of the generation of the Flood, which the Torah presents as the very model of depraved behavior, an etiology of how predation entered Nature.<span class=\"footnote_referrer\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_2');\" onkeypress=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_2');\" ><sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_2\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\">[2]</sup></a><span id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_2\" class=\"footnote_tooltip\"> Genesis 6&nbsp;</span></span><script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery('#footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_2').tooltip({ tip: '#footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_2', tipClass: 'footnote_tooltip', effect: 'fade', predelay: 0, fadeInSpeed: 200, delay: 400, fadeOutSpeed: 200, position: 'center right', relative: true, offset: [0, 0], });</script>&nbsp; It is no accident that dairy is the traditional diet for Ḥanukkah.

(The soporific power of Torah is also attested in aggadot telling how the Israelites fell unconscious at the giving of the Torah at Sinai.) Dr. Deborah Levine Gera, <a href=\"http://books.openedition.org/obp/986\">provides additional context</a> from the period of the Rishonim when Megillat Yehudit was composed:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The foremost exegete of the Talmud, Rashi (Rabbi Solomon ben Isaac, 1041–1105), when discussing why women, as well as men, are required to light Hanukkah candles, simply notes that when the Greeks decreed that Jewish virgin brides were to be bedded first by the ruler, a woman brought about the miracle. We know that Rashi was acquainted with the liturgical poem <em><a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/prayers-for/special-days/commemorative-days/hanukah/odekha-ki-anafta-hymn-first-shabbat-of-hanukah-yosef-bar-shlomo-of-carcassone-circa-11th-c/\">Odekha ki anafta bi</a></em> because he quotes it elsewhere (in his commentary on Ez 21:18), so it is very likely that he knew of Judith’s deed, but did not choose to mention her by name. Rashi’s grandson, the Rashbam (Rabbi Samuel ben Meir 1085–1174), does mention Judith, and he is quoted as saying that the chief miracle of Purim came about through Esther, and that of Hanukkah through Judith.<span class=\"footnote_referrer\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_4');\" onkeypress=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_4');\" ><sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_4\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\">[4]</sup></a><span id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_4\" class=\"footnote_tooltip\"> Rashi on Babylonian Talmud Shabbat 23a; Tosafot on Babylonian Talmud Megillah 4a.&nbsp;</span></span><script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery('#footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_4').tooltip({ tip: '#footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_4', tipClass: 'footnote_tooltip', effect: 'fade', predelay: 0, fadeInSpeed: 200, delay: 400, fadeOutSpeed: 200, position: 'center right', relative: true, offset: [0, 0], });</script>&nbsp;  Later commentators bring further details. Nissim ben Reuben (ca. 1310–75), known as the Ran, refers to Judith not by name, but as the daughter of Yochanan. In his account, which he says comes from a midrash, the woman gave the chief enemy cheese to eat so as to make him drunk, and then cut off his head. This, adds the Ran, is why it is customary to eat cheese on Hanukkah.<span class=\"footnote_referrer\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_5');\" onkeypress=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_5');\" ><sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_5\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\">[5]</sup></a><span id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_5\" class=\"footnote_tooltip\"> Nissim ben Reuben on Alfasi, Shabbat 10a (on Babylonian Talmud Shabbat 23b).&nbsp;</span></span><script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery('#footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_5').tooltip({ tip: '#footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_5', tipClass: 'footnote_tooltip', effect: 'fade', predelay: 0, fadeInSpeed: 200, delay: 400, fadeOutSpeed: 200, position: 'center right', relative: true, offset: [0, 0], });</script>&nbsp; In the <em>Kol Bo</em> (section 44), a work outlining Jewish laws and customs dating to the thirteenth or fourteenth century, we find a similar version. In this account, the king of Greece attempts to seduce Judith, the daughter of the high priest Yochanan, and she feeds him a cheese dish so that he will become thirsty, drink too much, and fall asleep. Such references to Judith’s encounter with an enemy whom she fed either cheese or milk are subsequently found in a long line of works which codify halacha, Jewish law, and supply the background to the practice of eating cheese dishes on Hanukkah.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We have set our transcription side-by-side with the English translation made by Susan Weingarten, originally published as &#8220;Food, Sex, and Redemption in Megillat Yehudit: Appendix to Chapter 6,&#8221; in <em>Sword of Judith</em>. ed., Kevin R. Brine, Elena Ciletti, Henrike Lähnemann (Open Book Publishers, 2010) p.110-125. The secondary transcription sources we have used are the same as those used by Dr. Weingarten for her translation: A. Neubauer Catalogue no. 2746 = Heb. e. 10, fol. 66v–72v (Bodleian Library, Oxford) as transcribed by Abraham Meir Habermann in “Megillat yehudit le-omrah be-hanukkah,” מחנים 52 (1961), pp. 42–47, and by André-Marie Dubarle in <em>Judith: formes et sens des diverses traditions II: textes</em> (Rome, 1966), pp. 140–53. Although the copy from which our transcription derived was made in 1402, Dubarle notes that similarities to Menahem ben Machir&#8217;s Yotser (Hymn) for the Second Shabbat of Ḥanukkah (c. 11th century) suggest that it was composed then, or earlier. When we first published this piece we followed Dubarle&#8217;s date, but we&#8217;ve since been cautioned by Dr. Weingarten that the similarities in the yotsrot by Menachem ben Machir and Yosef ben Solomon of Carcassonne &#8220;only suggest the story of Judith in this version was current in the 11th century, but not that the text of Megillat Yehudit as we have it dates to the 11th century.&#8221;<span class=\"footnote_referrer\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_6');\" onkeypress=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_6');\" ><sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_6\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\">[6]</sup></a><span id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_6\" class=\"footnote_tooltip\"> Explained in private correspondence&nbsp;</span></span><script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery('#footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_6').tooltip({ tip: '#footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_6', tipClass: 'footnote_tooltip', effect: 'fade', predelay: 0, fadeInSpeed: 200, delay: 400, fadeOutSpeed: 200, position: 'center right', relative: true, offset: [0, 0], });</script>&nbsp; We have retained the section dividers that Dubarle used to compare the extant variations of Judith midrashim in our arrangement of paragraphs, and this has led to minor differences with the layout of Dr. Weingarten&#8217;s translation.</p>\n<p>Any errors in the transcription are my own. I am grateful to Dr. Weingarten for sharing her work under an Open Content license. Please read Dr. Weingarten&#8217;s complete chapter in <em>Sword of Judith</em> for additional context. Here is the introduction to her translation of Megillat Yehudit:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>Manuscript and editions</h3>\n<p>The single manuscript of Megillat Yehudit is at present in the Bodleian Library in Oxford: A. Neubauer Catalogue no. 2746 = Heb. e. 10, fol. 66v–72v. Neubauer’s catalogue notes that this document is bound together with Megillat Antiochus and other documents, one of which includes four sentences in Provençal. Below the title, Megillat Yehudit, is the instruction, written in smaller letters: “to be said on Hanukkah.” The manuscript is dated by its colophon to [5]162, i.e. 1402 c.e., and written in Hebrew in a fine regular hand, which Neubauer describes as “Provençal rabbinic.” Dubarle, who has edited many of the different versions of the story of Judith, calls it Megillath Judith de style anthologique (his no. 8).<span class=\"footnote_referrer\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_7');\" onkeypress=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_7');\" ><sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_7\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\">[7]</sup></a><span id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_7\" class=\"footnote_tooltip\"> André-Marie Dubarle, Judith: Formes et sens des diverses traditions, i: Études (Rome: Institut Biblique Pontifical, 1966), pp. 92–94. Biblical books are referenced with the short titles following the Chicago style (cf. index under “Bible”).&nbsp;</span></span><script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery('#footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_7').tooltip({ tip: '#footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_7', tipClass: 'footnote_tooltip', effect: 'fade', predelay: 0, fadeInSpeed: 200, delay: 400, fadeOutSpeed: 200, position: 'center right', relative: true, offset: [0, 0], });</script>&nbsp;  As he points out, 1402, when the manuscript was copied by Moses Shmeil Dascola, is not necessarily the date of redaction.</p>\n<p>The Hebrew text has been published twice in full by A.M. Habermann as “<em>Megillat yehudit le-omrah be-hanukkah</em>,” <em>Maḥanayim</em> 52 (1961), pp. 42–47 and in his <em>Ḥadashim gam yeshanim: hiburim shonim mi-tokh kitvei yad be-tziruf mevo’ot ve-he’arot</em> (Jerusalem, 1975), pp. 40–46. The second part of the manuscript only, with the story of Judith, was published by A.M. Dubarle: <em>Judith: formes et sens des diverses traditions II: textes</em> (Rome, 1966), pp. 140–53, with a French translation. There is a microfiche of the whole manuscript in the National Library in Jerusalem.</p>\n<h3>Translator’s note</h3>\n<p>It is interesting that the act of translating attracts metaphors of the female body. My male Greek teacher used to say of translations that they are like women: if they are beautiful they are unlikely to be faithful, and if they are faithful they are unlikely to be beautiful. I fear this translation is neither: it is certainly not scientific. My excuse is that this is a preliminary translation, aimed at giving readers who are not familiar with the original Hebrew some idea of Megillat Yehudit. As the writer Shai Agnon said, reading a Hebrew work in translation is like kissing a bride through her veil. Hebrew words carry with them a biblical load, all the more so when the work is written, as here, almost entirely as a string of biblical quotations and allusions. I have noted over three hundred scriptural citations, shown in italics, and I am sure there are more. It would be interesting to analyze them all and their intertextual effect. I have made a start on the group of references to women and food in my paper above.</p>\n<p>I have used all three published texts of Megillat Yehudit as well as the microfiche for this translation. For the biblical quotations I have made use of three translations of the Hebrew Bible: the Revised Standard Version; the New English Bible and the Jewish Publication Society’s Tanakh. None of them is wholly satisfactory in the new context of Megillat Yehudit. Note that changes of person and number of the verb, and other grammatical infelicities are typical of this document. Many of these are due to the use of quotations, which the author does not always adapt to the new context. I am grateful to Deborah Gera for her critical reading of this translation and her helpful suggestions.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Vocalization and Cantillation</h3>\n<p>Niqqud (vowels) and t&#8217;amim (cantillation, trope) have been added by Isaac Gantwerk Mayer based upon the underlying text sourced from the Tanakh.

Habermann thought there was clearly a lacuna in the text, which begins again with Holophernes’s speech. However, he read he-atem ami “Are you not my people?,” perhaps thinking the previous verse referred to a speech by Judith because of the mention of yehudit. Dubarle reads ha-mitem ami “Have you not killed my people?,” which is a slightly adapted quotation from Numbers 17:6 [RV 16:41]. This has the advantage of making the whole speech belong to Holophernes, without any lacuna.</td></tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"footnotes_plugin_reference_row\"> <th scope=\"row\"
