According to the Supplementary hypothesis presented by Dr. Tzemaḥ Yoreh, 'P' supplements the earlier 'J' narrative with dates, names, and numbers, \"thus 'ordering' and authenticating 'J's account.\" This strata dates from the exilic and early post-exilic period, 571–486 BCE.  'P' is the Pentateuchal (and, to a lesser extent, the Prophetical) source most concerned with the priests, the temple, the regulation of sacrifices (e.g. what to bring on which day), and organization in general, including censuses, the division of labor among the various clans of Levites, and the hierarchy among the tribes. 'P' is responsible for the first of the two creation stories in Genesis (a/k/a Genesis 1), for the genealogies of Adam and Shem, the covenants with Noaḥ and Avraham, and a few other stories concerning Avraham, Yitsḥak and Yaakov. Aside from these, the bulk of 'P's texts are found at the end of Exodus (specifically Exodus 25–40), throughout Leviticus, in Numbers 1–10, and in Joshua 13–21. An important feature of 'P' is their copious addition of lists to the text. Many of these lists are genealogies (e.g. Gen. 5, 11, 36), but they can also be lists of stations on Israel’s journey throughout the wilderness (e.g. Num. 33), cities (e.g. Josh. 14–21), and censuses (e.g. Num. 1–3). By inundating the reader with lists, 'P' attempts to enhance the authority of the Bible, ensuring that their version of events is accepted over possible alternatives. 'P' was a hands-off redactor, preferring to make their additions at the beginnings and ends of narratives. Note that their creation list and genealogical lists appear entirely before and after the earlier account of creation and expulsion from Eden, respectively. Both additions alter our understanding of the surrounded material in important ways without being invasive. Only when the matter at hand is of grave importance to 'P,' as in the case of the pillaging of the innocent inhabitants of Shechem, does 'P' delve fully into the text.",

By combining the book of E, the Book of the Covenant (a law code found in Exodus 21–24), and the northern book of Judges (predecessor to the canonical book of Judges), and supplementing them with J's own text, J composed a cohesive historical work which chronicles the events from the creation of the world to the crowning of King David in nine story cycles, focusing on the Israelite line. J’s editorial style is highly invasive. In adding their own voice to that of their predecessor E, J often overwhelms the reader with their point of view to the extent that E’s original narrative threads are no longer apparent.",

    "content": "<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\"style=\"font-size:1.2em\">\nAccording to the poetry of the Midrash Tanchuma, Bereshit 1:1, the words of the Torah were inscribed &#8220;black fire on white fire.&#8221; For many years, I&#8217;ve wanted to look deeply into the black fire and visualize the full spectrum of the Torah&#8217;s sources, hidden within the black fire but revealed through  a critical analysis of its layers of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redaction_criticism\">redaction</a>. Below, I&#8217;ve set the text of the first Torah portion in the annual Torah reading cycle, using color-coding to distinguish the stratigraphic layers forming the composition of the Masoretic text according to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplementary_hypothesis\">Supplementary Hypothesis</a> presented by Tsemaḥ Yoreh in his <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=tpLIngEACAAJ\">Kernel to Canon</a> series of books (2013-2017). As Dr. Yoreh explains, </p>\n<blockquote><p>The Supplementary Hypothesis asserts that the Pentateuch was composed by several different writers. This reflects an overwhelming academic consensus on Biblical authorship, even among scholars who do not subscribe to the Supplementary Hypothesis in particular.[&#8230;.] According to the Supplementary Hypothesis, Biblical narrative is layered. No editor took a blowtorch to the parts of the Bible he disagreed with and destroyed them; if he had, we would not find these repetitions and contradictions. Instead, Biblical narrative began with a coherent, foundational bedrock, which over time accreted more and more storylines. Unlike geological processes, though, this process of addition was deliberate. What happened if one author disagreed with his predecessor’s storyline or worldview? He did not simply take an axe to the narrative; instead, he attempted to bury his predecessor’s point of view by repeating his own over and over again, thus skewing our understanding of the story in new ways. Every generation of readers sees the world differently, and thus every generation of writers seeks to adapt their predecessors’ cultural heritage to their own situation. We are not meant simply to dismiss earlier stories; rather, the intention of later writers is to transform our understanding of those stories via their additions.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"j\">&#11035; The earliest of the three strata in Parashat Bereshit was composed in the late eighth or early seventh century BCE in the southern Kingdom of Judah.

The formula occurs exclusively in P texts, and thus if it is to be attributed to P here it would seem to indicate that P knew of J&#8217;s narrative in Chapter 2. The other option is that of a third author combining the two narratives (Chapters 1 and 2), but that seems a lot less likely considering the prevalence of the formula in Priestly texts.

The root to know (ידע) also plays an important role in this chapter (vs. 9) and in Chapters 3 and 4, it means to know sexually, as well as to distinguish; sexual knowledge using the verb ידע is common in J.

The reader expects some sort of retribution, and prima facie, it seems that Cain is indeed punished: Yhwh pronounces that &#8220;the earth will not give you of her strength&#8221; (4:11) and that Cain shall be forced to wander in order to scratch out his sustenance. If the punishment is examined more closely however, one finds that it is in fact only an echo of the harshly worded curse God pronounces upon Adam. The mild language used in the description of Cain&#8217;s sentence is in marked contrast with the graphic description of Cain culpability: &#8220;The blood of your brother screams to me from the earth.&#8221; (4:10) Furthermore, it would seem that Cain&#8217;s punishment of exile is never really carried out, he is described as &#8220;settling&#8221; in the land of Nod (4:16) – an obvious wordplay on the content of the punishment (na&#8217; vanad) thus making subtle mockery of it &#8211; and he builds the first city (4:17), both marked signs of sedentary lifestyle. Even if Cain was exiled it is clear that in the Pentateuchal law codes the punishment does not fit the crime. Exile is enumerated as a possible punishment for murder in the Pentateuchal law codes, but only in cases when the murder is accidental. ¶This, however, is not the most mystifying element of the account.  Yhwh&#8217;s promise to protect Cain from retribution, by providing him with the proverbial: &#8220;Cain&#8217;s mark&#8221;, which would ensure a sevenfold revenge, borders on the extraordinary. The fact that people would wish to kill Cain is only natural and entirely just according to the law codes of the time, Cain did kill his brother in cold blood after all. No protection is provided to a person who kills his or her fellow in cold blood according to Deuteronomy. In fact, it is the closest living relative&#8217;s responsibility to kill the murderer. Lemech, Cain&#8217;s descendant, brags that if Cain were to be revenged sevenfold for his death, than he, Lemech, who also is guilty of murder should be revenged seventy seven fold in case of his (Lemech’s) untimely demise. Lemech&#8217;s pronouncement can be understood as a mockery of Yhwh&#8217;s promise to Cain to keep from harm. How can a murderer expect retribution in the case of his death? His death, according to all conventional legal systems is entirely justified. Abel&#8217;s blood then continues to scream across the generations, and who shall answer it? Who shall punish the first murderer? ¶The answer that J provides is the flood. Cain&#8217;s fratricide marks the antedelluvian (pre-flood) generation as evil and sets the stage for the cataclysmic flood which follows immediately.

Seth, Adam third son (vs. 6) and the genealogy through him, was in my opinion a priestly construct inserted after the birth of Lemech children, in order to prevent the first murderer Cain from being rewarded with the honor of being humanity&#8217;s founding father. ¶ J&#8217;s list of Cain&#8217;s sons in chapter 4 end with a Yahistic &#8220;Lemech&#8221; (4:18).  The Priestly genealogy through Seth ends with a Priestly &#8220;Lemech&#8221; giving birth to Noah (5:28-29). The etymology of Noah&#8217;s name is, however, not Priestly, it is Yahwistic (&#8220;the earth, cursed by Yhwh&#8221;). Note that the rest of chapter 5 (vss. 1, 24) uses the name &#8220;Elohim&#8221; (God) whereas this verse uses the name Yhwh. It would seem then that according to the Yahwist after the birth of Lemech (the first&#8217;s) other children, he finally produced a son over whom he was able to pronounce, &#8220;Here is the one who will comfort us…&#8221; (5:29). P incorporated Lemech into his genealogy (which is in fact a reworking of the J genealogy and note that P simply &#8220;borrowed&#8221; the names from J&#8217;s genealogy of chapter 4: Cain vs. Keinan; Hanokh vs. Hanokh; Irad vs. Yered; Mehuyael vs Mahallel; Metushael vs. Methuselah) and thus Noah&#8217;s birth notice is cut off from its original Yahwistic context and Cain from his place in biblical &#8220;history&#8221;.

Why would we talk of the lifespan of human beings when they are about to be completely destroyed? Moreover, this limited lifespan does not accord with the Noah&#8217;s lifespan of 600 years in the subsequent chapter, nor with the lifespan of his children in Chapter 11. The fallen angel myth is contrary to the very monotheistic tenor of the Genesis narratives in both J and P and the decided lack of an angel hierarchy and demigod figures in these sources.&nbsp;</span></span><script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery('#footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_22').tooltip({ tip: '#footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_22', tipClass: 'footnote_tooltip', effect: 'fade', predelay: 0, fadeInSpeed: 200, delay: 400, fadeOutSpeed: 200, position: 'center right', relative: true, offset: [0, 0], });</script>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<mark>מפטיר</mark> <span class=\"j\"><sup>ה</sup>&nbsp;וַיַּ֣רְא יְהֹוָ֔ה כִּ֥י רַבָּ֛ה רָעַ֥ת הָאָדָ֖ם בָּאָ֑רֶץ וְכׇל־יֵ֙צֶר֙ מַחְשְׁבֹ֣ת לִבּ֔וֹ רַ֥ק רַ֖ע כׇּל־הַיּֽוֹם׃ <sup>ו</sup>&nbsp;וַיִּנָּ֣חֶם יְהֹוָ֔ה כִּֽי־עָשָׂ֥ה אֶת־הָֽאָדָ֖ם בָּאָ֑רֶץ וַיִּתְעַצֵּ֖ב אֶל־לִבּֽוֹ׃ <sup>ז</sup>&nbsp;וַיֹּ֣אמֶר יְהֹוָ֗ה אֶמְחֶ֨ה אֶת־הָאָדָ֤ם אֲשֶׁר־בָּרָ֙אתִי֙ מֵעַל֙ פְּנֵ֣י הָֽאֲדָמָ֔ה מֵֽאָדָם֙ עַד־בְּהֵמָ֔ה עַד־רֶ֖מֶשׂ וְעַד־ע֣וֹף הַשָּׁמָ֑יִם כִּ֥י נִחַ֖מְתִּי כִּ֥י עֲשִׂיתִֽם׃ <sup>ח</sup>&nbsp;וְנֹ֕חַ מָ֥צָא חֵ֖ן בְּעֵינֵ֥י יְהֹוָֽה׃</span><br />\n</span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\n<span class=\"j\"><sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Now YHVH saw that great was the Earthling&#8217;s evildoing on earth and every form of their heart&#8217;s planning was only evil all the day. <sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Then YHVH was sorry that he had made the Earthling on earth, and it pained his heart. <sup>7</sup>&nbsp;YHVH said: &#8220;I will blot out the Earthling, whom I have created, from the face of the fertile-ground, from human to herd-animal, to crawling thing and to the birds of the sky, for I am sorry that I made them.&#8221; <sup>8</sup>&nbsp;But Noaḥ found favor in the eyes of YHVH.</span><span class=\"footnote_referrer\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_23');\" onkeypress=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_23');\" ><sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_23\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\">[23]</sup></a><span id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_23\" class=\"footnote_tooltip\"> The J section ends in vs. 8 with a statement of Noah finding favor in Yhwh&#8217;s eyes, Noah is previously mentioned in J&#8217;s birth notice appropriated into the P genealogy of Chapter 5.

The position adopted in this commentary will be the former; I think that the process of narrative composition in the Pentateuch and former prophets was almost exclusively supplementary.

Taking into account the other ten occurrences of this formula in which it always functions as an introduction, it seems a lot likelier that אלה תולדות is an opening statement. The formula occurs exclusively in P texts, and thus if it is to be attributed to P here it would seem to indicate that P knew of J&#8217;s narrative in Chapter 2. The other option is that of a third author combining the two narratives (Chapters 1 and 2), but that seems a lot less likely considering the prevalence of the formula in Priestly texts. Note also the appearance of the root ברא following this formula, which appears in P&#8217;s Chapter 1 as opposed to the roots יצר and עשה which appear in Chapter 2. ¶The grammatical structure of vs. 4b ביום עשות ה&#8217; אלהים ארץ ושמים &#8220;(&#8220;In the day that the Lord God made earth and Heavens&#8221;) is parallel to the grammatical structure of Gen 1:1, בראשית ברא אלהים את השמים ואת הארץ (often mistranslated as &#8220;in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth&#8221;, no the is apparent in the vocalized Hebrew) – both are  temporal clauses dependent upon the subsequent verses, thus both may be paraphrased as &#8220;When God created heaven and earth, the earth was….&#8221;</td></tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"footnotes_plugin_reference_row\"> <th scope=\"row\" id=\"footnote_plugin_reference__1_8\" class=\"footnote_plugin_index pointer\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor__1('footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_8');\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"footnote_plugin_link\" >8</a></th> <td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">The distinction between ברא (to create ) in Chapter 1 and יצר (to create) in Chapter 2 was noted in Chapter 1.

The root to know (ידע) also plays an important role in this chapter (vs. 9) and in Chapters 3 and 4, it means to know sexually, as well as to distinguish; sexual knowledge using the verb ידע is common in J.

Note also that in Chapter 1 (P) the material from which God created human beings and animals is not mentioned, whereas in Chapter 2 (J) it is dust or earth.

The trees that threaten Yhwh domination are within the garden, yet as opposed to the rest of the trees there is no indication that He planted them – in other words they are beyond his power.

The reader expects some sort of retribution, and prima facie, it seems that Cain is indeed punished: Yhwh pronounces that &#8220;the earth will not give you of her strength&#8221; (4:11) and that Cain shall be forced to wander in order to scratch out his sustenance. If the punishment is examined more closely however, one finds that it is in fact only an echo of the harshly worded curse God pronounces upon Adam. The mild language used in the description of Cain&#8217;s sentence is in marked contrast with the graphic description of Cain culpability: &#8220;The blood of your brother screams to me from the earth.&#8221; (4:10) Furthermore, it would seem that Cain&#8217;s punishment of exile is never really carried out, he is described as &#8220;settling&#8221; in the land of Nod (4:16) – an obvious wordplay on the content of the punishment (na&#8217; vanad) thus making subtle mockery of it &#8211; and he builds the first city (4:17), both marked signs of sedentary lifestyle. Even if Cain was exiled it is clear that in the Pentateuchal law codes the punishment does not fit the crime. Exile is enumerated as a possible punishment for murder in the Pentateuchal law codes, but only in cases when the murder is accidental. ¶This, however, is not the most mystifying element of the account.  Yhwh&#8217;s promise to protect Cain from retribution, by providing him with the proverbial: &#8220;Cain&#8217;s mark&#8221;, which would ensure a sevenfold revenge, borders on the extraordinary. The fact that people would wish to kill Cain is only natural and entirely just according to the law codes of the time, Cain did kill his brother in cold blood after all. No protection is provided to a person who kills his or her fellow in cold blood according to Deuteronomy. In fact, it is the closest living relative&#8217;s responsibility to kill the murderer. Lemech, Cain&#8217;s descendant, brags that if Cain were to be revenged sevenfold for his death, than he, Lemech, who also is guilty of murder should be revenged seventy seven fold in case of his (Lemech’s) untimely demise. Lemech&#8217;s pronouncement can be understood as a mockery of Yhwh&#8217;s promise to Cain to keep from harm. How can a murderer expect retribution in the case of his death? His death, according to all conventional legal systems is entirely justified. Abel&#8217;s blood then continues to scream across the generations, and who shall answer it? Who shall punish the first murderer? ¶The answer that J provides is the flood. Cain&#8217;s fratricide marks the antedelluvian (pre-flood) generation as evil and sets the stage for the cataclysmic flood which follows immediately. The answer P provides is evident in Chapter 5, and see the commentary there.</td></tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"footnotes_plugin_reference_row\"> <th scope=\"row\" id=\"footnote_plugin_reference__1_19\" class=\"footnote_plugin_index pointer\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor__1('footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_19');\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"footnote_plugin_link\" >19</a></th> <td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">Note the use of the qal passive form yulad (was born) in vs. 26, which appears in the post priestly (Bridger) genealogies of Chapter 10, as well as in Gen 22:20-22, and in many other places, P uses the hiphil (vayoled – he fathered, as throughout Genesis 11, or the niphal (hivaled – was born) form, as in Genesis 21:5, of the verb ילד (to give birth).</td></tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"footnotes_plugin_reference_row\"> <th scope=\"row\" id=\"footnote_plugin_reference__1_20\" class=\"footnote_plugin_index pointer\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor__1('footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_20');\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"footnote_plugin_link\" >20</a></th> <td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">As noted in the general comments (see comment below v.31) the birth notice of Noah differs markedly from the rest of the genealogical list.

Seth, Adam third son (vs. 6) and the genealogy through him, was in my opinion a priestly construct inserted after the birth of Lemech children, in order to prevent the first murderer Cain from being rewarded with the honor of being humanity&#8217;s founding father. ¶ J&#8217;s list of Cain&#8217;s sons in chapter 4 end with a Yahistic &#8220;Lemech&#8221; (4:18).  The Priestly genealogy through Seth ends with a Priestly &#8220;Lemech&#8221; giving birth to Noah (5:28-29). The etymology of Noah&#8217;s name is, however, not Priestly, it is Yahwistic (&#8220;the earth, cursed by Yhwh&#8221;). Note that the rest of chapter 5 (vss. 1, 24) uses the name &#8220;Elohim&#8221; (God) whereas this verse uses the name Yhwh. It would seem then that according to the Yahwist after the birth of Lemech (the first&#8217;s) other children, he finally produced a son over whom he was able to pronounce, &#8220;Here is the one who will comfort us…&#8221; (5:29). P incorporated Lemech into his genealogy (which is in fact a reworking of the J genealogy and note that P simply &#8220;borrowed&#8221; the names from J&#8217;s genealogy of chapter 4: Cain vs. Keinan; Hanokh vs. Hanokh; Irad vs. Yered; Mehuyael vs Mahallel; Metushael vs. Methuselah) and thus Noah&#8217;s birth notice is cut off from its original Yahwistic context and Cain from his place in biblical &#8220;history&#8221;. In the J version provided on this website we place this birth notice of chapter 5 as part of the continuous J narrative.</td></tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"footnotes_plugin_reference_row\"> <th scope=\"row\" id=\"footnote_plugin_reference__1_22\" class=\"footnote_plugin_index pointer\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor__1('footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_22');\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"footnote_plugin_link\" >22</a></th> <td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">6:1-4 adds the myth of the fallen angels to the tamer account of the fall of humanity. The addition of racy mythic elements to the book of Genesis is attributed in this commentary to the Bridging source, a post priestly redactor, who bridges between tradition cycles and adds his own mythic flavour to the narratives.<br />\nThis section is clearly removed from the rest of the chapter. Why would we talk of the lifespan of human beings when they are about to be completely destroyed? Moreover, this limited lifespan does not accord with the Noah&#8217;s lifespan of 600 years in the subsequent chapter, nor with the lifespan of his children in Chapter 11. The fallen angel myth is contrary to the very monotheistic tenor of the Genesis narratives in both J and P and the decided lack of an angel hierarchy and demigod figures in these sources.</td></tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"footnotes_plugin_reference_row\"> <th scope=\"row\" id=\"footnote_plugin_reference__1_23\" class=\"footnote_plugin_index pointer\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor__1('footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_23');\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"footnote_plugin_link\" >23</a></th> <td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">The J section ends in vs. 8 with a statement of Noah finding favor in Yhwh&#8217;s eyes, Noah is previously mentioned in J&#8217;s birth notice appropriated into the P genealogy of Chapter 5. Vs. 9 launches into Noah&#8217;s genealogy beginning with אלה תולדות – &#8220;these are the generations&#8221; formula, repeating the final verses of chapter 5, a fitting segue to vs. 8. The fracture between J and P is, however, quite apparent. Noah is righteous in vs. 9, while J explicitly mentions that all of humanity is evil (vss.  5-7), even Noah, who perhaps finds favor in Yhwh&#8217;s eyes  is not exempt from this moral pronouncement. Noah&#8217;s drunkenness in Chapter 9 certainly doesn&#8217;t reflect well on him. The deity&#8217;s name switches abruptly from &#8220;the Lord&#8221; vs. 8 to &#8220;God&#8221; in vs. 9. The following verses 9-22 command Noah to build the ark, and provide him with very ordered and detailed instructions, as opposed to the sketchy details in the J version at the beginning of Chapter 7. This is reminiscent of the ordered and detailed Priestly creation account as opposed to the story-like account of J&#8217;s creation narrative.</td></tr>\r\n\r\n </tbody> </table> </div></div><script type=\"text/javascript\"> function footnote_expand_reference_container__1() { jQuery('#footnote_references_container__1').show(); jQuery('#footnote_reference_container_collapse_button__1').text('−'); } function footnote_collapse_reference_container__1() { jQuery('#footnote_references_container__1').hide(); jQuery('#footnote_reference_container_collapse_button__1').text('+'); } function footnote_expand_collapse_reference_container__1() { if (jQuery('#footnote_references_container__1').is(':hidden')) { footnote_expand_reference_container__1(); } else { footnote_collapse_reference_container__1(); } } function footnote_moveToReference__1(p_str_TargetID) { footnote_expand_reference_container__1(); var l_obj_Target = jQuery('#' + p_str_TargetID); if (l_obj_Target.length) { jQuery( 'html, body' ).delay( 0 ); jQuery('html, body').animate({ scrollTop: l_obj_Target.offset().top - window.innerHeight * 0.2 }, 380); } } function footnote_moveToAnchor__1(p_str_TargetID) { footnote_expand_reference_container__1(); var l_obj_Target = jQuery('#' + p_str_TargetID); if (l_obj_Target.length) { jQuery( 'html, body' ).delay( 0 ); jQuery('html, body').animate({ scrollTop: l_obj_Target.offset().top - window.innerHeight * 0.2 }, 380); } }</script>",
