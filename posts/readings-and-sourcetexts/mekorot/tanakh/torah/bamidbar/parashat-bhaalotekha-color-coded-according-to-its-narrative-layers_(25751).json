By combining the book of E, the Book of the Covenant (a law code found in Exodus 21–24), and the northern book of Judges (predecessor to the canonical book of Judges), and supplementing them with J's own text, J composed a cohesive historical work which chronicles the events from the creation of the world to the crowning of King David in nine story cycles, focusing on the Israelite line. J’s editorial style is highly invasive. In adding their own voice to that of their predecessor E, J often overwhelms the reader with their point of view to the extent that E’s original narrative threads are no longer apparent.",

According to the Supplementary hypothesis presented by Dr. Tzemaḥ Yoreh, 'P' supplements the earlier 'J' narrative with dates, names, and numbers, \"thus 'ordering' and authenticating 'J's account.\" This strata dates from the exilic and early post-exilic period, 571–486 BCE.  'P' is the Pentateuchal (and, to a lesser extent, the Prophetical) source most concerned with the priests, the temple, the regulation of sacrifices (e.g. what to bring on which day), and organization in general, including censuses, the division of labor among the various clans of Levites, and the hierarchy among the tribes. 'P' is responsible for the first of the two creation stories in Genesis (a/k/a Genesis 1), for the genealogies of Adam and Shem, the covenants with Noaḥ and Avraham, and a few other stories concerning Avraham, Yitsḥak and Yaakov. Aside from these, the bulk of 'P's texts are found at the end of Exodus (specifically Exodus 25–40), throughout Leviticus, in Numbers 1–10, and in Joshua 13–21. An important feature of 'P' is their copious addition of lists to the text. Many of these lists are genealogies (e.g. Gen. 5, 11, 36), but they can also be lists of stations on Israel’s journey throughout the wilderness (e.g. Num. 33), cities (e.g. Josh. 14–21), and censuses (e.g. Num. 1–3). By inundating the reader with lists, 'P' attempts to enhance the authority of the Bible, ensuring that their version of events is accepted over possible alternatives. 'P' was a hands-off redactor, preferring to make their additions at the beginnings and ends of narratives. Note that their creation list and genealogical lists appear entirely before and after the earlier account of creation and expulsion from Eden, respectively. Both additions alter our understanding of the surrounded material in important ways without being invasive. Only when the matter at hand is of grave importance to 'P,' as in the case of the pillaging of the innocent inhabitants of Shechem, does 'P' delve fully into the text.",

This 'H' layer popularized Kohanite law for the masses after the Temple was destroyed, and functioned as an intermediary between Kohanite lists and laws and the surrounding narrative.

    "content": "<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\"style=\"font-size:1.2em\">\nAccording to the poetry of the Midrash Tanḥuma, Bereshit 1:1, the words of the Torah were inscribed &#8220;black fire on white fire.&#8221; For many years, I&#8217;ve wanted to look deeply into the black fire and visualize the full spectrum of the Torah&#8217;s sources, hidden within the black fire but revealed through  a critical analysis of its layers of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redaction_criticism\">redaction</a>. Below, I&#8217;ve set the text of the Torah portion in the annual Torah reading cycle, using color-coding to distinguish the stratigraphic layers forming the composition of the Masoretic text according to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplementary_hypothesis\">Supplementary Hypothesis</a> presented by Tsemaḥ Yoreh in his <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=tpLIngEACAAJ\">Kernel to Canon</a> series of books (2013-2017) and his website, <a href=\"http://www.biblecriticism.com/supplementary_index.html\">the Sources of Biblical Narrative</a>. As Dr. Yoreh explains, </p>\n<blockquote><p>The Supplementary Hypothesis asserts that the Pentateuch was composed by several different writers. This reflects an overwhelming academic consensus on Biblical authorship, even among scholars who do not subscribe to the Supplementary Hypothesis in particular.[&#8230;.] According to the Supplementary Hypothesis, Biblical narrative is layered. No editor took a blowtorch to the parts of the Bible he disagreed with and destroyed them; if he had, we would not find these repetitions and contradictions. Instead, Biblical narrative began with a coherent, foundational bedrock, which over time accreted more and more storylines. Unlike geological processes, though, this process of addition was deliberate. What happened if one author disagreed with his predecessor’s storyline or worldview? He did not simply take an axe to the narrative; instead, he attempted to bury his predecessor’s point of view by repeating his own over and over again, thus skewing our understanding of the story in new ways. Every generation of readers sees the world differently, and thus every generation of writers seeks to adapt their predecessors’ cultural heritage to their own situation. We are not meant simply to dismiss earlier stories; rather, the intention of later writers is to transform our understanding of those stories via their additions.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Legend</h3>\n<p><span class=\"e\">&#11035; The kernel of biblical text upon which all other narratives were laid is thought to have been composed in the mid- to late eighth century BCE toward the end of the heyday of the northern Kingdom of Ephraim (one of the two kingdoms that occupied Biblical Israel). This layer, commonly referred to as &#8216;E&#8217;, is indicated with INDIGO text. The first parashah containing text of this layer was <a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/liturgical-readings/torah-readings/annual-cycle/sefer-bereshit/parashat-vayera/parashat-vayera-color-coded-according-to-its-narrative-layers/\">parashat Vayera</a> in Sefer Bereshit.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"j\">&#11035; The next oldest layer is thought to have been composed in the late 8th or early 7th century BCE in the southern Kingdom of Judah.

This is the first time the Israelites travel since arriving at Sinai. The chapter employs information from Numbers 1-2 which detailed the names of the tribal leaders, the exact numbers of tribesmen, as well as information regarding the order of travel &#8211; one more case of P&#8217;s remarkable command-compliance paradigm.

Indeed, these verses, describe the ark, as a mythic salvation object, representing the deity, and are thus, quite unrelated to the previous verses which discussed Israel&#8217;s desert travels. This type of mythic addition to Pentateuchal texts is the mark of the late Bridger.</td></tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"footnotes_plugin_reference_row\"> <th scope=\"row\" id=\"footnote_plugin_reference__1_6\" class=\"footnote_plugin_index pointer\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor__1('footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_6');\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"footnote_plugin_link\" >6</a></th> <td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\"> This episode revisits the Yahwistic complaint pattern. The people complain, the Lord punishes them, they call out to Moses, Moses calls out to the Lord, the Lord ceases his punishment. It is the shortest example of such an episode and is barely more than formulaic. It is likely that it was composed solely to function as the other half of a symmetric pair, within the encompassing symmetry of the Moses cycle. Its &#8220;other half&#8221; is the war against Amalek in Exodus 17:8-16 – and note the formula, &#8220;in the ears of&#8221; [translated less literally by NRSV as &#8220;in the hearing of&#8221;] which appears in both episodes  (Numbers 11:1, and Exodus 17:14 &#8211; its somewhat extraneous here) and the idea of the Lord eating away at the outlying areas of the camp, which is how the war with Amalek is described in Deut 25:17-19.</td></tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"footnotes_plugin_reference_row\"> <th scope=\"row\" id=\"footnote_plugin_reference__1_7\" class=\"footnote_plugin_index pointer\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor__1('footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_7');\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"footnote_plugin_link\" >7</a></th> <td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">Since the Manna is a priestly innovation, the allusion to it in a non-priestly text must be post-priestly, in other words, this episode was likely added by the later Bridger. This episode elaborates upon the short description of the Quail in Exodus 16 (P and H), and crafts it into yet another Israelite complaint against their desert sojourn. </td></tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"footnotes_plugin_reference_row\"> <th scope=\"row\" id=\"footnote_plugin_reference__1_8\" class=\"footnote_plugin_index pointer\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor__1('footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_8');\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"footnote_plugin_link\" >8</a></th> <td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">B&#8217;s complaint episode was added to J&#8217;s account of the appointment of 70 elders (the description of the manna, followed by the Lord&#8217;s command to appoint elders is a definite non-sequitor), which parallels the Elohistic appointment of judges and leaders in Exodus 18. In Exodus 18, Jethro advised Moses to appoint elders, while in Numbers 11, the Lord commands it, this is reflective of J&#8217; theo-centric narrative as opposed to E&#8217;s anthropocentricism. Note that B takes up J&#8217;s theme of Moses being unable to care for the people alone (&#8220;<sup>11</sup> So Moses said to the Lord, ‘Why have you treated your servant so badly? Why have I not found favour in your sight, that you lay the burden of all this people on me?&#8221;), thus creating a bridge to J&#8217;s very different episode.</td></tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"footnotes_plugin_reference_row\"> <th scope=\"row\" id=\"footnote_plugin_reference__1_9\" class=\"footnote_plugin_index pointer\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor__1('footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_9');\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"footnote_plugin_link\" >9</a></th> <td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">Instead of inserting another introductory formula &#8220;And the Lord said to Moses…&#8221; in vs. 18, B smoothly inserts the divine speech following, the Lord&#8217;s command to Moses to gather the 70 elders.</td></tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"footnotes_plugin_reference_row\"> <th scope=\"row\" id=\"footnote_plugin_reference__1_10\" class=\"footnote_plugin_index pointer\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor__1('footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_10');\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"footnote_plugin_link\" >10</a></th> <td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">Note the allusion to 600,000 men as the number of the Israelites (vs. 21) which otherwise only appears in P and H (e.g. Numbers 1:46).</td></tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"footnotes_plugin_reference_row\"> <th scope=\"row\" id=\"footnote_plugin_reference__1_11\" class=\"footnote_plugin_index pointer\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor__1('footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_11');\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"footnote_plugin_link\" >11</a></th> <td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">The seventy elders are appointed, and are granted the Lord&#8217;s spirit which causes them to prophesy ecstatically.
