            "bio": "The textual source called 'E' is the earliest of all literary sources in the Torah, the kernel from which all other narratives expanded upon. E was composed in the mid- to late eighth century BCE, toward the end of the heyday of the northern Ephraimite Kingdom, one of the two kingdoms that occupied Biblical Israel. The Kingdom of Ephraim was the larger and more urban of the two, and had its capital in Samaria, the city after which the Samaritans are named. To its south lay the smaller, but better-known Kingdom of Judah, whose capital city was Jerusalem. It seems likely that E was composed during this period because it marked the first literary flowering in ancient Israel. We know this based on the books of Amos and Hosea, composed at about that time, and from a wealth of inscriptions that we can confidently date to that period. The book of E, so called because it uses Elohim as its exclusive name for the deity of the Pentateuch, is composed of five story cycles focusing on five early Israelite heroes: Avraham, Yaakov, Yosef, Moshe, and Bilaam. The stories of Avraham and Bilaam are placed at the beginning and end of the Elohistic document, respectively, so that the two men can serve as models for how one should fear the remote and awesome God of the Elohistic source. The Yaakov, Yosef, and Moshe cycles, which comprise the bulk of the E narrative, chronicle Israel’s metamorphisis from a family into a people.",

By combining the book of E, the Book of the Covenant (a law code found in Exodus 21–24), and the northern book of Judges (predecessor to the canonical book of Judges), and supplementing them with J's own text, J composed a cohesive historical work which chronicles the events from the creation of the world to the crowning of King David in nine story cycles, focusing on the Israelite line. J’s editorial style is highly invasive. In adding their own voice to that of their predecessor E, J often overwhelms the reader with their point of view to the extent that E’s original narrative threads are no longer apparent.",

According to the Supplementary hypothesis presented by Dr. Tzemaḥ Yoreh, 'P' supplements the earlier 'J' narrative with dates, names, and numbers, \"thus 'ordering' and authenticating 'J's account.\" This strata dates from the exilic and early post-exilic period, 571–486 BCE.  'P' is the Pentateuchal (and, to a lesser extent, the Prophetical) source most concerned with the priests, the temple, the regulation of sacrifices (e.g. what to bring on which day), and organization in general, including censuses, the division of labor among the various clans of Levites, and the hierarchy among the tribes. 'P' is responsible for the first of the two creation stories in Genesis (a/k/a Genesis 1), for the genealogies of Adam and Shem, the covenants with Noaḥ and Avraham, and a few other stories concerning Avraham, Yitsḥak and Yaakov. Aside from these, the bulk of 'P's texts are found at the end of Exodus (specifically Exodus 25–40), throughout Leviticus, in Numbers 1–10, and in Joshua 13–21. An important feature of 'P' is their copious addition of lists to the text. Many of these lists are genealogies (e.g. Gen. 5, 11, 36), but they can also be lists of stations on Israel’s journey throughout the wilderness (e.g. Num. 33), cities (e.g. Josh. 14–21), and censuses (e.g. Num. 1–3). By inundating the reader with lists, 'P' attempts to enhance the authority of the Bible, ensuring that their version of events is accepted over possible alternatives. 'P' was a hands-off redactor, preferring to make their additions at the beginnings and ends of narratives. Note that their creation list and genealogical lists appear entirely before and after the earlier account of creation and expulsion from Eden, respectively. Both additions alter our understanding of the surrounded material in important ways without being invasive. Only when the matter at hand is of grave importance to 'P,' as in the case of the pillaging of the innocent inhabitants of Shechem, does 'P' delve fully into the text.",

    "content": "<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\"style=\"font-size:1.2em\">\nAccording to the poetry of the Midrash Tanchuma, Bereshit 1:1, the words of the Torah were inscribed &#8220;black fire on white fire.&#8221; For many years, I&#8217;ve wanted to look deeply into the black fire and visualize the full spectrum of the Torah&#8217;s sources, hidden within the black fire but revealed through  a critical analysis of its layers of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redaction_criticism\">redaction</a>. Below, I&#8217;ve set the text of the first Torah portion in the annual Torah reading cycle, using color-coding to distinguish the stratigraphic layers forming the composition of the Masoretic text according to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplementary_hypothesis\">Supplementary Hypothesis</a> presented by Tsemaḥ Yoreh in his <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=tpLIngEACAAJ\">Kernel to Canon</a> series of books (2013-2017). As Dr. Yoreh explains, </p>\n<blockquote><p>The Supplementary Hypothesis asserts that the Pentateuch was composed by several different writers. This reflects an overwhelming academic consensus on Biblical authorship, even among scholars who do not subscribe to the Supplementary Hypothesis in particular.[&#8230;.] According to the Supplementary Hypothesis, Biblical narrative is layered. No editor took a blowtorch to the parts of the Bible he disagreed with and destroyed them; if he had, we would not find these repetitions and contradictions. Instead, Biblical narrative began with a coherent, foundational bedrock, which over time accreted more and more storylines. Unlike geological processes, though, this process of addition was deliberate. What happened if one author disagreed with his predecessor’s storyline or worldview? He did not simply take an axe to the narrative; instead, he attempted to bury his predecessor’s point of view by repeating his own over and over again, thus skewing our understanding of the story in new ways. Every generation of readers sees the world differently, and thus every generation of writers seeks to adapt their predecessors’ cultural heritage to their own situation. We are not meant simply to dismiss earlier stories; rather, the intention of later writers is to transform our understanding of those stories via their additions.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"e\">&#11035; The kernel of biblical text upon which all other narratives were laid is thought to have been composed in the mid- to late eighth century BCE toward the end of the heyday of the northern Kingdom of Ephraim (one of the two kingdoms that occupied Biblical Israel).

Note that אמה is attested to as arm or appendage in Psalms 91:4 (after the vocalization is emended) and elsewhere as was correctly noted by Zeligman.&nbsp;</span></span><script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery('#footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_10').tooltip({ tip: '#footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_10', tipClass: 'footnote_tooltip', effect: 'fade', predelay: 0, fadeInSpeed: 200, delay: 400, fadeOutSpeed: 200, position: 'center right', relative: true, offset: [0, 0], });</script>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<span class=\"p\"><sup>כג</sup>&nbsp;וַיְהִי֩ בַיָּמִ֨ים הָֽרַבִּ֜ים הָהֵ֗ם וַיָּ֙מׇת֙ מֶ֣לֶךְ מִצְרַ֔יִם וַיֵּאָנְח֧וּ בְנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֛ל מִן־הָעֲבֹדָ֖ה וַיִּזְעָ֑קוּ וַתַּ֧עַל שַׁוְעָתָ֛ם אֶל־הָאֱלֹהִ֖ים מִן־הָעֲבֹדָֽה׃ <sup>כד</sup>&nbsp;וַיִּשְׁמַ֥ע אֱלֹהִ֖ים אֶת־נַאֲקָתָ֑ם וַיִּזְכֹּ֤ר אֱלֹהִים֙ אֶת־בְּרִית֔וֹ אֶת־אַבְרָהָ֖ם אֶת־יִצְחָ֥ק וְאֶֽת־יַעֲקֹֽב׃ <sup>כה</sup>&nbsp;וַיַּ֥רְא אֱלֹהִ֖ים אֶת־בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל וַיֵּ֖דַע אֱלֹהִֽים׃</span><br />\n</span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\n<span class=\"p\"><sup>23</sup>&nbsp;It was, many years later, the king of Mitsrayim died.

It is unlikely that it was verbal since it would not have aided him in proving God&#8217;s existence and commitment to the Israelites. The structure of vs. 12 seems to indicate that God&#8217;s sign to Moses is the subsequent worship on the Mountain of God, this is difficult since it does not validate Moses&#8217; leadership until after the fact. If, however, this sign is read in the context of the E narrative it makes a lot of sense since worship at Mount Sinai is the first manifestation of God in this source after Exodus 3, and occurs at the relative beginning of Moses&#8217; tenure as leader which ends in E after the conquest of the land in Numbers 21 (in J and P Moses is only a desert leader). The sign thus validates Moses&#8217; continued leadership in God&#8217;s first Elohistic manifestation after Exodus 3.<br />\n<br />According to some documentary scholars it is at this point in the narrative where E switches to &#8220;the Lord&#8221;. There is, however, little textual evidence to support this claim since vs. 15 (15 God also said to Moses, “Thus you shall say to the Israelites, ‘The LORD, the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you’: This is my name forever, and this my title for all generations.) is clearly an addition to the text (note the word &#8220;also&#8221;). God has already been named: &#8220;I am who I am&#8221;  in vs. 14, and vs. 15 clearly contradicts this statement. Moreover, vs. 15, mentions the Patriarchal triad which did not exist according to E (Isaac was killed in Genesis 22). Vs. 15 is a verse in the Yahwistic vein which seeks to reveal God special name &#8220;Yahweh&#8221; to the world through the Exodus.&nbsp;</span></span><script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery('#footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_24').tooltip({ tip: '#footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_24', tipClass: 'footnote_tooltip', effect: 'fade', predelay: 0, fadeInSpeed: 200, delay: 400, fadeOutSpeed: 200, position: 'center right', relative: true, offset: [0, 0], });</script>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"liturgy\" lang=\"heb-Hebr\">\n<span class=\"j\"><sup>טו</sup>&nbsp;וַיֹּ֩אמֶר֩ ע֨וֹד אֱלֹהִ֜ים אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֗ה כֹּֽה־תֹאמַר֮ אֶל־בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵל֒ יְהֹוָ֞ה אֱלֹהֵ֣י אֲבֹתֵיכֶ֗ם אֱלֹהֵ֨י אַבְרָהָ֜ם אֱלֹהֵ֥י יִצְחָ֛ק וֵאלֹהֵ֥י יַעֲקֹ֖ב שְׁלָחַ֣נִי אֲלֵיכֶ֑ם זֶה־שְּׁמִ֣י לְעֹלָ֔ם וְזֶ֥ה זִכְרִ֖י לְדֹ֥ר דֹּֽר׃ <mark>חמישי</mark> <sup>טז</sup>&nbsp;לֵ֣ךְ וְאָֽסַפְתָּ֞ אֶת־זִקְנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֗ל וְאָמַרְתָּ֤ אֲלֵהֶם֙ יְהֹוָ֞ה אֱלֹהֵ֤י אֲבֹֽתֵיכֶם֙ נִרְאָ֣ה אֵלַ֔י אֱלֹהֵ֧י אַבְרָהָ֛ם יִצְחָ֥ק וְיַעֲקֹ֖ב לֵאמֹ֑ר פָּקֹ֤ד פָּקַ֙דְתִּי֙ אֶתְכֶ֔ם וְאֶת־הֶעָשׂ֥וּי לָכֶ֖ם בְּמִצְרָֽיִם׃ <sup>יז</sup>&nbsp;וָאֹמַ֗ר אַעֲלֶ֣ה אֶתְכֶם֮ מֵעֳנִ֣י מִצְרַ֒יִם֒ אֶל־אֶ֤רֶץ הַֽכְּנַעֲנִי֙ וְהַ֣חִתִּ֔י וְהָֽאֱמֹרִי֙ וְהַפְּרִזִּ֔י וְהַחִוִּ֖י וְהַיְבוּסִ֑י אֶל־אֶ֛רֶץ זָבַ֥ת חָלָ֖ב וּדְבָֽשׁ׃</span><br />\n</span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\n<span class=\"j\"><sup>15</sup>&nbsp;And Elohim said further to Mosheh: &#8220;Thus shall you say to the Children of Yisrael: &#8216;YHVH, the <em>elo&#8217;ah</em> of your fathers, the <em>elo&#8217;ah</em> of Avraham, the <em>elo&#8217;ah</em> of Yitsḥaq, and the <em>elo&#8217;ah</em> of Yaaqov, sends me to you.

Some commentators suggest that Shifra and Puah were only the representatives or leaders of the midwives. Another option is that this narrative is folkloric and the details need not accord with other non-folkloric traditions. The simplest solution in my mind is that in the E narrative, the number of Israelites is nowhere near as prolific as in P, and that the source assumes a number closer to 6000.

It is unlikely that it was verbal since it would not have aided him in proving God&#8217;s existence and commitment to the Israelites. The structure of vs. 12 seems to indicate that God&#8217;s sign to Moses is the subsequent worship on the Mountain of God, this is difficult since it does not validate Moses&#8217; leadership until after the fact. If, however, this sign is read in the context of the E narrative it makes a lot of sense since worship at Mount Sinai is the first manifestation of God in this source after Exodus 3, and occurs at the relative beginning of Moses&#8217; tenure as leader which ends in E after the conquest of the land in Numbers 21 (in J and P Moses is only a desert leader). The sign thus validates Moses&#8217; continued leadership in God&#8217;s first Elohistic manifestation after Exodus 3.</p>\n<p>According to some documentary scholars it is at this point in the narrative where E switches to &#8220;the Lord&#8221;. There is, however, little textual evidence to support this claim since vs. 15 (15 God also said to Moses, “Thus you shall say to the Israelites, ‘The LORD, the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you’: This is my name forever, and this my title for all generations.) is clearly an addition to the text (note the word &#8220;also&#8221;). God has already been named: &#8220;I am who I am&#8221;  in vs. 14, and vs. 15 clearly contradicts this statement. Moreover, vs. 15, mentions the Patriarchal triad which did not exist according to E (Isaac was killed in Genesis 22). Vs. 15 is a verse in the Yahwistic vein which seeks to reveal God special name &#8220;Yahweh&#8221; to the world through the Exodus.</td></tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"footnotes_plugin_reference_row\"> <th scope=\"row\" id=\"footnote_plugin_reference__1_25\" class=\"footnote_plugin_index pointer\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor__1('footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_25');\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"footnote_plugin_link\" >25</a></th> <td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">Note the nature of Moses&#8217; leadership – he is to act as the Lord&#8217;s mouthpiece (and see vss. 7-8).</td></tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"footnotes_plugin_reference_row\"> <th scope=\"row\" id=\"footnote_plugin_reference__1_26\" class=\"footnote_plugin_index pointer\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor__1('footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_26');\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"footnote_plugin_link\" >26</a></th> <td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">The antecedent of &#8220;they&#8221; in vs. 18, is the Israelites (vs. 14) rather than the elders of vs. 17. ¶ Note that according to E, the King of Egypt will not let them go, even if compelled to do so by a mighty hand – and indeed according to E, the Israelites escape Egypt after the plagues.
