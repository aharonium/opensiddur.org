            "bio": "'P,' also known as the \"Priestly\" source, is one of the primary sources of the Masoretic text of the Torah in the Hebrew Bible. According to the Supplementary hypothesis presented by Dr. Tzemaḥ Yoreh, 'P' supplements the earlier 'J' narrative with dates, names, and numbers, \"thus 'ordering' and authenticating 'J's account.\" This strata dates from the exilic and early post-exilic period, 571–486 BCE.  'P' is the Pentateuchal (and, to a lesser extent, the Prophetical) source most concerned with the priests, the temple, the regulation of sacrifices (e.g. what to bring on which day), and organization in general, including censuses, the division of labor among the various clans of Levites, and the hierarchy among the tribes. 'P' is responsible for the first of the two creation stories in Genesis (a/k/a Genesis 1), for the genealogies of Adam and Shem, the covenants with Noaḥ and Avraham, and a few other stories concerning Avraham, Yitsḥak and Yaakov. Aside from these, the bulk of 'P's texts are found at the end of Exodus (specifically Exodus 25–40), throughout Leviticus, in Numbers 1–10, and in Joshua 13–21. An important feature of 'P' is their copious addition of lists to the text. Many of these lists are genealogies (e.g. Gen. 5, 11, 36), but they can also be lists of stations on Israel’s journey throughout the wilderness (e.g. Num. 33), cities (e.g. Josh. 14–21), and censuses (e.g. Num. 1–3). By inundating the reader with lists, 'P' attempts to enhance the authority of the Bible, ensuring that their version of events is accepted over possible alternatives. 'P' was a hands-off redactor, preferring to make their additions at the beginnings and ends of narratives. Note that their creation list and genealogical lists appear entirely before and after the earlier account of creation and expulsion from Eden, respectively. Both additions alter our understanding of the surrounded material in important ways without being invasive. Only when the matter at hand is of grave importance to 'P,' as in the case of the pillaging of the innocent inhabitants of Shechem, does 'P' delve fully into the text.",

This 'H' layer popularized Kohanite law for the masses after the Temple was destroyed, and functioned as an intermediary between Kohanite lists and laws and the surrounding narrative. 'H' mainly features in Exodus-Joshua, and is confined in the Book of Genesis to just a few verses in Parashat Toldot.",

    "content": "<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\"style=\"font-size:1.2em\">\nAccording to the poetry of the Midrash Tanḥuma, Bereshit 1:1, the words of the Torah were inscribed &#8220;black fire on white fire.&#8221; For many years, I&#8217;ve wanted to look deeply into the black fire and visualize the full spectrum of the Torah&#8217;s sources, hidden within the black fire but revealed through  a critical analysis of its layers of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redaction_criticism\">redaction</a>. Below, I&#8217;ve set the text of the Torah portion in the annual Torah reading cycle, using color-coding to distinguish the stratigraphic layers forming the composition of the Masoretic text according to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplementary_hypothesis\">Supplementary Hypothesis</a> presented by Tsemaḥ Yoreh in his <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=tpLIngEACAAJ\">Kernel to Canon</a> series of books (2013-2017) and his website, <a href=\"http://www.biblecriticism.com/supplementary_index.html\">the Sources of Biblical Narrative</a>. As Dr. Yoreh explains, </p>\n<blockquote><p>The Supplementary Hypothesis asserts that the Pentateuch was composed by several different writers. This reflects an overwhelming academic consensus on Biblical authorship, even among scholars who do not subscribe to the Supplementary Hypothesis in particular.[&#8230;.] According to the Supplementary Hypothesis, Biblical narrative is layered. No editor took a blowtorch to the parts of the Bible he disagreed with and destroyed them; if he had, we would not find these repetitions and contradictions. Instead, Biblical narrative began with a coherent, foundational bedrock, which over time accreted more and more storylines. Unlike geological processes, though, this process of addition was deliberate. What happened if one author disagreed with his predecessor’s storyline or worldview? He did not simply take an axe to the narrative; instead, he attempted to bury his predecessor’s point of view by repeating his own over and over again, thus skewing our understanding of the story in new ways. Every generation of readers sees the world differently, and thus every generation of writers seeks to adapt their predecessors’ cultural heritage to their own situation. We are not meant simply to dismiss earlier stories; rather, the intention of later writers is to transform our understanding of those stories via their additions.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Legend</h3>\n<p><span class=\"e\">&#11035; The kernel of biblical text upon which all other narratives were laid is thought to have been composed in the mid- to late eighth century BCE toward the end of the heyday of the northern Kingdom of Ephraim (one of the two kingdoms that occupied Biblical Israel). This layer, commonly referred to as &#8216;E&#8217;, is indicated with INDIGO text. The first parashah containing text of this layer was <a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/liturgical-readings/torah-readings/annual-cycle/sefer-bereshit/parashat-vayera/parashat-vayera-color-coded-according-to-its-narrative-layers/\">parashat Vayera</a> in Sefer Bereshit.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"j\">&#11035; The next oldest layer is thought to have been composed in the late 8th or early 7th century BCE in the southern Kingdom of Judah. This layer, commonly known as &#8216;J&#8217;, is indicated with a BLUE text.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"p\">&#11035; This strata, thought to have been composed during the exilic to early post-exilic period (571–486 BCE) is, as Dr. Yoreh explains, &#8220;responsible for supplementing the &#8216;J&#8217; narrative with dates, names, and numbers, thus &#8216;ordering&#8217; and authenticating &#8216;J&#8217;s account.&#8221; This layer, commonly referred to as &#8216;P&#8217; (for &#8216;Priestly&#8217;) appears here in GREEN text.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"h\">&#11035; The next strata popularized Kohanite law for the remnant of Judah after the Temple was destroyed, and functioned as an intermediary between Kohanite lists and laws and the surrounding narrative. This layer, which Dr. Yoreh calls &#8216;H&#8217; (for the &#8216;Holiness Code&#8217;) appears here in LIME-GREEN text.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"b\">&#11035; The most recent layer of text, is a post-exilic (pre-3rd century BCE) text that Dr. Yoreh refers to as the &#8220;Bridger&#8221; which supplements earlier strata with genealogies and popular myths, providing narrative bridges between distant story cycles. This &#8216;B&#8217; layer is presented here in FUCHSIA.</span></p>\n<p>The kernel of biblical text &#8216;E,&#8217; its early supplemental layer &#8216;J&#8217;, and its later supplement &#8216;B,&#8217; are absent from this parashah.</p>\n<p>Parashat Vayaqhel <span class=\"citation\">(Exodus 35:1-38:20)</span> in the annual Torah reading cycle, is read either on the fourth shabbat of the month of Adar א during a Jewish leap year or the fourth shabbat of Adar during a regular non-leap year.

For the translation in English, I have adapted the translation of Everett Fox in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1?ven=The_Five_Books_of_Moses,_by_Everett_Fox._New_York,_Schocken_Books,_1995&#038;lang=bi&#038;aliyot=0\">Schocken Bible</a> (Everett Fox 1995), mostly to re-Hebraize divine names, place names, and personal names. As with the last parashot (Terumah, T&#8217;tsavveh, and Ki Tissa), I have been careful to Hebraize the Mishkan and its main sacred objects. For &#8216;taḥashim,&#8217; I follow the recommendation of of Assyriologst Stephanie Dalley, <a href=\"https://thetorah.com/what-was-the-tachash-covering-the-tabernacle/\">who recommends &#8216;faience beaded-leather skins&#8217;</a>. (Fox has &#8220;tanned-leather skins.&#8221;) Aside from these, I have made minor punctuation changes.
