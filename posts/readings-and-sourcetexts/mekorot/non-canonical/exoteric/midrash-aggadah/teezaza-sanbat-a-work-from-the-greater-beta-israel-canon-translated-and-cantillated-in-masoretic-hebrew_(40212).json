The term Falasha, meaning &#8220;landless&#8221; or &#8220;wanderers,&#8221; was commonly used by the Christians of Ethiopia to refer to the Betä Ǝsraʾel, and at the time it was the standard term for the community used in scholarship. Due to its derogatory origin, the Betä Ǝsraʾel community considers it an ethnic slur.

The Commandments of the Sabbath well deserves its first place in this collection, for it is one of the most attractive of [Beta Israel] literary productions.</p>\n<p>To Jews everywhere and at all times the Sabbath has been particularly valued. But it was left for the [Beta Israel] to give it a metaphysical background by viewing the day as a female figure personifying the heavenly world. This is analogous to what Hellenistic Jewish and subsequent Gnostic speculation has done with such a concept as wisdom. But to personify the Sabbath day in similar manner was a new departure. However, the personification is not carried through consistently in this text but occurs only intermittently.</p>\n<p>[1.] The document begins with a formula of praise of the God of Israel taken from Num. 16:22. It then relates the story of the six days of creation. The creation of man is elaborated on in an interesting way. Dust has to be brought from the country of Dudālēm for the purpose. The archangels Gērmā&#8217;ēl and &#8216;Aksā&#8217;ēl, who are dispatched in turn to fetch it, are overawed by the earth&#8217;s invoking God&#8217;s glorious name in self-defense and return empty handed. Běrnā&#8217;ēl, however, who has no regard for that invocation, brings the dust, but in doing so he rouses the Deity&#8217;s ire and is thrown down to earth by Michael. At God&#8217;s command he is changed into fire. He asks that those who transgress God&#8217;s commandments be given into his power so that they may be punished along with him.</p>\n<p>[2.] God now creates Adam. Between the account of fashioning the inanimate body and that of infusing the breath of life into it there seems to be some misplaced material about God&#8217;s ceasing work on the seventh day and creating Hell on the third day. The newly formed Adam is put in the &#8220;Garden of Pleasure&#8221; to guard it for forty-one days. He transgresses the commandments of the Creator (though no prohibition has been stated) and is claimed by Běrnā&#8217;ēl. By invoking the name of God he manages to have this fate put off. We then hear that man has transgressed night and day on the Sabbath. Once more Bernā&#8217;ēl claims him and receives consent to man&#8217;s being punished with him in Hell. The angels, however, advise Adam to go into God&#8217;s presence and ask God to give him the holy Sabbath. He stays there for forty-one days).</p>\n<p>[3.] Without further explanation of this issue we hear of the Lord&#8217;s creating woman out of a rib; the story of the fall is related essentially as in Gen. 2-3. Here, however, the garden is called &#8216;Elyās and man after being driven out of it dwells east of Edom.</p>\n<p>[4.] At this point the author introduces an interlude in which the archangels praise God and ask Him for food. The earth implores Him for rain, God finally sends it, and all the birds and animals praise the Creator.</p>\n<p>[5.] The story of humanity continues. This is a separate piece, however, for the name of the garden is &#8216;Elda, and man&#8217;s expulsion from it is referred to only incidentally in connection with the statement that Enoch has been placed in the garden and will stay there till the Savior comes.</p>\n<p>[6.] A new beginning is apparently made with the statement, &#8220;This is the Book of Israel, concerning the greatness and the glory of the Sabbath of Israel.” The section that follows here speaks first of the institution of the rest day and gives a divine oracle concerning it, composed of exhortations and pre dictions as to the fate after death of those who disregard the Sabbath. Here the personification of the Sabbath begins. She rises from her seat in Heaven on Friday at dawn, the spirit of God descends, the angels crown her (duplicate statements suggest that several versions have been combined here) and bring her down from on high. Sabbath looks upon the souls of the just in the garden, causing them to rejoice, and even the sinners in Sheol love her, repentant over the evil they did on the Sabbath and hopeful that they may be brought up out of the place of torture. After some general statements about those who do the right thing on the Sabbath and further admonitions and assurances to them, the theme of deliverance from Sheol is continued. God commands Michael to go down to Sheol to bring out those in the nether world and give them a reprieve from the ninth hour of Friday until Sunday morning. But the hardened sinners apparently have to stay in Sheol, though they appeal to Michael for deliverance. Michael, following divine instructions, brings the souls of the just into the garden on the ninth hour of Friday. Here they are graciously received. Sabbath presents to God those &#8220;who believe in me and Thee&#8221; but apparently have no good works to rely on, and asks mercy for them; they receive the divine pity and are sent away with out humiliation. There is some further discussion of the kind of men who enter Paradise and who enjoy divine favor on the Day of Judgment, as well as of those who came out of Sheol or were brought up by Michael. Their punishment is considered preferable to Sheol. Observance of the Sabbath is enjoined and the angels of Heaven sing a song in praise of the divine victor.</p>\n<p>[7.] The next section begins, &#8220;These are the commandments of the Sabbath, etc.” After a restatement of the Sabbath rules there is a whole series of laws involving the death penalty, interrupted however by a section describing the blessedness of the Sabbath day. Then the personified Sabbath states that she was present at creation and asks not to be sent to the unjust. A declaration of God to Moses, again containing a list of transgressions with the death penalty, is given, and in conclusion there are some general observations contrasting the just and the unjust.</p>\n<p>[8.] The creation of an angel—the eagle Tāni—is next mentioned. He is sent to explore Gehenna. When he returns emaciated after a twenty-year absence he admits not having reached the end of it, but he gives God a description of the punishments of Hell.</p>\n<p>[9.] Then follows a predictive piece. On the day when God reprimands the children of Adam, Sabbath will stand at the entrance of Hell and appeal for special consideration for those who kept the Sabbath (whatever else they may have done); she will be given a favorable answer. Some mixed material, largely in praise of keeping the Sabbath, terminates this section.</p>\n<p>[10.] A new section is introduced by praise to God in which angels and earth and stars participate. God&#8217;s mercy to men is exemplified by biblical personages from Adam to Elisha. This is developed in detail. Once more we hear of Adam&#8217;s creation, of his being put in the Garden of Pleasure, and of his expulsion from it. Noah receives passing mention. This is followed by a reference to God&#8217;s mercy to Abraham. The story of the birth and youth of Abraham is related with special emphasis on his breaking his father&#8217;s idols. Terah sends him to Nimrod, king of Canaan, who attempts to make him worship idols and when unsuccessful throws Abra ham into the flames of an oven. God, however, sends Gabriel down to deliver the patriarch. The story of the sacrifice of Isaac is related next. We learn in connection with it that the horn of the ram that was substituted for Isaac will be blown by Elijah on Mount Zion and its blast will be heard to the ends of the earth on the Last Day.</p>\n<p>[11.] The significance of Adam&#8217;s fall is considered, but Moses&#8217; work, carried further by good priests, kings, and prophets, is viewed as putting us back in the garden of delight.</p>\n<p>[12.] The biblical story of the golden calf is told, and especially how the calf was ground to powder and the Israelites made to drink it; 20,700 who had given gold for making the calf died. Apparently, however, some 102,090 of the survivors separated themselves from the rest and arrived at the plain of &#8216;Iyārēwos, where they are imagined to abide still, alienated from God. It is not clear to whom the statement &#8220;Those who died were saints, and they shall be men of renown on the Last Day&#8221; refers.</p>\n<p>[13.] The personified Sabbath reappears. Attended by angels she worships the Creator on Friday morning. God converses with her and tells her that those who honor her honor Him. Sabbath praises the Lord and then leaves the camp of God attended by angels. They bring her to earth and report the deeds of men on the Sabbath day to God, who then rewards or punishes. God bids all people praise Him. Here follow some reflections and laws about the Sabbath day and the Sabbath year. The theme of Sabbath&#8217;s descent to earth on Friday at the ninth hour is resumed. She bids Michael, Gabriel, Rumā&#8217;ēl, and Uriel bring her those who are her own. This leads to a struggle with the hosts of Bērnā&#8217;ēl who are driven back to Sheol. Michael then ascends to Sabbath and reports on the struggle. Sabbath appeals to God to give her those who love her. God agrees. She promises to intercede for those who fear her on the Last Day, but those who disregard her will be seized by the hosts of Bērnā&#8217;ēl.</p>\n<p>[14.] There follow statements about God&#8217;s giving the Sabbath to Moses. However, Sabbath was with God from eternity, though not yet visible at the time when God&#8217;s spirit moved on the face of the waters. In the material that follows the personified Sabbath is not mentioned again. There is an account of the days of creation and of how God celebrated the Sabbath in Heaven on the seventh day and ordered the two kinds of angels to keep it, predicting, too, that he would take for his own a people from among all peoples that would keep the Sabbath.</p>\n<p>[15.] A transition to the history of Adam to Moses is then made, but that history is not elaborated on. An apocalyptic passage is introduced referring to the Ethiopian king, Gabra Masqal, and his successors and the eclipse of that line.</p>\n<p>[16.] Rather abruptly a commandment about bringing offerings on the fifth (?) day is introduced. Then follows narrative material. The angels, seeing that the Sabbath (?) was not sanctified on the fifth day, came before God apparently seeking to have the Sabbath for themselves. However, God rejected that request. He had not given the Sabbath even to his servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob! After the angels have praised God in all three Heavens he gives them their food, the manna. They eat and continue their praise of the Creator, standing at their places, while the doors of the house of God are open on New Moon and Sabbath. The earthly scene is then envisaged in more detail. The purpose of God&#8217;s creation of the Sabbath is pointed out, and a regulation about the seventh Sabbath after the Passover and the fiftieth day (Pentecost) is added. The angels are called upon to praise the man who observed the Sabbath.</p>\n<p>[17.] The personified Sabbath now descends to earth at Jerusalem and is received by Abel, Enoch, and Melchizedek and crowned by angels. There are explanations of the benefits gained by honoring her, and admonitions and promises from God who announces the glory of His name. A saying of God to Moses on the third Sabbath of the fifth month is reported.</p>\n<p>[18.] An apocalyptic piece is then introduced. When God questions men at the final assize Sabbath intercedes for those who were loyal to her. The text then passes into warnings and exhortations.</p>\n<p>[19.] Once more the theme of the creation of man is introduced. Man and woman were created in the first week, but woman was not shown to man until the second. They came into Eden on the fortieth and eightieth days respectively. These &#8220;facts&#8221; supposedly explain certain laws of purification. Incidents of patriarchal history are related which took place in the fourth and seventh months and thus apparently have particular dignity. The text ends with God&#8217;s declaration of his love for Abraham and his seed and a suitable benediction.</p>\n<h4>Sources</h4>\n<p>The sources are mostly Jewish, both biblical and extra-biblical. The most interesting and original part of the book is the concept of the Sabbath and the legends concerning her.</p>\n<p>The Sabbath is a holy entity. Various names are given her: Luminous, Vivifying, Rejoicing, Beloved, and Guardian. She is also called the &#8220;Sabbath of Israel,&#8221; and the &#8220;Sabbath of God.&#8221; She intercedes with God insistently, for both the righteous and the sinners. That the sinners rest in Hell on the Sabbath and are not punished on that day is well known in Jewish, Christian, and Moslem writings, and is often mentioned in the Commandments of the Sabbath. What characterizes our book is its originality and the picturesque description of how the Sabbath, crowned on that day by the angels, goes down to Sheol and delivers the sinners from their punishment.</p>\n<p>A Jewish source other than biblical and rabbinical for this material is the Book of Jubilees. In fact, various passages such as those dealing with the creation of the world, the ordinances concerning the defilement of the woman, the commandments of the Sabbath, and others are taken from the Book of the Jubilees. Several passages, especially those concerning the angels, are drawn from the Ethiopic Enoch.</p>\n<p>Occasionally one can find a Christian element, such as the mention of the Savior in connection with Enoch (&#8220;And Enoch will be there until the Savior comes&#8221;), and perhaps also that of the Sabbath rest of the sinners until Sunday morning, and of the offerings presented to Sabbath on Sunday. But on the whole Christian elements are insignificant, and it can safely be concluded that the Commandments of the Sabbath is strongly influenced by Jewish writings.</p>\n<p>Some legends amplifying various accounts of the Bible, such as the creation of Adam, the story of Abraham and his relation to Nimrod, and others, are of Arabic rather than Jewish origin. They may have been taken over either orally or from translations, but in any case are found here in a very corrupt form. For example, in the story of the creation of Adam angels are sent to take dust from the earth. The names of the angels are not the same as in the Arabic sources, but the whole account corresponds exactly to what we know from Arabic texts.</p>\n<p>Arabic origin can also be traced in the story of Nimrod who, in his desire to kill the God of Abraham, builds a high tower to reach the abode of God and then, seated in a palanquin carried by eagles, shot an arrow at someone he thought to be the God of Abraham. This account is Arabic and is related in our text in a very abridged and corrupt form.</p>\n<h4>Date of Composition</h4>\n<p>The date of this work can be determined only in a general way. The presence of influence from Christian-Arabic quarters suggests that it is not older than the fourteenth century. It is quite possible, of course, that the work contains materials which reach much further back. The extreme limit for any part of it would be the period of biblical translation from the fifth through the seventh centuries. It will be one of the tasks of future research to determine whether Jewish agadic materials or Christian sources furnish any clues that would make possible a more precise dating.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>[From a family of musicians, Isaac Gantwerk Mayer believes that creative art is one of the most powerful ways to get in touch with the divine.

The tower rose to a height of five thousand cubits; but as heaven was still far off, and the workmen were unable to proceed with the building, Nimrod caught two eagles and kept them upon the tower several days, and when they were ravenous with hunger, he fastened to their feet a light, closed palanquin, with one window above and another below, and seated himself in it with one of his huntsmen. The latter took a long spear, to which a bit of ﬂesh was attached, and thrust it through the upper window, so that the famished eagles ﬂew instantly upward bearing the palanquin aloft. When they had ﬂown toward heaven for a whole day Nimrod heard a voice which cried to him: &#8216;Godless man, whither goest thou?&#8217; Nimrod seized his huntsman&#8217;s bow, and discharged an arrow, which forthwith fell back through the window stained with blood, and this reprobate man believed that he had wounded the God of Abraham.&#8221;&nbsp;</span></span><script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery('#footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_178').tooltip({ tip: '#footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_178', tipClass: 'footnote_tooltip', effect: 'fade', predelay: 0, fadeInSpeed: 200, delay: 400, fadeOutSpeed: 200, position: 'center right', relative: true, offset: [0, 0], });</script> Abraham said: &#8220;My God dies not.

The tower rose to a height of five thousand cubits; but as heaven was still far off, and the workmen were unable to proceed with the building, Nimrod caught two eagles and kept them upon the tower several days, and when they were ravenous with hunger, he fastened to their feet a light, closed palanquin, with one window above and another below, and seated himself in it with one of his huntsmen. The latter took a long spear, to which a bit of ﬂesh was attached, and thrust it through the upper window, so that the famished eagles ﬂew instantly upward bearing the palanquin aloft. When they had ﬂown toward heaven for a whole day Nimrod heard a voice which cried to him: &#8216;Godless man, whither goest thou?&#8217; Nimrod seized his huntsman&#8217;s bow, and discharged an arrow, which forthwith fell back through the window stained with blood, and this reprobate man believed that he had wounded the God of Abraham.&#8221;</td></tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"footnotes_plugin_reference_row\"> <th scope=\"row\" id=\"footnote_plugin_reference__1_179\" class=\"footnote_plugin_index pointer\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor__1('footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_179');\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"footnote_plugin_link\" >179</a></th> <td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">To be read <em>yāqěttěl</em> instead of <em>ʾěqětěl</em>.</td></tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"footnotes_plugin_reference_row\"> <th scope=\"row\" id=\"footnote_plugin_reference__1_180\" class=\"footnote_plugin_index pointer\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor__1('footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_180');\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"footnote_plugin_link\" >180</a></th> <td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">The text has &#8220;them.&#8221;</td></tr>\r\n\r\n<tr class=\"footnotes_plugin_reference_row\"> <th scope=\"row\" id=\"footnote_plugin_reference__1_181\" class=\"footnote_plugin_index pointer\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToAnchor__1('footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_181');\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"footnote_plugin_link\" >181</a></th> <td class=\"footnote_plugin_text\">Beer, <em>Leben Abrahams, </em>p. 14; <em>Legends</em>, 1, 216.
