These haftarot are also substantially shorter than Babylonian norms, with some as short as three verses. It seems the Babylonian prohibition on hafṭarot shorter than twenty-one verses was not taken into account in the West! (It&#8217;s unclear whether this was a universal norm in the Land of Israel rite, or exclusive to the community that used this book.)</p>\n<p>* = part of the page is torn; portion is reconstructed
