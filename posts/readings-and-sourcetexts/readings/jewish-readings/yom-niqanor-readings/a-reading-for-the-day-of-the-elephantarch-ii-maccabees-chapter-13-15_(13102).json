This is probably the main reason that, unlike Chanukah and Purim, it was lost to Jewish practice for more than a thousand years. Nevertheless, we do have its megillah, which has been translated into Hebrew and English. Perhaps, if we start reading chapters 13-15 of 2 Maccabees, even just to ourselves, on the 13 of Adar, we can begin to resurrect a holiday that was celebrated and instituted by Judah Maccabee and his followers over two millennia ago, and which they envisioned would continue throughout Jewish History. With the return of Jews to Israel and Jewish sovereignty to Jerusalem, I believe it is about time.  . . .",
    "content": "<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\" style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">\nRabbi Dr. Zev Farber writes in <a href=\"http://thetorah.com/yom-nicanor-13th-of-adar/\">thetorah.com</a>,</p>\n<blockquote><p>Niqanor Day and its megillah did not fare as well as Purim, or even Ḥanukkah. Its book (2 Maccabees), in Greek, was unknown or discarded by the Rabbis, and its celebration died out with the rest of the Megillat Ta’anit holidays. Eventually, to add insult to injury, during the Geonic period the custom developed to fast on the day before Purim (Ta’anit Esther).<span class=\"footnote_referrer\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_1');\" onkeypress=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_1');\" ><sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_1\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\">[1]</sup></a><span id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_1\" class=\"footnote_tooltip\"> Megillat Esther mentions Esther calling all Jews of Shushan to observe a three day fast before she went to speak to the king, and a number of different Jewish fasting customs developed around commemorating these fasts. Some fasted for three days towards the end of Adar, some three days in Nissan (as it says in the Megillah). By the early second millennium C.E., the Babylonian custom of fasting on the day before Purim eventually became the dominant one. See Daniel Sperber, Minhagei Yisrael vol. 1, pp. 196-198, vol. 4 pp. 250-252 [Hebrew]. &nbsp;</span></span><script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery('#footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_1').tooltip({ tip: '#footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_1', tipClass: 'footnote_tooltip', effect: 'fade', predelay: 0, fadeInSpeed: 200, delay: 400, fadeOutSpeed: 200, position: 'center right', relative: true, offset: [0, 0], });</script>&nbsp; For years, as someone who studies the Book of Maccabees, I have found it very difficult not to think of the 13th of Adar as Niqanor Day as well as Ta’anit Esther. Most years, this dual definition feels very dissonant, which is one reason I cherish the years when Purim is on Sunday and Ta’anit Esther is pushed back to Thursday. This allows Niqanor Day, for those of us who mark it—we have it on our family calendar—to be treated as a day of celebration and feasting (as I believe it deserves).</p>\n<p>For our generation, Niqanor Day rounds out the other two Megillat Ta’anit holidays that survived. Purim is about surviving in exile. Ḥanukkah is about the escape from persecution. In both of these holidays, the Jews were coming from a place of weakness, with no leadership, no army and no hope. When Niqanor threatened the Temple, however, the situation was quite different. Judah Maccabee had an army and had defeated the Syrian Greeks in battle only a few years earlier. On one hand, the fact that the Judeans had been victorious previously makes the defeat of Niqanor feel less awe-inspiring than Judah’s first victory. Nevertheless, it underlines a challenging truth about Jewish history that we don’t often think about, especially on Ḥanukkah.</p>\n<p>Even though we end the story of the Maccabees with the rededication of the Temple, the story of the struggle against the Syrian-Greeks did not end there. Not by a long shot. (Just for illustrative purposes, Ḥanukkah appears in chapter 4 of 1 Maccabees; the book has 16 chapters.) In fact, Judah Maccabee is killed in battle against the Syrian-Greeks, as is his brother Jonathan, who took over after him. It is only during the time of Simon (another brother) that the battle is truly won. Even then, it was only a matter of time before the Romans came; that battle we lost. </p>\n<p>Niqanor Day celebrates a time when the Jews stood their ground against a force that would attack them again and again. We like to imagine quick decisive victories that happen once and last into the happily ever after, but that is not how things happen in real life. Judah Maccabee had to fight his entire life, and lose it, to keep the Temple safe and the Jews free. Each time was a struggle, less dramatic than Ḥanukkah but no less significant. To me, this is the meaning of Niqanor Day. I believe it has particular resonance in our times, considering the reality faced by the modern state of Israel. If Ḥanukkah is the 1948 War of Independence then Niqanor Day is either the 1967 Six Day War or the 1973 Yom Kippur War—the wars where Israel had to stand its ground or risk losing it all.<span class=\"footnote_referrer\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_2');\" onkeypress=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_2');\" ><sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_2\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\">[2]</sup></a><span id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_2\" class=\"footnote_tooltip\"> The success of the Six Day War is celebrated on Yom Yerushalayim (the 28th of Iyyar).&nbsp;</span></span><script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery('#footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_2').tooltip({ tip: '#footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_2', tipClass: 'footnote_tooltip', effect: 'fade', predelay: 0, fadeInSpeed: 200, delay: 400, fadeOutSpeed: 200, position: 'center right', relative: true, offset: [0, 0], });</script>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is challenging to think of how to mark Niqanor Day, as it remains at a disadvantage, not only on years when it conflicts with Ta’anit Esther but on all years since it has no mitzvot.
