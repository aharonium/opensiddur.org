    "content": "<style type=\"text/css\" media=\"all\">.printfriendly {display: none!important;}</style>\n<p>Through the frame of a mytho-historical chronicle narrated by an angel, Sefer haYovelim provides more than a gloss on most of Genesis through the giving of the Torah in Exodus. The unknown author presents a raison d&#8217;etre for the giving of the Torah itself in the context of world history, the human condition, and the existence of predation in Nature. It is one of the earliest pedagogical works (if not the earliest) explaining the purpose of Jewish teaching and practice to Jewish readers, in circumscribing the predatory passions that entered the world during the generation of the Flood. It is the earliest Jewish work providing a connection between the celebration of the festival of Shavuot (Pentecost) and the celebration of the giving of the Torah on Mt. Sinai. </p>\n<p>We are grateful to Dr. <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20160415140645/http://theology.nd.edu:80/people/faculty/james-c-vanderkam/\">James VanderKam</a> for preparing this critical text of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Jubilees\">Book of Jubilees</a> (<em>Sefer haYovelim</em>) in its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ge'ez_language\">Ge&#8217;ez</a> translation in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ge'ez_script\">Ethiopic script</a>. The book of Jubilees is an early Jewish deuterocanonical text composed in Hebrew during the Second Temple period sometime before the Maccabean struggle (167 BCE). In the introduction to his translation of Jubilees, Dr. VanderKam writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The present writer has argued at length that Jubilees was written between 161 and 152, while George Nickelsburg and Jonathan Goldstein have defended a date just before 167 B.C.[E.] on the grounds that the author betrays his knowledge of events that occurred in the first part of Antiochus IV&#8217;s reign but is not aware of his religious edict which was promulgated in 167&#8230;.<span class=\"footnote_referrer\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" onclick=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_1');\" onkeypress=\"footnote_moveToReference__1('footnote_plugin_reference__1_1');\" ><sup id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_1\" class=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text\">[1]</sup></a><span id=\"footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_1\" class=\"footnote_tooltip\"> NICKELSBURG, Jewish Literature Between the Bible and the Mishnah (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1981) 78-79; GOLDSTEIN, «The Date of the Book of Jubilees», PAAJR 50 (1983) 63-86. The apocalypse in Jubilees 23 plays a large part in these two attempts at dating.&nbsp;</span></span><script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery('#footnote_plugin_tooltip__1_1').tooltip({ tip: '#footnote_plugin_tooltip_text__1_1', tipClass: 'footnote_tooltip', effect: 'fade', predelay: 0, fadeInSpeed: 200, delay: 400, fadeOutSpeed: 200, position: 'center right', relative: true, offset: [0, 0], });</script>&nbsp; </p>\n<p>Today students of the book agree that it was composed in Hebrew and that from Hebrew it was translated into Greek. It has been suggested&#8230;that a Hebrew text also served as the base for a Syriac translation, but it is not certain that there was a full Syriac translation and that, if there was one, it rendered a Hebrew rather than a Greek model. Copies of the Greek version of Jubilees then became the Vorlagen of translations into Latin and Ethiopic.</p>\n<p>&#8230;.The only version which preserves the complete text of Jubilees is the Ethiopic. The book was apparently translated from Greek at an early stage in the development of Ethiopic literature and enjoyed canonical status in the Abyssinian Church.</p></blockquote>\n<hr />\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" class=\"draggable toggleable-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th id=\"x\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Ge&#8217;ez (translation)</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">English (secondary translation, VanderKam)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"ethiopic\" lang=\"gez-Ethi\">\nመጽሐፈ ኩፋሌ<br />\n</span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nMets&#8217;hafe Kufale (the Book of Division)\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"ethiopic\" lang=\"gez-Ethi\">\nዝንቱ ነገረ ኩፋሌ መዋዕላተ ሕግ ወለስምዕ ለግብረ ዓመታት ለተሳብዖቶሙ ለኢዮቤልውሳቲሆሙ ውስተ ኵሉ ዓመታተ ዓለም በከመ ተናገሮ ለሙሴ በደብረ ሲና አመ ዐርገ ይንሣእ ጽላተ እብን ሕግ ወትእዛዝ በቃለ እግዚአብሔር በከመ ይቤሎ ይዕርግ ውስተ ርእሰ ደብር።<br />\n</span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\nThese are the words regarding the divisions of the times of the law and of the testimony, of the events of the years, of the weeks of their jubilees throughout all the years of eternity as he related (them) to Moses on Mt.

I will give you the two stone tablets of the law and the commandments which I have written so that you may teach them». <sup>1:2</sup>&nbsp;So Moses went up the mountain of the Lord. The glory of the Lord took up residence on Mt. Sinai, and a cloud covered it for six days. <sup>1:3</sup>&nbsp;When he summoned Moses into the cloud on the seventh day, he saw the glory of the Lord like a fire blazing on the summit of the mountain. <sup>1:4</sup>&nbsp;Moses remained on the mountain for 40 days and 40 nights while the Lord showed him what (had happened) beforehand as well as what was to come. He related to him the divisions of all the times — both of the law and of the testimony. <sup>1:5</sup>&nbsp;He said to him: «Pay attention to all the words which I tell you on this mountain. Write (them) in a book so that their offspring may see that I have not abandoned them because of all the evil they have done in straying from the covenant between me and you which I am making today on Mt. Sinai for their offspring. <sup>1:6</sup>&nbsp;So it will be that when all of these things befall them they will recognize that I have been more faithful than they in all their judgments and in all their actions.

The woman is to be burned because she has defiled the reputation of her father&#8217;s house; she is to be uprooted from Israel. <sup>30:8</sup>&nbsp;No adulterer or impure person is to be found within Israel throughout all the time of the earth&#8217;s history, for Israel is holy to the Lord. Any man who has defiled (it) is to die; he is to be stoned. <sup>30:9</sup>&nbsp;For this is the way it has been ordained and written on the heavenly tablets regarding any descendant of Israel who defiles (it): &#8216;He is to die; he is to be stoned&#8217;. <sup>30:10</sup>&nbsp;This law has no temporal limit. There is no remission or any forgiveness; but rather the man who has defiled his daughter within all of Israel is to be eradicated because he has given one of his descendants to Molech and has sinned by defiling them.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"ethiopic\" lang=\"gez-Ethi\">\n<sup>30:11</sup>&nbsp;ወአንተኒ ሙሴ አዝዞሙ ለደቂቀ እስራኤል ወአስምዕ ላዕሌሆሙ ከመ ኢየሀቡ እምነ አዋልዲሆሙ ለአሕዛብ ወከመ ኢይንሥኡ እምአዋልደ አሕዛብ እስመ ምኑን ውእቱ በቅድመ እግዚአብሔር። <sup>30:12</sup>&nbsp;በእንተዝ ጸሐፍኩ ለከ ውስተ ቃለ ሕግ ኵሎ ግብሮሙ ለሰቂማ ዘገብሩ ላዕለ ዲና ወዘከመ ተናገሩ ደቁ ለያዕቆብ እንዘ ይብሉ ኢንሁብ ወለተነ ለሰብእ ዘቦ ቍልፈተ እስመ ጽዕለት ውእቱ ለነ <sup>30:13</sup>&nbsp;ወጽዕለት ውእቱ ለእስራኤል ለእለ ይሁቡ ወለእለ ይነሥኡ እምነ አዋልደ አሕዛብ እስመ ርኩስ ውእቱ ወምኑን ውእቱ እምእስራኤል። <sup>30:14</sup>&nbsp;ወኢይነጽሕ እስራኤል እምዝ ርኵስ ዘቦ ብእሲተ እምነ አዋልደ አሕዛብ። ወእመቦ እምአዋልዲሁ ዘወሀቦ ለብእሲ እምኵሉ አሕዛብ <sup>30:15</sup>&nbsp;እስመ መቅሠፍት ላዕለ መቅሠፍት ውእቱ ወመርገም ላዕለ መርገም ወኵሉ ኵነኔ ወመቅሠፍት ወመርገም ይመጽእ። ወለእመ ገብረ ዘቃለ ወለእመ ተዐወረ አዕይንቲሁ እምእሉ እለ ይገብሩ ርኵሰተ ወእለ ያረኵሱ መቅደሶ ለእግዚአብሔር ወእምእለ ይጌምኑ ስሞ ቅዱሰ ይትኴነን ኵሉ ሕዝብ ኀቡረ በእንተ ኵሉ ዝርኵስ ወግማኔ ዛቲ። <sup>30:16</sup>&nbsp;ወአልቦ ነሢአ ገጽ ወአልቦ አድልዎ ለገጽ ወአልቦ ነሢአ እምእዴሁ ፍሬ ወመሥዋዕተ ወጽንሐሐ ወስብሐ ወተምዕዞ መዓዛ ሠናይ ከመ ይትወከፎ። ወይኩን ኵሉ ብእሲ ወብእሲት በውስተ እስራኤል ዘያረኵስ መቅደሶ። <sup>30:17</sup>&nbsp;በእንተዝ አዘዝኩከ እንዘ እብል አስምዕ ዛተ ስምዐ ላዕለ እስራኤል። ርኢ ዘከመ ኮነ ለሰቂሞን ወለውሉዳ ዘከመ ተውህበት ውስተ እደ ክልኤሆሙ ደቂቀ ያዕቆብ ወቀተልዎሙ በጻዕር ወኮነቶሙ ጽድቀ ወተጽሕፎሙ ለጽድቅ። <sup>30:18</sup>&nbsp;ወተኀርየ ዘርአ ሌዊ ለክህነት ወለሌዋዊያን ከመ ይትለአኩ ቅድመ እግዚአብሔር ከመ ንሕነ በኵሉ መዋዕል። ወይትባረክ ሌዊ ወውሉዱ ለዓለም እስመ ቀንአ ከመ ይግበር ጽድቀ ወኵነኔ ወበቀለ እምኵሎሙ እለ ይትነሥኡ ላዕለ እስራኤል <sup>30:19</sup>&nbsp;ወከመዝ ያዐርጉ ሎቱ በስምዕ ውስተ ጽላተ ሰማይ በረከተ ወጽድቀ ቅድሜሁ ለአምላከ ኵሉ። <sup>30:20</sup>&nbsp;ወንዜክር ንሕነ ጽድቀ ዘገብረ ሰብእ በሕይወቱ በኵሉ ጊዜያት ዘዓመት እስከ ዐሠርቱ ምእት ትውልድ ያዐርጉ ወይመጽእ ሎቱ ወለትውልዱ እምድኅሬሁ ወተጽሕፈ ዐርከ ወጻድቀ ውስተ ጽላተ ሰማይ።<br />\n</span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\n<sup>30:11</sup>&nbsp;Now you, Moses, order the Israelites and testify to them that they are not to give any of their daughters to foreigners and that they are not to marry any foreign women because it is despicable before the Lord. <sup>30:12</sup>&nbsp;For this reason I have written for you in the words of the law everything that the Shechemites did to Dinah and how Jacob&#8217;s sons said: &#8216;We will not give our daughter to a man who has a foreskin because for us that would be a disgraceful thing&#8217;. <sup>30:13</sup>&nbsp;It is a disgraceful thing for the Israelites who give or take (in marriage) one of the foreign women because it is too impure and despicable for Israel. <sup>30:14</sup>&nbsp;Israel will not become clean from this impurity while it has one of the foreign women or if anyone has given one of his daughters to any foreign man. <sup>30:15</sup>&nbsp;For it is blow upon blow and curse upon curse. Every punishment, blow, and curse will come. If one does this or shuts his eyes to those who do impure things and who defile the Lord&#8217;s sanctuary and to those who profane his holy name, then the entire nation will be condemned together because of all this impurity and this contamination. <sup>30:16</sup>&nbsp;There will be no favoritism nor partiality; there will be no receiving from him of fruit, sacrifices, offerings, fat, or the aroma of a pleasing fragrance so that he should accept it. (So) is any man or woman in Israel to be who defiles his sanctuary. <sup>30:17</sup>&nbsp;For this reason I have ordered you: &#8216;Proclaim this testimony to Israel: «See how it turned out for the Shechemites and their children — how they were handed over to Jacob&#8217;s two sons. They killed them in a painful way. It was a just act for them and was recorded as a just act for them». <sup>30:18</sup>&nbsp;Levi&#8217;s descendants were chosen for the priesthood and as levites to serve before the Lord as we (do) for all time. Levi and his sons will be blessed forever because he was eager to carry out justice, punishment, and revenge on all who rise against Israel. <sup>30:19</sup>&nbsp;So blessing and justice before the God of all are entered for him as a testimony on the heavenly tablets. <sup>30:20</sup>&nbsp;We ourselves remember the justice which the man performed during his lifetime at all times of the year.

From the time he came from Haran until today he has not deprived us of anything but he always brings us everything in its season. He is wholeheartedly happy when we accept (anything) from him, and he blesses us. He has not separated from us from the day he came from Haran until today. He has continually been living with us at home (all the while) honoring us&#8217;. <sup>35:13</sup>&nbsp;Isaac said to her. &#8216;I, too, know and see the actions of Jacob who is with us — that he wholeheartedly honors us. At first I did love Esau more than Jacob, after he was born; but now I love Jacob more than Esau because he has done so many bad things and lacks (the ability to do) what is right. For the entire way he acts is (characterized by) injustice and violence and there is no justice about him. <sup>35:14</sup>&nbsp;Now my mind is disturbed about his actions. Neither he nor his descendants are to be saved because they will be destroyed from the earth and be uprooted from beneath the sky.

May they love one another as themselves. <sup>36:5</sup>&nbsp;Regarding the matter of idols, I am instructing you to reject them, to be an enemy of them, and not to love them because they are full of errors for those who worship them and who bow to them. <sup>36:6</sup>&nbsp;My sons, remember the Lord, the God of your father Abraham (afterwards I, too, worshiped and served him properly and sincerely) so that he may make you numerous and increase your descendants in number like the stars of the sky and plant you in the earth as a righteous plant which will not be uprooted throughout all the history of eternity. <sup>36:7</sup>&nbsp;Now I will make you swear with the great oath — because there is no oath which is greater than it, by the praiseworthy, illustrious, and great, splendid, marvelous, powerful, and great name which made the heavens and the earth and everything together — that you will continue to fear and worship him, <sup>36:8</sup>&nbsp;as each loves his brother kindly and properly. One is not to desire what is bad for his brother now and forever, throughout your entire lifetime, so that you may be prosperous in everything that you do and not be destroyed. <sup>36:9</sup>&nbsp;If one of you aims at what is bad for his brother, be aware that from now on anyone who aims at what is bad for his brother will fall into his control and will be uprooted from the land of the living, while his descendants will be destroyed from beneath the sky. <sup>36:10</sup>&nbsp;On the day of turmoil and curse, of anger and wrath — with a blazing fire that devours — he will burn his land, his city, and everything that belongs to him just as he burned Sodom. He will be erased from the disciplinary book of mankind. He will not be entered in the book of life but in the one that will be destroyed. He will pass over to an eternal curse so that their punishment may always be renewed with denunciation and curse, with anger, pain, and wrath, and with blows and eternal sickness. <sup>36:11</sup>&nbsp;I am reporting and testifying to you, my sons, in accord with the punishment which will come on the man who wishes to do what is harmful to his brother&#8217;.\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"ethiopic\" lang=\"gez-Ethi\">\n<sup>36:12</sup>&nbsp;ወከፈለ ኵሎ ዘቦ ጥሪቶ ለክልኤሆሙ በይእቲ ዕለት ወወሀበ ዕበየ ለብእሲ ዘውእቱ ቀደመ ተወልዶ ወማኅፈደ ኵሎ ዘአውዳ። ወኵሎ ዘአጥረየ አብርሃም በኀበ ዐዘቅተ መሐላ <sup>36:13</sup>&nbsp;ወይቤ ዛተ አዐቢ ዕበየ ለብእሲ ዘውእቱ ቀደመ ተወልዶ። <sup>36:14</sup>&nbsp;ወይቤ ዔሳው ሤጥኩ ሎቱ ለያዕቆብ ወወሀብኩ ልህቃንየ ለያዕቆብ ይትወሀብ ሎቱ ወአልብየ ዘእብል በእንቲአሃ ምንተኒ ቃለ እስመ ኀቤሁ ሀለወት። <sup>36:15</sup>&nbsp;ወይቤ ይስሐቅ ታዕርፍ ዲቤክሙ ውሉድየ በረከት ወላዕለ ዘርእክሙ በዛቲ ዕለት እስመ አዕረፍክሙኒ ወኢሐዘነ ልብየ በእንተ ልህቃን ከመ ኢትግበር በእንቲአሃ ፁገ <sup>36:16</sup>&nbsp;ይባርኮ እግዚአብሔር ልዑል ለብእሲ ዘይገብር ጽድቀ ኪያሁ ወዘርኡ እስከ ለዓለም። <sup>36:17</sup>&nbsp;ወፈጸመ እንዘ ይኤዝዞሙ ወእንዘ ይባርኮሙ ወበልዑ ወሰትዩ በቅድሜሁ ኅቡረ ወተፈሥሐ እስመ ኮነ ዐርዮ በማእከሎሙ ወወፅኡ እምኀቤሁ ወአዕረፉ ይእተ ዕለተ ወኖሙ። <sup>36:18</sup>&nbsp;ወኖመ ይስሐቅ ውስተ ዐራቱ በዛቲ ዕለት እንዘ ይትፌሣሕ ወኖመ ንዋመ ዘለዓለም። ወሞተ ወልደ ምእት ወሰማንያ ዓመት ዕሥራ ወኀምስ ሱባዔ ፈጸመ ወኀምስተ ዓመተ። ወቀበርዎ ክልኤሆሙ ውሉዱ ዔሳው ወያዕቆብ።<br />\n</span></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<div class=\"english\" lang=\"eng-Latn\">\n<sup>36:12</sup>&nbsp;That day he divided all the property that he owned between the two of them.
