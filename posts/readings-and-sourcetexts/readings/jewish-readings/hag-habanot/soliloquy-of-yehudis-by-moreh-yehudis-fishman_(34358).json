that young Rivkah brought the fire back<br />\nas soon as her feet skipped past the door of Sarah’s tent.<br />\nHow then can you allow<br />\nour direct currents of holiness to be defiled?<br />\nAnd was it for nothing that Yaacov crossed the Yabok<br />\nto retrieve from the shamen of the future,<br />\na tiny cruse of oil,<br />\nfound in wonder when twelve stones merged?<br />\nCould his sons who were embedded in those stones<br />\nhave even begun to grow<br />\nwithout four maternal flames<br />\nwhose tongues brought forth tribal names<br />\nin flares of prophecy?<br />\nDid father
