<h3>Additions to the Birkat Hamazon</h3>

This <em>Haraḥaman</em> (prayer to the merciful or compassionate One) for the <em>Shmitah</em> or sabbatical year can be added to Birkat Hamazon (blessing after meals) during the whole Shmitah year, in order to remember and open our hearts to the sanctity of the land. Say it right before the Harachaman for Shabbat, since Shmitah is the grand shabbat, and right after the paragraph beginning with <em>Bamarom</em> (a/k/a, <em>Mimarom</em>).

Here's a <em>niggun</em> (melody) by Nili Simḥai for the haraḥaman, sung by Rabbi David Seidenberg.

For your festive meal, you can also print out <a href="http://neohasid.org/pdf/Shmita-Harachaman.pdf">this PDF</a> and add the Haraḥaman prayer to your <em>birkon</em> (benscher).

<h3>Addition to the Rosh Hashanah Seder</h3>

Many people eat special foods as part of a mini-seder at the beginning of the Rosh Hashanah meal and invoke blessings for the year as they eat them. This year, you can add figs to your Rosh Hashanah seder (apples and honey, or apples, dates, beets, etc.) and recite with this <em>kavanah</em> (intention):

"In the year of Shmita, the sabbatical year, our ancestors would let the land rest from their plows, receiving and eating whatever grew and ripened by itself from the land. And fig trees were especially prized in Shmita, because they would ripen little by little over many months, always providing food. And some say that the fig was the fruit of the tree of knowledge, and that Shmita is our time to receive the knowledge from Eden in the right way and the right time, when all us ripened toward understanding.

"May it be Your will YHVH our God and God of our ancestors that during this year of Shmita, as the world ripens for us little by little, always turning again toward us to nourish and sustain us, that may we turn to receive in gratitude what is offered so freely and lovingly, so that we may turn and ripen in justice and love toward this world and all its creatures." (Eat the fig!)

<h3>High Holiday Liturgy Tweaks</h3>

Two suggestions for <em>ḥazanim</em> (cantors) and <em>shliḥei tzibur</em> on the High Holidays:

1) In the <em>Hayom piyut</em>, add "<em>hayom tishm'tenu ligulah</em>" -- "the day of our release" (note -- the phrases come in alphabetical order) הַיוֹם תִּשְׁמְטֵנוּ לִגְאוּלָה.

2) In the <em>piyut</em> that comes at the end of some amidot on YK and RH (e.g. Sepharadi minḥa Kaddish Shalem, beginning "<em>sha`arei orah</em>" etc.) add "<em>sha`arei sh'mitah</em>" שַׁעֲרֵי שְׁמִיטָה.
