Nomi Lerman and I were co-teacher's this past season at <a href="http://www.kolotchayeinu.org">Kolot 拷바yeinu</a>'s <a href="http://www.kolotchayeinu.org/node/34">children's learning program</a> in Park Slope Brooklyn this past season, and as a 拷바nukkah present we made a <em>拷바nukkah Madrikh</em> for our Kittah Gimmel class. I'm certain there are Jewish educators all over the world preparing curricular resources for 拷바nukkah right about now. We hope that by sharing this they can take it and improve on it, or else we'll save them some energy so they'll be able to do even more mitzvot.
