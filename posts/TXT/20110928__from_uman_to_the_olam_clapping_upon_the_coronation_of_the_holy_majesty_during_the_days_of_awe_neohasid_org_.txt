During the ten days from Rosh Hashanah to Yom Kippur, we change the third blessing of the Amidah from "Blessed be You, the Holy God" <em>ha'el hakadosh</em> to "Blessed be You, the Holy King" hamelekh hakadosh. In Uman, Ukraine (and in the Breslov community in general) during the repetition of Rosh Hashanah <em>Musaf</em>, when the ḥazan gets to the special brokha in the Amidah for <em>Yamim Nora'im</em> [the Days of Awe]: <em>Barukh Atah Adonai Hamelekh Hakadosh</em>, something beautiful happens. Everyone begins clapping for the King, and it continues for minutes on end. It sounds corny, but in a shul of 3,000, it's awesome. Not only awesome, but truly joyful.

This is something anyone, any minyan, can do —- no Hebrew knowledge necessary. It works best when most of the people do it, and it is truly wonderful. I can't think of a more playful way to take what we say in prayer seriously.

Clapping for God – try it in Long Island and Iowa. It's not just for Uman!
