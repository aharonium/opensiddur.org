This is not a singular act of hatred,

By targeting a church with both antisemitic images and racist language, 
these vandals accidentally pointed to a truth we know too well: 
hatred against one is hatred against all.

"We all live with the objective of being happy; 
our lives are all different and yet the same."[foot]Cf.

"A Prayer for Church of the Nazarene, Iowa City" was written by Rabbi Menachem Creditor in response to <a href="https://littlevillagemag.com/vigil-scheduled-for-tuesday-night-to-show-support-for-iowa-city-church-vandalized-with-swastikas/">vandalsim of the church with hateful graffiti</a> on March 2nd 2019. According to the Iowa City/Cedar Rapids Little Village Mag, "The building also houses IC Compassion, a faith-based nonprofit that provides services to immigrants." The verse cited in the graffiti appears to be Proverbs 2:16 set next to a swastika. Clearly, the vandals had not read Proverbs 2:1-15 (emphasis on Proverbs 2:15). --Aharon Varady

The prayer was shared with the Open Siddur Project through its <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/opensiddur/permalink/10156415131127746/">Facebook discussion group</a>.
