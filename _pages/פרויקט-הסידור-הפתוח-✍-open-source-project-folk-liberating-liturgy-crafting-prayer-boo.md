<div class="english">
Imagine a library of Jewish prayer shared by everyone in the world designing and crafting their own siddur.

Imagine an open database of Jewish prayers showing historical variations and changes across Jewish traditions, manuscripts, and facsimile editions. 

Imagine the siddur as a record of your family's and community's <em>minhagim</em> and <em>nusaḥ</em> tweaked exactly to your needs -- a siddur, custom designed by you, that integrates your practice with your learning -- from your own experience, your teachers, friends, family, and the complete corpus of Jewish tradition.

Our collaborative, open-source project is working to create a <em>libre</em> open access database of Jewish prayer -- historic and contemporary, familiar and obscure -- in every language Jews pray or have ever prayed. We are building a complete end-to-end system for producing high-quality Jewish prayer books, for paper publication or for sharing online. We envision a system robust enough for use by academic researchers, Jewish educators, and DIY crafters. <a href="http://opensiddur.org/contact/">Join our project</a>. 

If you can write a simple script, join our development team. <a href="https://github.com/opensiddur/opensiddur/wiki/Building">Obtain the source code and start building, here</a>! Source code for alpha-ready <a href="http://app.opensiddur.org">Open Siddur application</a> is available from <a href="https://github.com/opensiddur">our github repositories</a>.

<a href="http://opensiddur.org/contribute/upload/">Contribute new prayers or translations of historic prayers</a>.

Can you transcribe or proofread? We have a number of works awaiting <a title="Transcribe with us" href="http://opensiddur.org/tools/transcribe/">transcription and proofreading</a>. Some works are in Hebrew, but we're also working on transcribing work in Arabic, German, French, Marathi, English, and Yiddish.

Take a look at the prayers, translations, exercises, art, and recordings that folk are already sharing with open content licenses that permit their creative reuse. That means that you can use these works right now in the creation of new siddurim (alas, offline) while we continue developing the Open Siddur web application.
