As an open source and free software project, the Open Siddur would not be possible at all were it not for the work of its volunteer developers, transcribers, translators, commentators, artists, designers, and boosters.

We look forward to acknowledging <em>you</em>. Please join our community and <a href="http://opensiddur.org/contribute/">contribute</a> to the Open Siddur by transcribing or translating texts, researching, providing art and comments, sharing ideas, or if you have technical skills, helping us build the Open Siddur web application. If you would like to support the Open Siddur Project financially, tax free donations can be made via a <a href="http://www.razoo.com/story/theopensiddurproject">donation page</a> sponsored by Center for Jewish Culture and Creativity, a 501(3)c non-profit providing the Open Siddur with fiscal sponsorship.

Aharon Varady, who first <a href="http://aharon.varady.net/omphalos/2002/08/update-2002-08-08">outlined the project in 2002</a>, directs the Open Siddur and administers, curates, and provides light-touch editing for all the content on opensiddur.org. Aharon's work on the Open Siddur Project is financially supported through his boutique publishing house, <a href="http://dimus.parrhesia.press">Dimus Parrhesia Press</a>.

Efraim Feinstein is the lead developer of the effort to create the <a href="http://app.opensiddur.org">Open Siddur application</a>, a web-based app for folk to craft their own siddur from a database of carefully tagged liturgy and liturgy-related work.

We would like to thank the following organizations and individuals for their early help in publicly launching the project.

<h3>PresenTense Institute</h3>

In the summer of 2009, the Open Siddur was one of sixteen innovative projects chosen for participation in the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160626153919/http://presentense.org/institute/2009">PresenTense Institute 2009 Summer Workshop</a> for Jewish social entrepreneurship in Jerusalem. Aharon Varady was selected as the Rena and Josh Kopelman Chair of Online Community Organizing, an honor presented by the <a href="http://www.kopelman.org/">Kopelman Foundation</a>, and the Open Siddur is grateful for their sponsorship of his work at PresenTense. We deeply appreciate the participation and interest of the PresenTense staff in the public launch of Open Siddur: Ariel Beery, Aharon Horwitz, Brachie Sprung, Shai Davis, and Brian Blumenthal. Their skill building advice, ideas, and ability to connect us with helpful collaborators was extremely useful and made for a productive summer. We would also like to thank the advice and support provided at that time by J.T. Waldman and Avi Warshavsky (Director of Israel's Center for Educational Technology Department of Humanities). Many thanks to J.T. Waldman, modest travel grants to attend the workshop were provided by the <a href="http://jewishphilly.org">Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia</a> and the <a href="https://jps.org/">Jewish Publication Society</a>.
