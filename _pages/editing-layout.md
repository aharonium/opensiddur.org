<h3>Digital Hebrew Fonts supporting the full range of Hebrew Diacritical Marks</h3>

Before editing Hebrew text, make sure you have installed on your Operating System some attractive Unicode Hebrew fonts that support the full range of Hebrew text with diacritical marks (ti'amim and niqudot). Download our<a href="http://opensiddur.org/craft/unicode-compliant-and-open-source-licensed-hebrew-fonts/"> Open Siddur Open-source Unicode Hebrew font pack</a>.


<h3>Editing Unformatted Hebrew Text</h3>

You may find, that before formatting Hebrew text, it can be very helpful to use a simple text editor to type or edit unformatted Hebrew text with diacritical marks (t'amim and niqudot). With a simple text editor that properly supports Unicode (UTF-8), you can easily see where there might be duplicate marks, spaces, and other unnecessary formatting. 

For Windows users, we recommend <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> configured with John Hudson's <a href="http://www.sbl-site.org/educational/BiblicalFonts_SBLHebrew.aspx">SBL Hebrew font</a>.

For Mac users, please <a href="http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/utilities_editors_macosx.html">consult this page</a>. <a href="http://opensiddur.org/contact/">Let us know</a> what works best for you.

If you use Linux, you might already have a favorite editor. <a href="http://opensiddur.org/contact/">Let us know</a> what's worked best for you.


<h3>Formatting Hebrew Text in a Word Processor</h3>

Formatting Hebrew text with diacritics and having it displayed correctly in the word processor often depends on the software and operating system you are using. On Linux and Windows, <a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/download/"><img src="http://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Libreoffice_icon_mix.png" alt="" title="Libreoffice_icon_mix" width="167" height="256" class="alignright size-full wp-image-4658" /></a>you don't need to purchase expensive software for offline work with Hebrew -- not since the amazing open source programmers behind LibreOffice, the <a href="http://www.documentfoundation.org/">Document Foundation</a>, developed a free and open source solution for working with Right-to-Left texts like Hebrew.[ref]<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libreoffice">LibreOffice is a fork of the OpenOffice suite</a> containing many improvements including increased support for RTL languages.[/ref] Until the Open Siddur web application is available for crafting siddurim and other curricular resources on Jewish liturgy, we recommend LibreOffice.[ref]Mac users have long relied on <a href="http://www.mellel.com/">Mellel</a>, which while closed source and commercial, has also proven itself dependable. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the OS X operating system support for non-Western languages, unspecialized software often fails to position Hebrew diacritics correctly.[/ref]

LibreOffice is a free/libre office suite containing a powerful and user-friendly text editor: LibreOffice Writer. LibreOffice is cross-platform -- it can be installed and run on Linux, Macintosh,[ref]Please, <a href="http://opensiddur.org/contact/">let us know</a> if Hebrew with diacritical marks is displaying properly in the latest OS X.[/ref] and Windows operating systems. 

Unlike many other text-based applications LibreOffice natively supports open standards and document formats. That way, what you type today should still be readable in the digital world twenty or a hundred years from now. Also, unlike many other text editors it correctly positions <em>niqqud</em>/vowels and <em>t'amim</em>/cantillation when using Hebrew fonts that correctly support the full range of Hebrew diacritics.
