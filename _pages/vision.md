The Open Siddur Project envisions Jewish spirituality as a shared and collaborative project that is rooted in the wisdom of our traditions and which finds expression through the evolving diversity of our communities and the intimate experiences of our individual relationships. Much like the <em>mishkan</em>, the traveling tent of meeting (or tabernacle) was the focal point for those creatively inspired Israelites to share their work, <span class="hebrew" lang="he">כֹּל אֲשֶׁר נַשָׂא לִבַּם</span>, <em>as their hearts were stirred</em> (Exodus 36:2), so too we see the Open Siddur Project as a kind of <span class="hebrew" lang="he">יִחוּד</span>, a unification of holy <span class="hebrew" lang="he">כַּוָּנוֹת</span> (intentions) for those sharing their <span class="hebrew" lang="he">חִדּוּשִׁים</span> (innovations) in Jewish spiritual practice, in sacred liturgy, in meditations and exercises, and in understanding through translations and commentary. In an age when our <span class="hebrew" lang="he">עֲבוֹדָה</span> <em>avodah</em> (intentional practice) is expressed by communities and individuals in a multiplicity of ways, it behooves us to take our <em>avodah</em> seriously, respect and reflect this diversity, and provide the means for crafting newly designed <span class="hebrew" lang="he">סִידּוּרִים</span> <em>Siddurim</em> accordingly. The Open Siddur Project is a community, space, and licensing framework for sharing those designs and enrich our individual and communal <em>avodah</em> with each other's creativity and insight.

The technology for engaging in a regular Jewish spiritual practice, like <em>davvening</em> for instance, only requires one to have an open heart, or the desire to have an open heart. No siddur is really necessary. And yet, a technology for accessing a set arrangement of techniques, formulations, exercises, and meditations can be very helpful for practitioners both adept and novice. Essentially, the <span class="hebrew" lang="he">סִידוּר</span> <em>Siddur</em> is a bound reference book containing not only the established sequence of liturgy used by a <em>ḥazzan</em> leading communal prayer, but also many other useful arrangements for Jewish spiritual practice alone or at home. The great variety of extant siddurim is testament to the diversity of Jewish communal traditions. Until now, it was extremely difficult to create one's own siddur, collecting an arrangement reflecting an individuals own evolving engagement in Jewish spirituality. By converting Public Domain print resources and newly composed contemporary works to digital resources encoded in standard open formats, we can create a powerful means by which individuals and communities take ownership of their practice and make meaning through direct engagement with the ingredients of Jewish spiritual resources. The scope of this digitization is immense: we seek to digitize every manuscript witnessing a formulation of a prayer and variations in arrangements and selection representing every liturgical custom or <em>nusaḥ.</em>

To accomplish this vast feat, it only makes sense that we use the best possible strategy for online collaboration: adopting open source and free/libre licensing for sharing our collective efforts. The Open Siddur Project is dedicated to providing the resources for crafting new siddurim, sharing siddur related content, and providing an innovative resource for studying the depth and breadth of Jewish liturgy and Jewish spiritual practice.

We are creating a framework for liturgists, translators, commentators, and Jews who simply want to pray from their heart to adopt, adapt, and redistribute each other's work.

<h3>The Open Siddur Project's Web Application</h3>

Our first effort is in building an online community workspace for users to prepare <em>siddurim</em> and other high quality Jewish reference works (such as <em>haggadot</em> and <em>benschers</em>) to be printed out, shared online, or accessed via e-readers. We think of this workspace like a kitchen, since we are making available the ingredients, recipes, and arrangements which can be freely modified by anyone producing a reference work very similar to a cookbook.

It will be a collaborative digital-to-print, on-demand publishing platform: collaborative like a wiki but designed with the ultimate goal of generating print media. This workspace will provide all the content and features necessary for folk to compile and edit for themselves all the components of a siddur including prayers, translations, commentaries, art, and layout templates for incorporation in new, custom designed <em>siddurim</em>. The application we are building could also be used simply as a novel educational tool for the study of Jewish liturgy.

<h3>Summary</h3>

In short, the work of project volunteers falls into the following general categories:

<strong>Collecting and preparing texts (liturgies, translations, commentaries, etc.), illustrations, and other siddur-related content</strong>
<ul>
	<li><a title="Imaging" href="http://opensiddur.org/contribute/document-manuscript-imaging/">Imaging</a> Public Domain works,</li>
	<li><a title="Transcription" href="http://opensiddur.org/tools/transcribe/">Transcribing</a> those materials,</li>
	<li><a title="Proofreading" href="http://opensiddur.org/tools/transcribe/">Proofreading</a> them for accuracy,</li>
	<li>and <a href="https://github.com/opensiddur/opensiddur/wiki/Open-Siddur-Guidelines-for-Transcription">Encoding</a> their semantic data into liturgy database.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Developing technology to facilitate sharing and creativity</strong>:
<ul>
	<li><a title="JLPTEI" href="https://github.com/opensiddur/opensiddur/wiki/JLPTEI-101:-00:-Introduction">specifications</a> of the XML-based format in which we archive the project's texts,</li>
	<li><a title="Architecture" href="https://github.com/opensiddur/opensiddur/wiki/Architecture">transforms</a> to convert the XML-encoded documents into print-ready or display-ready formats,</li>
	<li>the <a class="external text" title="http://www.exist-db.org" href="http://www.exist-db.org" rel="nofollow">server</a> to serve liturgy and related work from our database,</li>
	<li>and the web-based <a title="Open Siddur client interface" href="https://github.com/opensiddur/opensiddur-client">client</a> used by volunteers for editing, retrieving and remixing these texts.</li>
</ul>
and <strong>Communicating the principles of sharing as the basis of a vital, creative culture</strong>:
<ul>
	<li>Advocating the use of <a href="http://opensiddur.org/copyright-policy/">free-culture compatible Open Content licenses</a> to share resources across the span of Jewish cultural and educational projects</li>
	<li>Educating user-generated content projects on the necessity of using free-culture compatible Open Content licensing for empowering creative collaboration under Copyright</li>
	<li>Requesting authors, scholars, and artists to <a title="Submissions HOWTO" href="http://opensiddur.org/contribute/upload/">share</a> their work with free-culture compatible Open Content licensing (a/k/a, Open Access)</li>
	<li>Modeling best practices in Open Source sharing through the design and licensing of work we produce</li>
</ul>
