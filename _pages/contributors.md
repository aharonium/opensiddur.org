The Open Siddur Project is a volunteer-driven collaboration between folk passionate about Jewish spiritual practice. Some are interested in the Siddur as a technology for preserving and disseminating an evolving history of Jewish ritual, practice, and sacred poetry. Others are energized by the design challenge of crafting Siddurim that function effectively for nurturing spiritual, emotional and creative intelligence. All of us see the potential that creative engagement holds for empowering students and teachers to take ownership of those ingredients comprising their shared cultural inheritance.

The Open Siddur is a non-prescriptive, non-denominational project whose only intent is to help revitalize Judaism by ensuring its collective spiritual resources — the creative content intended for communal use — remain free for creative reuse. The Open Siddur Project invites participation without prejudice towards ethnic heritage, skin color, nationality, belief or non-belief, sex, gender, sexuality or any other consideration. All we ask for is an intellectually honest commitment to the principles and sensibilities preserved in our <a title="Mission Statement" href="http://opensiddur.org/development/mission/">mission statement</a>.

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
As an open source and free software project, the Open Siddur would not be possible at all were it not for the in-kind contributions of its volunteer developers, transcribers, translators, commentators, artists, designers, and promoters.

We look forward to acknowledging <em>you</em>. Please join our community and <a href="http://opensiddur.org/contribute/">contribute</a> to the Open Siddur by transcribing or translating texts, researching, providing art and comments, sharing ideas, or if you have technical skills, helping us build the Open Siddur web application. If you would like to support the Open Siddur Project financially, tax free donations can be made via a <a href="http://www.razoo.com/story/theopensiddurproject">donation page</a> sponsored by Center for Jewish Culture and Creativity, a 501(3)c non-profit providing the Open Siddur with fiscal sponsorship.

Aharon Varady, who first <a href="http://aharon.varady.net/omphalos/2002/08/update-2002-08-08">outlined the project in 2002</a>, directs the Open Siddur and administers, curates, and provides light-touch editing for all the content on opensiddur.org. Efraim Feinstein is the lead developer of the effort to create what we hope will be an open source application for folk to craft their own siddur from a database of carefully tagged liturgy and liturgy-related work.

We would like to thank the following organizations and individuals for their early help in publicly launching the project.

We also deeply appreciate the participation and interest of the PresenTense staff in the public launch of Open Siddur: Ariel Beery, Aharon Horwitz, Brachie Sprung, Shai Davis, and Brian Blumenthal. Their skill building advice, ideas, and ability to connect us with helpful collaborators was extremely useful and made for a productive summer. We would also like to thank the advice and support provided at that time by J.T. Waldman and Avi Warshavsky (Director of Israel's Center for Educational Technology Department of Humanities).
