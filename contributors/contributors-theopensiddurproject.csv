His father, Kaylil, was the brother of Rabbah bar Naḥmani, a teacher at the Yeshiva (Rabbinic Academy) of Pumbedita. Abayyé's real name was Naḥmani, after his grandfather. Left an orphan at an early age, he was adopted by his uncle, Rabbah bar Naḥmani, who nicknamed him Abayyé (""Little Father""), to avoid confusion (perhaps out of respect for his father) with his grandfather of the same name; thenceforth he was known as Abayyé, without any other title. It is a curious fact that he perpetuated the memory of his foster-mother by mentioning her name in many popular recipes and dietetic precepts. He introduced each recipe with the phrase, ""My mother told me."" Abayyé's teachers were his uncle Rabbah and Yosef bar Ḥama, both of whom successively became presidents of the Pumbedita Academy. When Yosef died (324 CE), this honor was conferred upon Abayyé, who retained it until his death some five years later. Rabbah trained him in the application of the dialectic method to halakhic problems, and Yosef, with his stores of traditional lore, taught him to appreciate the value of positive knowledge.

He was a key figure in the mobilization of American support for the founding of the State of Israel. In 1917, at age twenty-four, he became rabbi of The Temple in Cleveland, Ohio, one of the nation's largest and best-known Reform congregations, where he served for forty-six years. Abba Hillel Silver was an early champion of rights for labor, for worker's compensation and civil liberties, though his highest priorities were to advance respect for and support of Zionism. Silver was a keynote speaker in the Allied Jewish Campaign to raise funds jointly for Zionist projects in Palestine and for European Jewry.

Born in Sulchat, Crimea, he took a prominent part in the regeneration of Karaite Judaism by the help of philosophical elements borrowed from Rabbanite literature. When only nineteen years of age he had mastered the theological knowledge of his time to such a degree that he was elected the spiritual head of the Karaite community of his native town, and in that capacity he engaged the Rabbanite teachers in a public dispute to determine the correct time for the new moon. He then journeyed through many lands and diligently studied the works of Abraham ibn Ezra, Maimonides, Naḥmanides and Rashi. Being, as he said, eager to arrive at ""the truth without bias and prejudice, and free from partisan spirit,"" he determined to accept the results of his investigation, even if they conflicted with Karaite teachings and traditions. In this spirit of fairness he wrote, in 1294, while following the profession of a physician in Constantinople, the work which established his fame and influence despite his Rabbanite proclivities. This work was the ""Mibhar"" (The Choice), a commentary on the Pentateuch, written in the terse, concise, and often obscure style and after the critical method of Ibn Ezra, and this became to the later generation of Karaite teachers a source of instruction in religious philosophy, in exegesis, and in practical theology, that is, the observance of the Torah.

He was one of the Four Chaplains who gave their lives to save other soldiers during the sinking of the troop transport Dorchester during World War II. Born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1911, Goode was one of four children of Brooklyn rabbi Hyman Goodekowitz.[1] Raised in Washington, D.C., Goode excelled at sports at Eastern High School. He became a rabbi after graduating from the University of Cincinnati and in 1937 Hebrew Union College (HUC). While studying at HUC, he spent summers working as a rabbinic student at the Washington Hebrew Congregation. In 1940, he received his Ph.D from Johns Hopkins University. Goode served as a rabbi in Marion, Indiana, and York, Pennsylvania. In 1941, Goode founded Boy Scout Troop 37 in York as a multi-cultural mixed race troop, the first troop in the U.S. to have scouts earn Catholic, Jewish, and Protestant awards. In that same year, he applied to become a Navy chaplain but was turned down. The following year he was accepted into the Army, with orders to Harvard where he studied at the chaplain's school in preparation for deployment to Europe followed by brief service at an airbase in Goldsboro, North Carolina. In October 1942, he joined the other members of the Four Chaplains and was detailed to embark on the Dorchester a few months later. In late 1942, Goode was transferred to Camp Myles Standish in Taunton, Massachusetts, and attended Chaplains School at Harvard University. There he met fellow chaplains George L. Fox, Clark V. Poling and John P. Washington. In January 1943, the chaplains embarked on board the Dorchester, which was transporting over 900 soldiers to the United Kingdom via Greenland. On February 2, 1943, the German submarine U-223 spotted the convoy on the move and closed with the ships, firing a torpedo which struck the Dorchester shortly after midnight. Hundreds of men packed the decks of the rapidly sinking ship and scrambled for the lifeboats. Several of the lifeboats had been damaged and the four chaplains began to organize frightened soldiers. They distributed life jackets from a locker; when the supply of life jackets ran out, each of the chaplains gave his to other soldiers. When the last lifeboats were away, the chaplains prayed with those unable to escape the sinking ship. 27 minutes after the torpedo struck, the Dorchester disappeared below the waves with 672 men still aboard. The last anyone saw of the four chaplains, they were standing on the deck, arms linked and praying together. The four chaplains were all awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and the Purple Heart and received national acclaim for their courage and self-sacrifice. A chapel in their honor was dedicated on February 3, 1951, by President Harry S. Truman at Grace Baptist Church of Philadelphia. The Four Chaplains' Medal was established by act of Congress on July 14, 1960, and was presented posthumously to their next of kin by Secretary of the Army Wilber M. Brucker at Ft. Myer, Virginia, on January 18, 1961. Goode is honored with a feast day along with the other Four Chaplains on the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America on February 3.

Sheshna; died 875) was a famous Gaon or head of the Jewish Talmud Academy of Sura in the 9th century. He was the author of many Responsa, but his chief work was liturgical. He was the first to arrange a complete liturgy for the synagogue. His Prayer-Book (Siddur Rab Amram or Seder Rav Amram), which took the form of a long responsum to the Jews of Spain, is still extant and was an important influence on most of the current rites in use among the Jews. He was a pupil of Natronai II, Gaon of Sura, and was exceptionally honored with the title of Gaon within the lifetime of his teacher. Upon Natronai's death, about 857, the full title and dignities of the gaonate were conferred upon Amram, and he held them until his death. It is characteristic of Amram's method to avoid extreme rigor; thus he decides that a slave who has embraced Judaism, but desires to postpone the necessary circumcision until he feels strong enough for it, is not to be hurried (ib. iv. 6, 11). He placed himself almost in opposition to the Talmud, when he protested that there is no sense in fasting on account of bad dreams, since the true nature of dreams cannot be known.

In 1830 he became rabbi of the small community of Hegenheim in Upper Alsace; and of Strasbourg in 1833. As he was under thirty, the age prescribed by law, he required a special dispensation to qualify for the office. In Strasbourg, Aron acquired the reputation of an eloquent and inspiring preacher and a zealous communal worker. He assisted in founding the School of Arts and Trades and took active interest in other useful institutions. In 1855 he convened an assembly of the rabbis of the department of the Lower Rhine for the consideration of religious questions. Aron was the author of the catechism used for confirmation as prescribed by the Consistory of Lower Alsace.

Born in Pohrlitz, Moravia, Feiwel began his higher education in Brno, where he founded the Zionist student organization Veritas. In 1893 he studied law at Vienna University and became Herzl's close associate, helping to organize the First Zionist Congress in 1897. He contributed to the central organ of the Zionist Organization, Die Welt, and became its editor-in-chief in 1901. In his articles he emphasized that Zionism cannot content itself with the political and diplomatic activity of its leaders; it must also bring about the renewal of Jewish spiritual and social life in the Diaspora. At the first Conference of Austrian Zionists at Olmuetz (1901), Feiwel introduced a program of Zionist Diaspora activity, arguing that Zionism means not only the Jewish people seeking refuge in Ereẓ Israel, but also preparing itself (in the Diaspora) for its future commonwealth. Diaspora work covered the whole range of Jewish life in the countries of dispersion: political, economic, cultural, and sporting activities. When his program was rejected by the Zionist Executive, Feiwel resigned as editor of Die Welt and, together with Martin Buber, Chaim Weizmann, and others, created the Democratic Fraction as an opposition group at the Fifth Zionist Congress. Together with Martin Buber, Davis Trietsch, and the painter E.M. Lilien, Feiwel founded the *Juedischer Verlag, a publishing house that distributed mainly German translations of Hebrew and Yiddish literature.

In 1903, after the *Kishinev pogrom, Feiwel published Die Judenmassacres in Kischinew under the pseudonym Told. Based on an on-the-spot investigation, this book shocked public opinion. Feiwel had close contacts with Jewish authors in Eastern Europe and became a gifted translator of their works. In the book Junge Harfen (1914) he presented their modern poetry. The Juedischer Almanach (1902), an anthology edited by Feiwel, as well as Lieder des Ghetto (1902, 1920), translations of poems of the Yiddish poet Morris Rosenfeld with drawings by E.M. Lilien, also had considerable literary influence. After World War i (1919), Feiwel's friend Weizmann summoned him to London to become his political and economic adviser. When Keren Hayesod was founded (1920), Feiwel became one of its first directors. In 1933 he settled in Jerusalem.",https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/joszef-patai.jpg

It can explain why courting on the web is the perfect substitute if you're a masculine who may be shy to technique a wonderful female in the nightclub or team.  Initially, permit me to supply you with a clue about how exactly on the web hookup online dating performs.

Nonetheless, if you're the type of guy having his center set up on some lovely Asian elegance however you don't know where to find that added particular somebody, then on-line conversation will not be the best choice for you to try initial.

If you opt to chitchat privately along with her, then I recommend you take a cost-free internet dating programs. These everyday online dating applications fundamentally tinder the blaze in order that she gets to be thinking about you once you chat privately.  These online informal online dating software generally are employed in two approaches - you can conversation privately and you get to give one another gifts.  One of the greatest features of by using these applications to fulfill women is it provides you with the opportunity to familiarize yourself with the other person without actually conference inside a open public place or at a nightclub.

In the end, should you can't discover her via a chat bot, then what will you do?  If you have the opportunity to use these applications to fulfill a girl on the web, it's very best that you simply proceed through them quickly. Probably the most desirable capabilities that these particular internet dating bots supply is because they allow you to discuss pictures and instantly discover men and women you share comparable interests with. The best thing about these alluring interactions is they will take spot discreetly. Which means that unless the lady under consideration discovers relating to your routines, it will remain personal and you can continue making love.  Another great attribute of the informal courting programs is because they also permit you to see each other's account.

In general, D2 shares a particularly non-Judean perspective following the split between the north (Ephraim/Israel) and the south (Judah) after the reign of Solomon, a perspective that was ignored by D1 (and successive authors). D2 thus adds a parallel summary of the Northern Israelean monarchs, and brings in the prophetic narratives of Elijah and Elisha which take place in Northern Israel during the time of the Northern Israelean monarchy. In Deuteronomy, D2 adds hortatory (sermons) to D1’s narrative introduction at the beginning of Deuteronomy (the focus of which is the observation of the commandments and divine justice), and otherwise supplements D1’s work.  D2 also adds some verses to the book of Exodus (sefer Shemot) in Parashat Bo.",

One of David's peculiarities, which he shares with Yemenite Hebrew poets, is the scriptio plena spelling of his name (דויד). David has been rightly characterized as a conservative liturgical poet. This is shown in his technique: he uses the syllabic meter more than the quantitative one (used only in two bakkashot), and sometimes he does not use any meter; he prefers monorhymed compositions to the strophic ones. He does not employ the novelties of Andalusian-Hebrew liturgical poetry; he prefers old paytanic structures and very simple forms. (via his entry in encyclopedia.com)",

He received his early education at the Jewish school of his native city, and subsequently entered the gymnasium there, being one of the first Jews admitted to the institution. As his mother was unable to support him, his stay there was short. Asher then learned the trade of carving and gilding, thereby supporting himself as a journeyman artisan during his travels to various cities of Germany and Austria. On the invitation of a wealthy relative he went to London, where he learned English at a private school—subsequently becoming assistant teacher there—and at the same time assiduously studied philosophy, philology, Hebrew, and modern languages. Later, Asher held various offices in the Jewish congregation and was tutor to the children of the chief rabbi of England. Upon his return to Germany he obtained the degree of doctor of philosophy at the Berlin University. Settling in Leipsic, he soon acquired reputation as an English instructor, having among his pupils many persons of high rank. For seven years he held the post of English master at the Commercial School; and for eight years that of examiner of candidates for higher schools at the university. He was also a member of the Academy for Modern Languages, in Berlin, and official interpreter to the Royal Law Courts of Leipsic. A linguist of the first order, he was engaged in literary work of varied character, and diligently contributed to most of the leading German journals, as well as to the English periodicals the ""Times,"" ""Athenæum,"" ""Academy,"" and ""Jewish Chronicle."" For the last he translated Dr. Döllinger's ""Address on the History of the Jews of Europe."" Asher distinguished himself as an interpreter of the philosophy of Schopenhauer; and as an ardent champion of his own coreligionists, energetically combating antisemitic attacks.

As an adult, he was one of the leaders of American Reform Judaism and a philanthropic leader in his adopted hometown of Cincinnati. As rabbi at the largest Reform congregation in the center of Reform Jewish life, Philipson had tremendous influence both within Cincinnati and in the whole country. He was very active in the Central Conference of American Rabbis and United American Hebrew Council throughout his life. He co-wrote the Union Prayer Book, the central prayer book for Reform Judaism, and presided over the first few of its re-publishings. He was a member of the translation committee for the Jewish Publication Society's 1917 Bible translation into English. In the early 20th Century, Philipson was most famous for his anti-Zionist beliefs. Believing that ""...no man can be a member of two Nationalities"", Philipson used his power to counter what he saw as the exclusionary and zealous acts of Zionists. He used HUC's journal of Reform Judaism, The American Israelite, to further his view that Judaism was a religion exclusively, and thus stateless. Shortly after the First Zionist Congress in Basel, the Union of American Hebrew Congregations held its first convention. With Philipson at their head, they issued a statement in 1897 stating that ""America is our Zion."" (via his article in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Philipson"">Wikipedia</a>)",

E was composed in the mid- to late eighth century BCE, toward the end of the heyday of the northern Ephraimite Kingdom, one of the two kingdoms that occupied Biblical Israel. The Kingdom of Ephraim was the larger and more urban of the two, and had its capital in Samaria, the city after which the Samaritans are named. To its south lay the smaller, but better-known Kingdom of Judah, whose capital city was Jerusalem. It seems likely that E was composed during this period because it marked the first literary flowering in ancient Israel. We know this based on the books of Amos and Hosea, composed at about that time, and from a wealth of inscriptions that we can confidently date to that period. The book of E, so called because it uses Elohim as its exclusive name for the deity of the Pentateuch, is composed of five story cycles focusing on five early Israelite heroes: Avraham, Yaakov, Yosef, Moshe, and Bilaam. The stories of Avraham and Bilaam are placed at the beginning and end of the Elohistic document, respectively, so that the two men can serve as models for how one should fear the remote and awesome God of the Elohistic source. The Yaakov, Yosef, and Moshe cycles, which comprise the bulk of the E narrative, chronicle Israel’s metamorphisis from a family into a people.",https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/amit-gvaryahu.jpg

Rabbi Elazar studied Torah under Rabbi Yosef Sagis and Rabbi Jacob Berab, and is counted with the greatest Rabbis and intellectuals of his time: Shlomo Halevi Alkabetz, Yosef Karo, Moshe Cordovero, Isaac Luria, Israel Najara, etc. In 1588 Rabbi Elazar founded the ""Sukat Shalom"" movement who acted to arouse in Jews the devotion to religion. Rabbi Elazar died in 1600 and was buried in Safed. Rabbi Elazar's Book, the Sefer Ḥaredim (ספר חרדים), printed after his death in 1600, is considered as one of the main books of Jewish deontology. The famous piyyut (liturgical poem) Yedid Nefesh (ידיד נפש) was first published by Rabbi Elazar in Sefer Ḥaredim.  He also wrote a commentary on Tractate Bezah  and Berachot of the Jerusalem Talmud.

He was part of the inner ""Chevraya Kadisha"" (Holy Society) school of the Maggid Rebbe Dov Ber of Mezeritch (second leader of the Hasidic movement), who became the decentralised, third generation leadership after the passing of Rebbe Dov Ber in 1772. Their dissemination to new areas of Eastern Europe led the movement's rapid revivalist expansion. Rebbi Elimelech authored the classic work Noam Elimelech. It developed the Hasidic theory of the Tzaddik into the full doctrine of ""Practical/Popular Tzaddikism"". This shaped the social role of mystical leadership, characteristic of the ""Mainstream Hasidic"" path. As the founder of Hasidism in Poland-Galicia, his influence led numerous leaders and dynasties to emerging from his disciples through the early 19th century. Among them the Chozeh of Lublin, together with the Maggid of Koznitz and Menachem Mendel of Rimanov one of the three ""Fathers of Polish Hasidism"", furthered the spread of Tzaddikism in Poland. Because of this, Rebbi Elimelech is venerated by the ""Mainstream"" path in Hasidism, predominant especially in Poland, who descend from his influence.

June 15], 1869 – May 14, 1940) was an anarchist political activist and writer. She played a pivotal role in the development of anarchist political philosophy in North America and Europe in the first half of the 20th century. Born in Kovno, Russian Empire (now Kaunas, Lithuania) to a Jewish family, Goldman emigrated to the United States in 1885. Attracted to anarchism after the Haymarket affair, Goldman became a writer and a renowned lecturer on anarchist philosophy, women's rights, and social issues, attracting crowds of thousands. She and anarchist writer Alexander Berkman, her lover and lifelong friend, planned to assassinate industrialist and financier Henry Clay Frick as an act of propaganda of the deed. Frick survived the attempt on his life in 1892, and Berkman was sentenced to 22 years in prison. Goldman was imprisoned several times in the years that followed, for ""inciting to riot"" and illegally distributing information about birth control. In 1906, Goldman founded the anarchist journal Mother Earth. In 1917, Goldman and Berkman were sentenced to two years in jail for conspiring to ""induce persons not to register"" for the newly instated draft. After their release from prison, they were arrested—along with 248 others—and deported to Russia. Initially supportive of that country's October Revolution that brought the Bolsheviks to power, Goldman changed her opinion in the wake of the Kronstadt rebellion; she denounced the Soviet Union for its violent repression of independent voices. She left the Soviet Union and in 1923 published a book about her experiences, My Disillusionment in Russia. While living in England, Canada, and France, she wrote an autobiography called Living My Life. It was published in two volumes, in 1931 and 1935. After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, Goldman traveled to Spain to support the anarchist revolution there. She died in Toronto, Canada, on May 14, 1940, aged 70. During her life, Goldman was lionized as a freethinking ""rebel woman"" by admirers, and denounced by detractors as an advocate of politically motivated murder and violent revolution. Her writing and lectures spanned a wide variety of issues, including prisons, atheism, freedom of speech, militarism, capitalism, marriage, free love, and homosexuality. Although she distanced herself from first-wave feminism and its efforts toward women's suffrage, she developed new ways of incorporating gender politics into anarchism. After decades of obscurity, Goldman gained iconic status in the 1970s by a revival of interest in her life, when feminist and anarchist scholars rekindled popular interest.

Her sonnet ""The New Colossus"" (1883), was inscribed and installed in 1903 on a bronze plaque on the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty. Upon the proscriptive May Laws of 1881 Lazarus rose to the defense of Russian-Jewish immigrants in powerful articles contributed to The Century (May, 1882, and February 1883). Lazarus became more interested in her Jewish ancestry after reading the George Eliot novel <em>Daniel Deronda</em>, and as she heard of the Russian pogroms that followed the assassination of Tsar Alexander II in 1881. As a result of this anti-Semitic violence, thousands of destitute Ashkenazi Jews emigrated from the Russian Pale of Settlement to New York. Lazarus began to advocate on behalf of indigent Jewish refugees. She helped establish the Hebrew Technical Institute in New York to provide vocational training to assist destitute Jewish immigrants to become self-supporting. In 1883, she founded the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Colonization_Association"">Society for the Improvement and Colonization of East European Jews</a>. An important forerunner of the Zionist movement, Lazarus argued for the creation of a Jewish homeland thirteen years before Theodor Herzl began to use the term ""Zionism.""

He freed his slaves in the 1830s, paying one ex-slave as his farm foreman. He publicly criticized slavery and gave free legal representation to some slaves seeking freedom, but he also represented owners of runaway slaves. As District Attorney, he suppressed abolitionists and did not support an immediate end to slavery.

Gottheil eventually became one of the most influential, well-known and controversial Reform Jewish leaders of his time. He was educated in Posen under Rabbi Solomon Plessner, and later continued his studies at the universities of Berlin and Halle (Ph.D.), receiving in the meanwhile his ""hattarat hora'ah"" in the former city from Samuel Holdheim, whose assistant he became (1855). He also studied under Zunz and Moritz Steinschneider. In 1860 he set out from the Berliner Reformgemeinde to labor for Reform Judaism in new fields. In 1860 he received a call from the Reform Jews of Manchester, England; he went there as rabbi for the Manchester Congregation of British Jews and remained for 13 years. During this time he was connected with the faculty of Owens College as a teacher of the German language. Two of his most noteworthy sermons preached in Manchester were on the slavery question, attacking those who had declared the institution to be sanctioned by Mosaic law. Dr. Gottheil was a member of the Synod of Leipsic in 1871, which took a decided stand on the question of Reform. He left Manchester in 1873, having been elected to succeed the Rev. J. K. Gutheim as assistant to Dr. Samuel Adler, the senior rabbi of Temple Emanu-El, New York City. When Adler retired about eighteen months later, Gottheil succeeded him. On taking charge he reorganized the religious school, and assisted in founding a theological school where preliminary training might be imparted to future candidates for the rabbinate. He prepared in 1886 the first Jewish hymn-book printed in America (with music in a separate volume by A. Davis); it contains not only traditional Jewish hymns, but also others of Christian origin, and upon it was based the Union Hymnal, which has since been generally adopted by the Reform congregations in the United States. In 1889 he started the first Sisterhood of Personal Service, a philanthropic organization affiliated with Temple Emanu-El which served as a model for similar institutions elsewhere. Dr. Gottheil was the founder of the Association of Eastern Rabbis, and when it was assimilated with the Central Conference of American Rabbis in 1890, he took an active part in its deliberations. He was one of the founders and the president of the (American) Jewish Publication Society, vice-president of the Federation of American Zionists, chairman of the Revision Committee for the Union Prayer Book, and one of the governors of the Hebrew Union College, in Cincinnati. Dr. Gottheil's sympathies and interests were broadly universalist, as evidenced by his connection with various non-Jewish institutions as well as by many of his sermons and writings. He was one of the founders of the New York State Conference of Religions, assisting in the editing of its ""Book of Common Prayers""; and a founder and for many years vice-president of the Nineteenth Century Club. In 1893 Gottheil was one of the representatives of the Jews at the Parliament of Religions, held in Chicago during the World Columbian Exposition.",https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/isaac-gantwerk-mayer.jpg

Scarcely anything is known of his personal history. He may have been one of the captives taken to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar. He began prophecying about sixteen years after the return of the Jews to Judah (ca. 520 BCE). The work of rebuilding the Temple had been put to a stop after protestations by the Samaritan-Israelites. After having been suspended for eighteen years, the work was resumed through the efforts of Haggai and Zekhariah.

He was a presenter on BBC World News and its ""Focus on Africa"" programme. The Ghanaian President, John Dramani Mahama, mourned Dumor's death, posting on Twitter, ""Our nation has lost one of its finest ambassadors"". Dumor joined BBC World Service radio in 2007, four years after winning the Ghana Journalist of the Year, for the first time. In a statement posted on the BBC website, the television broadcaster's Global News Director Peter Horrocks said Dumor was ""a leading light of African journalism"". In his last post on Facebook, where he has about 107,000 followers, Dumor said he was ""looking forward"" to interviewing a former South Sudan child soldier and musician Emmanuel JAL, in his television programme.  Dumor was born on October 3, 1972 in Accra, Ghana, the Vibe Ghana website states. His grandfather was Philip Gbeho, the composer of the Ghanaian national anthem, it said. The website said Dumor initially studied medicine at the University of Ghana, but eventually graduated with a socialy and psychology degrees. He later attended Harvard University, where he graduated with a master's degree in public administration.   This was a striped line broken in the middle by a globe, with BBC1 in block letters below it. When it appeared, the continuity announcer would say ""This is BBC Television."" while the globe spun. 1964 saw the creation of BBC1 and BBC2 brands, with the distinctive horizontal stripes across the screen. More now than ever, merchandise was being branded with the logo, as more productions were being sold via the BBC's American identity, Lionheart Television. The mirror globe began using a more ornate font in 1972.  From the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, the BBC1 channel logo used several different fonts, but with each change the logo remained blue. At this time, BBC logos were mechanical models filmed by black-and-white cameras.   Colour was added afterwards, electronically, rendering it simple to change the colour as needed. In August 1988, the BBC produced yet another new logo. Since the last one was made, a consumer brand was becoming part of nearly every TV station and corporation at the time. The BBC needed a strong and unified identity, and a change of said identity was key. Michael Peters was hired to design this all inclusive BBC identity for the corporation. They modified the then-current logo by sharpening up the parallelogram edges again and set them to an angle of 17 degrees without reducing the size of the spaces between the boxes.     They also sharpened up the text to make it match the clarity of the logo itself. The typeface used was Helvetica Neue. Also, under-logo lines were added to the logo for the first time. These lines were coloured blue, red, green to reflect the flags of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland respectively (an ""English-bias"" has always been a criticism of the BBC), as well as the three phosphors of colour television. What he noticed, was that the BBC had a system that meant that every service or department had a different logo scheme. It had a BBC logo and the name with character.   Lambie-Nairn decided to address this when he took on the project, as with all these logos, the core brand itself was severely weakened. It was also appropriate to look at the way the BBC was branded, as the BBC was about to take off in digital television and the internet, among other different ventures. After seeing a number of problems with the then-current logo, he decided that a new logo was necessary. The logo was technically unsuitable on-screen. When shrunk, it lost the lines underneath and the counters and also, when in colour on a colour photo, it again disappeared or parts vanished.    Technically, the logo never looked comfortable next to the brand and straight letters. Finally, it was expensive to print as stationery would always have four-colour letterheads, and alongside other BBC brands could mean anything up to ten-colour letterheads and stationery. By straightening up the boxes and letters, it removed all the problems associated with diagonals and those associated with disappearing lines. This kept the boxes' shape, so that it would still be familiar with what people know about the BBC. The typeface used is Gill Sans, made by Eric Gill. It was chosen because, it was elegant, robust and has a timeless appeal: the typeface had been created 60 years before and so avoided the typeface looking outdated at a later date.   This typeface also eliminated the disappearing counters issue, as the counters of the B's were much larger. Appropriately, some of Gill's statues adorn the exterior of Broadcasting House. Lambie-Nairn's solution is the BBC logo that has been used on-screen since 4 October 1997. The current central logo of the BBC is still the BBC Blocks. It is the longest-used logo by the BBC, and as of 4 October 2018, it has been in use for 21 years. Shortly after receiving its first Royal Charter in 1927, the BBC was granted its own armorials by the College of Arms. The British lion forms the 'crest' of the arms, and the thunderbolt it holds is a heraldic way of representing broadcasting. The eagles form the 'supporters', and represent speed, while the bugles they wear round their necks symbolise public proclamation. On the shield is the globe surrounded by seven stars, which represent the other seven planets in the Solar System and hence reflect the scope and breadth of the Corporation.   The following entry is a record in the ""Catalogue of Catastrophe"" - a list of failed or troubled projects from around the world. Having started operations in 1922, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is one of the world’s oldest and most respected media production and broadcasting organizations.  Covering both entertainment and news, the BBC’s radio and television productions captured the 20th century as it unfolded. The BBC’s archive of broadcast materials is unparalleled and as production continues to this day, the corporation has one of the largest archives of media materials in the world. Delivering content through television, radio, the Internet and via the BBC iPlayer app, the BBC is a brand name that is known around the world. As work proceeded still further problems were encountered.   Internally there was growing concern at the lower levels of project that senior levels were not being given a true picture of what was happening in the project. Bypassing the hierarchy, one senior technologist eventually wrote a letter to the BBC Trust (the committee with governance and oversight responsibility for the BBC) telling them that they were not being given an accurate picture of the project’s true status. According to reports the letter stated that the BBC Trust, the government and other senior parties involved ""may have been misled about the true performance of the DMI since it was taken in house"".   UPDATED: 19 Dec 2013 - An independent report carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (""PwC"") has now been published (BBC Digital Media Initiative Review of the BBC’s management of DMI). Underestimation of complexity. Ineffective governance structure. Hierarchical organization structure in which accurate flows of information were actively blocked (see ""Green Shifting"").  Failure to conduct an effective tendering process when selecting the original supplier. Lack of contractor oversight. Overstating the benefits of the project. The use of a fixed price contract acted as a barrier that discouraged the BBC from getting too deeply involved in the design stages for fear of triggering change requests thereby nullifying the fixed price.    Cedric Messina persuaded the British Broadcasting Corporation to take on the task of filming the whole canon of William Shakespeare's plays for television, under the title The Complete Dramatic Works of William Shakespeare. Throughout the project, which was finished in 1985, the BBC was able to secure leading actors of stage and screen and also big directing names. Whether as individual dramas or taken as a whole, the series is impressive, to say the least. The play Edward III was not included in the series, as the balance of scholarly opinion at the time was that it was not by Shakespeare. Today, the decision might have gone the other way. All of these productions of the plays have been sold to dozens of countries around the world and are used in the world of education more than they are for broadcasting. The major plays (such as Macbeth andHamlet) are the most often repeated on television. The productions vary in length from 112 minutes for The Comedy of Errors to 228 for King Richard the Third.    The British Broadcasting Corporation is a British public service broadcasting statutory corporation. Its main responsibility is to provide impartial public service broadcasting in the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands, and the Isle of Man. It is the largest broadcaster in the world by number of employees, with about 23,000 staff. The BBC is headquartered at Broadcasting House in London and has major production centres in Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Glasgow, London and Salford Quays and smaller production centres throughout the UK. The BBC is a semi-autonomous public service broadcaster that operates under a Royal Charter and a Licence and Agreement from the Home Secretary.    This is a page about the BBC at Zyra's site. None of this .com nonsense! Another thing about the BBC is that it sets a standard, insisting on producing stuff of a certain quality, and having principles. So, for example, no commercial advertisements on BBC television and radio - the reason for this mainly being to maintain provable impartiality. The BBC broadcasts to the world, not just to Britain, and has also diversified into a great many lines of business. Zyra's website is on affiliate programs with BBC SHOP, with BBC SHOP (UK and Europe) and with BBC SHOP AMERICA and with BBC Canada.

The British Broadcasting Corporation holds the title of the world’s oldest broadcast company, providing services in radio, television, music and more. The broadcast powerhouse has offices worldwide, from London to New York and Mumbai to Johannesburg. Where there’s an office, there are interns - and the next one could be you. The tips, tricks and hashtags of social media could soon find a place on your resume with an internship at BBC Worldwide. In the heart of New York City, breaking news is right under your nose - this internship allows you to learn new, innovative ways to handle news and social media content.  Catch up on breaking news updates, check work emails and then strategize ways to keep the buzz on all forums.   After researching and analyzing data on social media platforms, you’ll get the chance to pitch long-term projects involving the strategies that you’ve brainstormed. Imagine pitching said project to senior executives, including the president of BBC America. ""BBC Campus was a project that included the majority of the digital interns. We had web designers, editorial, digital and research interns working together to come up with the blueprint."" - Mia Simon, Former Digital Summer Associate. You’ll learn to master the ins-and-outs of the digital age and emerging media, and become a savvy, digital media extraordinaire, if you will.  You’ll also gain the research skills to pitch a long-term project, as well as those oh-so-essential journalism skills. The BBC looks for movers, shakers and innovators.   Have a strong resume (those resume builders really do mean something), put yourself in the right position and believe in yourself. Researching the internship doesn’t hurt, either. Social media savviness and a strong writing background are essential. Be confident in those skills. ""When I first got to New York, I was very insecure about my skillset. Everyone in our office was so talented, so I got very nervous. But, I had to trust that I was hired for a reason. And I ended up learning from my fellow interns. It was so rewarding to be challenged every day."" - Mia Simon, Former Digital Summer Associate. Nothing beats living in the nation’s heartbeat - New York City. Exploring new territory and discovering city gems makes the intern life pretty sweet. Also, networking and New York bagels? To apply, keep an eye on the BBC Worldwide website. A resume, cover letter and references round out the application.   Facebook page referred to recruitment opportunities at Solasta Finance. It also included links to articles about women in the workplace, alongside posts containing aspirational images and motivational messages associated with the business world. It included a link to the website.  Twitter feed @solastafinance contained similar content to ad (b). Instagram feed contained similar content to ad (b). The complainant challenged whether the ads were obviously identifiable as a marketing communication. The British Broadcasting Corporation t/a BBC (BBC) stated Clique was a BBC3 drama which focused on two female university students getting involved with the mysterious company Solasta Finance and examined issues such as sexism, feminism and capitalism.    The advertising materials were not initially explicitly branded as being BBC Three, and were intended to spark intrigue and maximise discussion about Solasta Finance and its ‘Women’s Initiative’, to engender discussion about some of the issues in the series.  The BBC said the unbranded phase of the campaign, when the connection to BBC Three was not made explicit, began on 19 February and lasted for five days. There was then a full ‘reveal’ with overt BBC Three branding and attribution.mediakind.com Before then the website featured a countdown clock (to the reveal date). Once the reveal was made, some posts resurfaced and new ones were created to clarify that Solasta Finance was linked to a TV show.   "". They said the online content complained of was a very small part of a much bigger on-air and off-air marketing campaign for Clique. The campaign included TV trailers and press activity and lasted for six weeks. They added that the BBC received no complaints about any aspect of the Clique marketing campaign via the BBC’s formal complaints system which received, on average, in excess of 200,000 complaints per year. The ASA acknowledged that the ads in social media released at the start of the campaign did not expressly refer to BBC3 or expressly indicate that the ads related to a TV drama.   We understood, however, that the social media accounts linked to the Solasta Finance website (ad a), which in turn linked to the Clique programme page on the BBC website. We considered that ads for Solasta Finance placed after the 'reveal' on 24 February, and which contained BBC branding, would be understood to relate to a BBC TV show. We considered that the ads which appeared before the reveal were likely to be, at first glance, understood to be for a business called Solasta Finance. We also considered that many readers, particularly in the context of social media, were generally familiar with the concept of a 'reveal', where initial posts might be mysterious or deliberately ambiguous.   We noted that some of the content referred in general terms to employment at Solasta Finance, and considered whether they might initially be interpreted by some readers to be offering genuine employment. However, we noted that those posts would also be seen as mysterious and peculiar; for example, the claim ""new internship position available now"" was immediately followed by the claim ""due to unforeseen circumstances"". We considered readers would therefore understand that the ads were not traditional or conventional job ads and that that contributed to the overall impression that the ads were not what they might at first seem. We investigated the ads under CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 2.1 2.1 Marketing communications must be obviously identifiable as such.",https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/judy-gumbo-albert.jpg

After spending time in Europe he became a professor at Bowdoin and, later, at Harvard College. His first major poetry collections were <em>Voices of the Night</em> (1839) and <em>Ballads and Other Poems</em> (1841).  Longfellow retired from teaching in 1854 to focus on his writing, living the remainder of his life in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in a former headquarters of George Washington. His first wife Mary Potter died in 1835 after a miscarriage. His second wife Frances Appleton died in 1861 after sustaining burns when her dress caught fire.

A tireless author, journalist, and polemicist, he published constantly in both the Yiddish and Hebrew presses, offering a bold new vision of contemporary spiritual life grounded in his reading of Hasidic sources. But Zeitlin sought to become an activist as well as a literary figure. He was especially concerned with the situation of the rootless Jewish youth. Throughout his career as a public figure, beginning shortly after World War I, he issued calls for a new organization of Jewish life. In a series of articles published in the 1920s, he sought to form an elite Jewish spiritual fraternity to be called Yavneh, which was the most fully elaborated of his attempts at intentional community.

He was a prominent Levite rabbi and mystic. Isaiah Horovitz was born in Prague around 1565. His first teacher was his father, Avraham ben Shabtai Sheftel Horowitz, a notable scholar and author, and a disciple of Moses Isserles (Rema). Horowitz studied under Meir Lublin and Joshua Falk. He married Chaya, daughter of Abraham Moul, of Vienna, and was a wealthy and active philanthropist, supporting Torah study, especially in Jerusalem. In 1590, in Lublin, he participated in a meeting of the Council of Four Countries, and his signature is on a decree that condemns the purchase of rabbinic positions. In 1602, he was appointed head of Beis Din in Austria, and in 1606 was appointed Rabbi of Frankfurt am Main. In 1614, after serving as rabbi in prominent cities in Europe, he left Frankfurt—following the Fettmilch uprising—and assumed the prestigious position of chief rabbi of Prague. In 1621, after the death of his wife, he moved to Palestine, was appointed rabbi of the Ashkenazic community in Jerusalem, and married Chava, daughter of R. Eleazer. In 1625, he was kidnapped and imprisoned, together with 15 other Jewish rabbis and scholars, by the Pasha (Ibn Faruh) and held for ransom. After 1626, Horowitz moved to Safed, erstwhile home of Kabbalah, and later died in Tiberias on March 24, 1630 (Nissan 11, 5390 on the Hebrew calendar). In his many Kabbalistic, homiletic and halachic works, he stressed the joy in every action, and how one should convert the evil inclination into good, two concepts that influenced Jewish thought through to the eighteenth-century, and greatly influenced the development of the Ḥassidic movement.

He was president of the Brooklyn Board of Rabbis (1938–40), chairman of the *Rabbinical Assembly's Rabbinic Ethics Committee (1945–48) and a judge (dayyan) and member of the Board of Directors of the Jewish Conciliation Board of America. Believing in the need for a uniform prayer book (siddur) with modern English translations, Bosniak published several prayer books that gained wide acceptance in Conservative synagogues. He edited <em>Prayers of Israel</em> (1925, 1937), <em>Likutei Tefilot: Public and Pulpit Prayers</em> (1927) and <em>Anthology of Prayer</em> (1958), prayer books that included English translations of Sabbath and Holiday prayers, English hymns, responsive readings, and instructions related to worship in English. In 1944, he published <em>Interpreting Jewish Life: The Sermons and Addresses of Jacob Bosniak</em>. Upon his retirement in 1949, Bosniak was elected rabbi emeritus and devoted his time to Jewish scholarship, publishing a critical edition of <em>The Commentary of David Kimhi on the Fifth Book of Psalms</em> (1954).",https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NoamSienna_200sq.png

Kohn was born in Newark, New Jersey, and was ordained at the Jewish Theological Seminary (1907). He earned a doctor of Hebrew letters at the Seminary in 1917. After leading the Adath Jeshurun Congregation in Syracuse, New York (1908), Rabbi Kohn served Ansche Chesed Congregation in Manhattan, New York (1911–31). Located on the West Side, his congregation introduced decorum, mixed seating, and a choir. Many a student at the Jewish Theological Seminary would attend these services as part of their rabbinic experience, contrasting Kohn with Mordecai *Kaplan. Among those, whose career in the rabbinate Kohn guided, was Milton *Steinberg. In 1931 he moved to Los Angeles, which was then growing into a Jewish community of substance, to begin at the ripe age of 50 a long career as rabbi of Sinai Temple. Learned and scholarly, Kohn became associated with the newly founded *University of Judaism (1947), where he was dean of the graduate school and professor of theology until his death. He was president of the Alumni Association of the Jewish Theological Seminary, the precursor of the Rabbinical Assembly. He helped edit the Conservative Movement's Festival Prayer Book and was a member of the commission that prepared its <em>Sabbath and Festival Prayerbook</em> in 1946. Kohn wrote <em>Modern Problems of Jewish Parents</em> (1932), and later in his career he wrote <em>Moral Life of Man – Its Philosophical Foundations</em> (1956) and <em>Evolution as Revelation</em> (1963). Kohn also contributed many articles to philosophical journals and to periodicals dealing with Jewish life and thought. In addition to his scholarly interests, he was active in the affairs of the Jewish community, serving on the Overseas Committee of the Jewish Welfare Board in leadership positions during World War i, and in the Rabbinical Assembly, the Los Angeles Zionist District, and the Jewish Community Council and its affiliated organizations. He was a leading voice of Conservative Judaism in Los Angeles when the modern day Los Angeles Jewish community was being formed in the prewar and immediate postwar years.

Since stepping down as Chief Rabbi, in addition to his international travelling and speaking engagements and prolific writing, Sacks has served as the Ingeborg and Ira Rennert Global Distinguished Professor of Judaic Thought at New York University and as the Kressel and Ephrat Family University Professor of Jewish Thought at Yeshiva University.

Sometimes dubbed the 'Jewish Bishop of Stepney' for his social work, he reformed the liturgy, introduced children's services, a mixed voluntary choir (under Bernard Cousins) and an 8' mahogany pulpit, and offered cheap marriage ceremonies. He is said to have chanted the prayers, in Hebrew and English, in a manner akin to Anglican clergy, and with a marked English accent! Although his innovations did not prevent the Chief Rabbis of the period (Dr. Hertz and Sir Israel Brodie) from visiting, traditionalist immigrants rejected the United Synagogue approach, and established Stepney Orthodox Synagogue, afiliated to the Federation of Synagogues. <a href=""https://booth.lse.ac.uk"">Charles Booth</a> had interviewed Stern, and commented, ""Mr. Stern would defy the foreign prejudice and carry and umbrella (on the Sabbath) if he needed one, but not a walking stick ... Mr. Stern preached on the preceding Sabbath on Gladstone's death. The congregation accepted it. In a ḥevra they would have said 'who is this William Ewart Gladstone?' Mr. Stern would like to go further than he is free to do so. He breaks the din [Jewish law] every day (according to the Interviewer) but has to be wary of offending the foreigner. He would abandon the annual cycle (of Sabbath readings from the Pentateuch, presumably in favour of the triennial cycle); use more English in the Service. He objects to Zionism and praying for the restoration of sacrifices ... although thought a little too much of an innovator by one, he is much respected and his energy and devotion are very great. On the whole, he is a good specimen of the Jew, full of his religion and filled with loyal English sympathies."" His obituary in the Times said but for the wisdom, sympathy and unflagging courage of men like Canon Barnett, H.S. Lewis and J.F. Stern, the process of absorbing and digesting that great influx of foreign Jews would have caused a far more serious social upheaval than it in fact did. Marc Michaels in <em>The East London Synagogue: Outpost of Another World</em> (Kulmus 2008) comments that, although unpopular with most first generation immigrants, it paved a way for their descendants, but that anglicisation proved to be the victim of its own success, encouraging greater social mobility and the suburbanisation of the Jewish community.

He died in New York City at the age of 101. Eisenstein was a lover of Hebrew, and established America's first society for the Hebrew language, Shoharei Sfat Ever. He was also the first to translate the Constitution of the United States into Hebrew and Yiddish (New York, 1891). Other early writings of his are Ma'amarei BaMasoret, ib. 1897, and The Classified Psalter (Pesukei dezimra), Hebrew text with a new translation (1899). He also made an attempt to translate and explain a modified text of the Shulchan Aruch. He was known by many colleagues as the Ba'al ha-Otzrot (""Master of the Anthologies"").

The authors briefly consider a variety of factors and are convincing on almost one: the situation of 'spiraling' fees, which I believe arethe core problem with rollovers. We find small, mostly positive, but often insignificant adjustments to delinquencies after the payday advance bans. Finally, the economists wanted to assess whether payday borrowers are as hopelessly optimistic about their future finances as the rest people. While payment arrangements genuinely might seem like a reasonable solution for some, the rates and fees can be high. In the United States, the rates of these plans were formerly restricted for most states with the Uniform Small Loan Laws (USLL),.  He said Clark's experience with payday cash advances is a reminder that the economy is rigged to serve the few. So if you change the mind about your loan, just return the principal within 72 hours and pay nothing more. The Vietnam veteran was finally able to pay off his debt after receiving disability checks in the government but that's after paying a lot more than $60,000 in fees on an original $2,500 loan.  It may be moved out with the shadows and normalized. With Zest - Cash loans, borrowers are paying down principal with every payment, which cuts down on the cost. online payday loans canada loans ' generally given by non-bank entities ' offer you an 'advance' on your salary for a fee.  Backers argue Secure Choice is legally sound, even minus the explicit ERISA safe harbor. Some users may post messages which can be misleading, untrue or offensive. As the fate with the CFPB remains unclear beneath the Trump administration, banks might not offer cheaper payday cash advances anytime soon. Taking out a Lend - Up loan might be considered a good alternative to a conventional payday advance, however it's still a high priced borrowing option. Borrowers happen to be jailed for owing less than $200. Although your bank could eventually determine whenever you funds are available to you. The study assessed the impact of payday lenders in communities which experienced a natural disaster by considering four measures of community welfare: death rates; drug and alcohol treatment rates; foreclosure rates and birth rates.   Although not packaged as loans, overdraft fees serve a similar function as pay day loans for many individuals, which enable it to be much higher priced than payday loans. Instead, these groups operate as middlemen, connecting customers to law-abiding loans from third-party lenders. This loan uses your car or truck as collateral and is also a great approach to get some more money. The Democrat offered some insight about why state legislators haven't tightened regulation in the short-term lenders. Only your lender can provide you with information about your specific loan terms and APR and the implications for non-payment of your loan. What won't change: People that are cash-strapped still is going to be looking for ways to pay for their bills. But between the town and about five other private businesses inside the Dallas area, the quantity of monthly applications held steady inside the 75 to 100 range. But such efforts usually fail inside General Assembly, which annually ignores bills that would cap the interest rate on payday advances at 36 percent.  By last count, only 14 states have banned payday loans as of now. Please begin to see the table below for representative examples of this product, including interest rates (APRs).",

,,,,,,,,,"When I was a very young child, I used to ask my parents, Why am I a Jew? My mother’s response was always the same: Because your mother and father are Jewish. That answer satisfied me until I was six or seven years old but by then my question had multiplied and I needed more information to resolve my confusion. Although I was always kept out of school on the High Holidays (""because it was a shanda for the goyim"") we didn’t go to services or belong to a synagogue, we never went to a seder and Chanukah was an unknown event in our Christmas tree decorated apartment.  I knew about Jewish holidays because my schoolmates celebrated and I heard stories from my friends at camp.  So why didn’t we celebrate?  I knew that Catholic children didn’t do any of those things so what made me different from Catholics?  If we didn’t do, how could I really be Jewish? This confusion followed me through childhood and I was constantly trying to figure it out. 

At some point, my questions morphed into a quest for Jewish education which, unfortunately, collided with my father’s adamant belief that ""Organized religion was the cause for most problems in the world because each religious leader will claim God is on his side in any conflict.""  Therefor a formal Jewish education was out of the question, but I managed to get some minimal exposure because my dad’s best friend owned a Jewish summer camp.  

I began going to camp when I was six years old and continued, for the next thirteen years, the happiest time of my childhood   It was there that I attended Erev Shabbat services for the first time and learned the Sh'ma, the Motzi and Adon Olam.  As far as I knew they were all camp songs, but with different words.  Instead of cheering for color war, we were cheering for God.  Camp was kosher and I learned to say the motzi before every meal but it made me very sad.  There were 2 dogs at camp called Trixie and Mutzi and it seemed so unfair to pray for Mutzi 3 times a day but never even once for Trixie.                    

As an adult, I joined a Reform synagogue & soon discovered that all my activist instincts, demonstrating for civil rights, fighting for organized labor, opposing the war in Viet Nam, etc. reflected basic Jewish values. I progressed through 4 other congregations, becoming more ritually observant with each. I taught myself to read Hebrew, even to leyn Torah, & I devoured History, Theology & Ethics. I became an adult bat mitzvah & ultimately secured an opportunity for formal world class educational advancement with a scholarship to study Ethics in the Graduate School of the Jewish Theological Seminary. 

The more I've learned, the more there is to learn & I feel I'm always engaged in a gigantic game of catch-up. In fact, all my choices in life regarding my career, relationships, & advocacy are rooted in, & nurtured by, Jewish teaching & my identity as a member of the community.",

His major scholarly pursuits were works on the Pharisees (the second temple era sect from which rabbinic Judaism developed) and on the Sifra, the oldest rabbinic commentary on the book of Leviticus. Finkelstein authored a number of books, including <em>Tradition in the Making, Beliefs and Practices of Judaism</em>, <em>Pre-Maccabean Documents in the Passover Haggadah</em>, <em>Introduction to the Treatises Abot and Abot of Rabbi Nathan</em> (1950, in Hebrew with English summary), <em>Abot of Rabbi Nathan</em>, (a three volume series on The Pharisees), and <em>Akiba: Scholar, Saint and Martyr</em>.

The family traced its lineage back to the revered talmudist, halachist, and kabbalist Gaon of Vilna. Ginzberg emulated the Vilna Gaon’s intermingling of ‘academic knowledge’ in Torah studies under the label ‘historical Judaism’. In his book <em>Students, Scholars and Saints</em>, Ginzberg quotes the Vilna Gaon instructing, “Do not regard the views of the Shulchan Aruch as binding if you think that they are not in agreement with those of the Talmud.” Ginzberg first arrived in America in 1899, unsure where he belonged or what he should pursue. Almost immediately, he accepted a position at Hebrew Union College and subsequently wrote articles for the Jewish Encyclopedia. In 1903, he began teaching at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTS) in New York City, where he taught until his death. He died on November 11, 1953, in New York City.

After Mitchell’s death in June 1854 he became proprietor (his middle name appearing as Heyman) and edited it until February 1855 when new proprietor Abraham Benisch succeeded him.

,,,,,,,,," The British Broadcasting Corporation's services and products are used by 98% of the adults in Britain, every week1. Its website, mostly news and weather, is the most popular and highest quality of its kind and its natural history programs are the best. There are no adverts streamed on its TV channels nor on its website. It is a legal requirement to pay for the BBC License Free if you have a TV set, or some other device, that can view BBC TV content.bbc.co.uk It costs nearly £150 per year2.  It doesn't matter if you watch them, you still have to pay. TV detector vans occasionally prowl the streets, correlating those with sets with addresses with licenses. It's a serious business!   The BBC acquired £3.5 billion as a result of the license fee, in 20091. The fee is occasionally hotly contested by users and by other media companies, who obviously see the BBC as being subsidised competition. Although 37% say that the License fee is the wrong way to fund the BBC3, that is still, in a nation of the unhappy, quite a positive endorsement.  But what are the possible alternatives? Scrap the license fee and let the BBC fend for itself through adverts, populist programming and paid-for services. This will damage quality, but will open up the market. Share the license fee so that it is paid to a consortium and spread between media companies who provide similar services, such as Virgin. This provides a form of market fairness.    It will mean that license-paid-for channels will (like the BBC) have to drop adverts (or at least, a portion of them), which may be more painful to some channels than having the BBC as competition. Reinvent the license as PAYG: now that TV is digitized new ways of charging for the BBC have been opened up. Services can be paid for monthly through the TV set and the like, and services can be provided strictly for those who pay for them. This is fairest on the consumer. ""Magazine publishers and radio stations complain about unfair competition for audiences and advertisers. ] Newspapers point out that the presence of a giant free news website makes it hard to charge for online content.   Similar complaints forced ZDF, a German public broadcaster, to prune its website drastically last year. The BBC has reacted to these criticisms and in 2009 surprised many with a declaration that it would cut back on its website, remove a few digital radio stations, and reduce its spending on sport and imported shows1. ""Magazine publishers and radio stations complain about unfair competition for audiences and advertisers. ] Newspapers point out that the presence of a giant free news website makes it hard to charge for online content.bbcgoodfood.com Similar complaints forced ZDF, a German public broadcaster, to prune its website drastically last year.   However, as we shall see later, there are substantial counter-arguments. 98% of the adults in Britain, every week, use some of the services of the BBC1. The five biggest providers of global news are Al-Jazeera (English), France 24, CNN, Russia Today and BBC World. Although of those 5, Al-Jazeera, CNN and Russia Today are all widely known to be biased and selective in their broadcasting. BBC World has been found by analysts to be the most impartial and trustworthy.6. Many worry about the reduced impact of the BBC given the rise of more-entertaining but less-informative news sources available online1, but for now at least, the BBC is still highly influential across the world.     British nationalist analysts consider it to be a great source of the UK's ""soft power"" around the world - meaning that the BBC is engendering positive attitudes towards the UK and the UK's interests around the world. It also does its part in spreading the use of reasonably well-spoken English. The BBC provides a quality service, with world-class news services and many informational programs. Polls have found that the BBC is trusted more than the police and civil servants; which are both in turn more trusted than other journalists in general1. It Works As It Is: It produces quality products in an era of trashy mass media. If it works, don't fix it!   Maintaining a Guaranteed Quality Service. ""There are still some safe havens which we might be able to protect. Some of them are inside the BBC whose public funding gives it some slight protection against commercialisation. In other words, it provides a good service that provides services worldwide; benefiting many who live where there are no other good sources of global news, and even, helping sway the world towards democracy and civility. Even on its home turf, the BBC is a mass educator rather than an entertainer. It is certainly worth having a corporation that fulfils this role, no matter if the License fee is slightly unpopular, and slightly expensive. The BBC Worldwide made £1 billion in 20091 and has invested in cable channels and studios across the world.   It seems that if the BBC continues to hold out as it is, it will of its own accord become commercially viable and no longer need the License. As competence in English continues to increase throughout the world, things can only get better. But it is a matter of time (a decade) and it is not yet ready to shed the License. A National Public Asset: Some argue that the BBC is has the stature of a national library, or a national museum, whose role is tied in with national identify. Nothing compares to the size and organisation of the valued BBC Archive, for example. Although in 2009 a poll found that 47% thought the BBC License fee wasn't good value3, 98% of all Britons use the BBC, per week1.   I suspect that many view its programs and services without always acknowledging the BBC as the source. No-one else produces wildlife documentaries of the same quality, for example, and its radio stations are taken for granted. In 2009, the BBC voluntarily cut back on some services such as sports, which are more appropriate to the mass-market than to a news provider1. The Guardian. UK newspaper.

Partly due to technological advances made during the First World War, radio became not only a means of receiving information, but also a medium for mass entertainment. In Britain, the Post Office controlled the use of radio under the 1904 Wireless Telegraphy Act, granting licenses to firms under the act. Some commercial firms that wished to exploit this new medium formed the British Broadcasting Company and obtained a licence from the Post Office. After results from the Sykes Committee report in 1923 and the Crawford Committee report in 1925, the government bought the company's shares and transformed it into a public corporation - the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).   The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) introduced the first television service on 2 November 1936. It was limited to the London area and the south east of England. Although only a few people could afford television sets, the technology and service was made available. However, the service was suspended in September 1939 due to the outbreak of the Second World War. Television service did not resume until 7 June 1946. During the late 1940s and early 1950s there was a great deal of debate over the future of broadcasting. This culminated in a White Paper that proposed breaking up the BBC television broadcasting monopoly.   The Television Act of 1954 introduced competition using a new Independent Television Authority (ITA) to manage commercial television, while the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) continued to be funded by a license fee. The BBC, however, continued to attract plaudits. As a result, the Corporation was awarded a second television channel in 1962 on the recommendation of the Pilkington Committee. In the 1960s, a number of 'pirate' radio stations (such as Radio Caroline) began operating illegally, catering for an audience the BBC radio monopoly had failed to reach. A fourth channel (Channel 4) wasn't added until the 1980s. In the 1990s and up to the present day there has been an explosion in the range of broadcasting available through the use of satellite, cable, and internet technology.

Why For So Much of its History was British broadcasting organised as a public service? By way of introduction, it is important that I explain about the British Broadcasting Corporation, known otherwise as the BBC, in order to get a better insight to what I will be explaining further on.   Being the first and the Worlds biggest broadcasting organisation, it has been known to be a public service broadcaster, which has been up and running since 1922, providing services on the internet, TV and radio. I should highlight the fact that when we talk about a ""public service"", we mean services which have been provided to us via the government. Though according to Ofcom, (Office of Communications) a problem lies when we define this term, as it has 4 meanings attached to it. Firstly, let me shed light on the word broadcasting. Broadcasting is the transmitting of programmes to be heard simultaneously by an indefinitely large number of people-is a social invention, not a technical one.   The BBC was to be financed by both tariffs and a licence fee, which after some time proved to be unsuccessful for the rapid expansion of the station. Listeners were building their personal sets with low-priced foreign components, and applying for new licenses. The BBC was not in favour of this and manufacturers were irritated that the production was not proving to be as cost-effective as it should have been. As a result of this, the Sykes Committee was established to help out. There were certain reasons to why the BBC was regulated, which we can consider.   One of which, was that there was limited space on the frequency spectrum, which therefore meant that no organisations could appear freely without any government rule, so to limit this, the government had to step in. In other words, there were technological constraints. It was not technically possible to have numerous amounts of signals altogether, which could ultimately cause blockages. Further more, the Post Office were forcing all the electrical manufacturers to create a single system as it was finding it very difficult to control the private broadcaster who were transmitting messages freely without obtaining a licence from them. Following on, we can also take the example of USA into account.   The way in which the model of organisation was in USA was not accepted by Britain, as the Politicians thought it was inappropriate and were not fond of what they saw, and moved to other models. The way in which the BBC is funded needs to be examined as well. It is through the licence fee, under the Wireless Telegraphy Act, that enables the BBC to act in the public interest. This fee is paid by households and is undoubtedly a reason to why the BBC is a public service, as the public are paying and therefore the BBC should be publicly responsible.",

The league played a critical role in negotiating a compromise after Gandhi was arrested in 1932 and began a hunger strike in protest of British authorities' decision to award the Dalits (the ""untouchable"" castes) separate electoral representation. Meyer David also addressed Dalit social welfare--considered by Gandhi to be critical in his vision of an independent India--in other contexts. In 1932, David proposed a scheme to start a scholarship fund for Dalit students. He envisioned that higher-caste Hindus would financially support Dalit students; the amount of 500 rupees could cover the higher education of one Dalit student for five years, while half of that could cover high-school education. The idea won Gandhi's approval in addition to that of the All-India Depressed Classes Association, which represented Dalits.

,,,,,,,,,"Milton Steinberg (November 25, 1903 – March 20, 1950) was an American rabbi, philosopher, theologian and author. Born in Rochester, New York, he was raised with the combination of his grandparents' traditional Jewish piety and his father's modernist socialism. He graduated as valedictorian of his class at DeWitt Clinton High School and then majored in Classics at City College of New York which he graduated from summa cum laude in 1924. Steinberg received his doctorate in philosophy from Columbia University in 1928 and then entered the Jewish Theological Seminary of America where he was ordained. In seminary, he was strongly influenced by Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan (1881–1983), the founder of Reconstructionist Judaism. After five years in a pulpit in Indiana, he was invited by the Seminary to assume the pulpit of Manhattan's Park Avenue Synagogue, then a small congregation with a Reform orientation. In his sixteen years at the congregation, he grew it from 120 to 750 families. In 1943 he had a near fatal heart attack. While a disciple of Kaplan who considered himself a Reconstructionist, Steinberg was critical of Kaplan's dismissal of metaphysics. Steinberg's works included <em>Basic Judaism</em>, <em>The Making of the Modern Jew</em>, <em>A Partisan Guide to the Jewish Problem</em>, and <em>As A Driven Leaf</em>, a historical novel revolving around the talmudic characters Elisha ben Abuyah and Rabbi Akiva. In his final years, he began writing a series of theological essays. This project, which he had hoped would conclude in a book of theology, was cut short by his death at age 46. An unfinished second novel, <em>The Prophet's Wife</em>, about the Tanakh characters Hosea and Gomer, was published in March 2010.

In 1866, a number of his English translations of Fanny Neuda's teḥinot in German (from her <em>Stunden Der Andacht</em>, 1855/1858) were published in a volume he titled <em>Hours of Devotion</em>.

He was born in Córdoba (present-day Spain), Almoravid Empire on Passover Eve, 1138, and died in Egypt on December 12, 1204. 

Although his writings on Jewish law and ethics were met with acclaim and gratitude from most Jews, even as far off as Iraq and Yemen, and he rose to be the revered head of the Jewish community in Egypt, there were also vociferous critics of some of his writings, particularly in Spain. Nevertheless, he was posthumously acknowledged to be one of the foremost rabbinical arbiters and philosophers in Jewish history, his copious work comprising a cornerstone of Jewish scholarship. His fourteen-volume Mishneh Torah still carries significant canonical authority as a codification of Talmudic law. In the Yeshiva world he is called sometimes ""haNesher haGadol"" (the great eagle) in recognition of his outstanding status as a bona fide exponent of the Oral Torah.

The organization was also charged with recruiting and training rabbis for military service, as well as providing support materials to these newly commissioned chaplains. The JWB also maintained oversight of Jewish chapel facilities at military installations.

These merged organizations included the YWHA, YMHA, and the National Council of Young Men's Hebrew and Kindred Association. In 1941, in a response to a mandate from President Franklin D.

,,,,,,,,,"Rebbi Neḥunyah ben HaQanah (נחוניה בן הקנה‎‎) was a tanna of the 1st and 2nd centuries CE.  He was the teacher of Rebbi Yishmael ben Elisha. Neḥunya is considered to have been a chief transmitter of an esoteric Jewish lineage in antiquity, the Yordei Merqavah (Descenders to the Chariot). Neḥunyah was wealthy and had a large retinue of servants; but he was distinguished for his meekness and forgiving nature, to which he attributed his attainment of great age (Megillah 28a); two short prayers composed by him exhibit the same qualities (Yerushalmi Berakhot 4b). To him is attributed the daily prayer beginning אנא בכח, the initials of which form the forty-two-lettered name of God. He is also supposed by some to have been the author of the early qabbalistic work, the Bahir, and of the Sefer ha-Peli'ah.
<p />
According to the statement of his contemporary, Rebbi Yoḥanan (Shevu'ot 26a), Neḥunya interpreted the entire Torah by the hermeneutic rule known as the ""general and particular"" (""kelal u-feraṭ""), which rule has also been adopted by his pupil Rebbi Yishmael as the eight of his 13 hermeneutic rules. Neḥunya is frequently mentioned in the Talmud; in Ḥullin 129b he is referred to as the antagonist of Eliezer and Joshua in regard to a halakhah (comp., however, Eduyot vi. 2). He said that the Pharaoh of the Exodus was rescued from the Red Sea, that he repented, that he afterward reigned in Nineveh, and that it was he who in the time of Jonah exhorted the inhabitants of Nineveh to repentance (Pirke De-Rebbi Eliezer §43.). Neḥunya is known also for his ethical saying: ""Whoso receives upon him the yoke of the Torah, from him is removed the yoke of royalty and that of <em>derekh erets</em> (worldly concerns); and whoso throws off the yoke of the Torah, upon him is laid the yoke of royalty and that of <em>derekh erets</em>"" (Pirkei Avot 3:6; Avot of Rebbi Natan recension B, 32.

In the 1950s, Glueck discovered remains of the advanced Nabataean civilization in Jordan. Using irrigation, the Nabataeans were able to grow crops and develop a densely populated civilization in the Negev desert, despite receiving under 6 inches (15 cm) of rainfall a year. Glueck worked with Israeli leaders to build an irrigation system modeled on that of the Nabataeans. He was the author of several books on archaeology, religion, and the intersection of the two.

After studying history of religions and comparative religion at Michigan State University, he moved to Boulder, Colorado to study with the innovative Hasidic master and leader in ecumenical dialogue, Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, founder of the Jewish Renewal movement. In addition to Schachter-Shalomi, he also studied with various Sufi masters and teachers of Buddhism, and counts Father Thomas Keating, Trappist monk and founder of the Centering Prayer movement, as an important influence. In 2004, he and Schachter-Shalomi co-founded the Sufi-Hasidic, Inayati-Maimuni Order, fusing the Sufi and Hasidic principles of spirituality and practice espoused by Rabbi Avraham Maimuni in 13th-century Egypt with the teachings of the Ba’al Shem Tov and Hazrat Inayat Khan. Currently, he teaches in the Department of Religious Studies at Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado.

As a writer on religious subjects, he is known for his critically acclaimed commentaries on Hasidic spirituality (written with Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi), A Heart Afire: Stories and Teachings of the Early Hasidic Masters (2009) and A Hidden Light: Stories and Teachings of Early HaBaD and Bratzlav Hasidism (2011). He is also the editor several ecumenical works, including The Common Heart: An Experience of Interreligious Dialogue (2006) and Meditations for InterSpiritual Practice (2011).

As an artist, Miles-Yépez is mostly known for his vibrant paintings, influenced by traditional religious imagery and his Mexican-American heritage. His work in general represents a lifelong fascination with religious iconography, myth and symbol, image and archetype, cultural impressions and his own ancestry. Most of his work is concerned with the acculturation and use of traditional symbols and iconic forms in a new multi-cultural paradigm.",

A civil engineer by trade, Arthur Davis became religiously observant and mastered the Hebrew language, becoming an accomplished Hebraist noted for his study of cantillation marks in the Tanakh. The family moved to Kilburn, London when Nina was six weeks old, later settling in Bayswater. There, Davis gave his daughters an intensive scholarly education in Hebrew and Jewish studies, teaching them himself each morning before breakfast from the age of four, and taking them regularly to the synagogue. The Davises moved in learned Jewish circles, and friends of Nina's parents included the families of Nathan Adler, Simeon Singer, Claude Montefiore, Solomon Schechter, Herbert Bentwich, and Elkan Adler. Arthur Davis was one of the ""Kilburn Wanderers""—a group of Anglo-Jewish intellectuals that formed around Solomon Schechter in the 1880s—members of which took an interest in Nina's work and helped her find publication for her writings.",

,,,,,,,,,"'P,' also known as the ""Priestly"" source, is one of the primary sources of the Masoretic text of the Torah in the Hebrew Bible. According to the Supplementary hypothesis presented by Dr. Tzemaḥ Yoreh, 'P' supplements the earlier 'J' narrative with dates, names, and numbers, ""thus 'ordering' and authenticating 'J's account."" This strata dates from the exilic and early post-exilic period, 571–486 BCE.  'P' is the Pentateuchal (and, to a lesser extent, the Prophetical) source most concerned with the priests, the temple, the regulation of sacrifices (e.g. what to bring on which day), and organization in general, including censuses, the division of labor among the various clans of Levites, and the hierarchy among the tribes. 'P' is responsible for the first of the two creation stories in Genesis (a/k/a Genesis 1), for the genealogies of Adam and Shem, the covenants with Noaḥ and Avraham, and a few other stories concerning Avraham, Yitsḥak and Yaakov. Aside from these, the bulk of 'P's texts are found at the end of Exodus (specifically Exodus 25–40), throughout Leviticus, in Numbers 1–10, and in Joshua 13–21. An important feature of 'P' is their copious addition of lists to the text. Many of these lists are genealogies (e.g. Gen. 5, 11, 36), but they can also be lists of stations on Israel’s journey throughout the wilderness (e.g. Num. 33), cities (e.g. Josh. 14–21), and censuses (e.g. Num. 1–3). By inundating the reader with lists, 'P' attempts to enhance the authority of the Bible, ensuring that their version of events is accepted over possible alternatives. 'P' was a hands-off redactor, preferring to make their additions at the beginnings and ends of narratives. Note that their creation list and genealogical lists appear entirely before and after the earlier account of creation and expulsion from Eden, respectively. Both additions alter our understanding of the surrounded material in important ways without being invasive. Only when the matter at hand is of grave importance to 'P,' as in the case of the pillaging of the innocent inhabitants of Shechem, does 'P' delve fully into the text.",

,,,,,,,,,"Roland B. Gittelsohn (May 13, 1910 to December 13, 1995) was an American Reform Rabbi, community leader, and outspoken voice of conscience. Born in Cleveland, Ohio, he received a B.A. in 1931 from Western Reserve University and a B.H. from Hebrew Union College in 1934. He was ordained at Hebrew Union College in 1936. Gittelsohn then undertook graduate studies at the Teachers’ College, Columbia University and New School in New York. He initially served at the Central Synagogue of Nassau County, N.Y. from 1936-1953. During WWII, Gittelsohn was a chaplain with the 5th Marine Division, participating in the Iwo Jima invasion. His dedication of the cemetery and memorial for Iwo Jima was widely publicized, mainly because of a controversy over having a rabbi say a prayer at the graves of non-Jews. This address is perhaps one of his most famous legacies. He was also awarded three ribbons for his service at Iwo Jima. After the war, Gittelsohn served on President Truman’s Committee on Civil Rights in 1947. During the McCarthy and House on Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) era, Gittelsohn publicly denounced the steady erosion of civil liberties in America. In 1954, Gittelsohn moved to Temple Israel in Boston, where he would remain for the rest of his career, serving as president of the Massachusetts Board of Rabbis from 1958-1960 and president of the Jewish Community Council of Metropolitan Boston 1961-1963. Meanwhile, He served in the Governor’s Commission to Survey Massachusetts Courts in 1955, Massachusetts Commission on Abolition of the Death Penalty 1957-1958, the Governor’s Committee on Migratory Labor 1960-1962 and the Governor’s Committee to Survey Operation of Massachusetts Prisons 1961-1962. From its outset, Gittelsohn condemned the Vietnam War. 

Gittelsohn received two honorary degrees in 1961, the first being a D.D. from Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion and the other a Sc.D. from Lowell Technological Institute (now Lowell University). He became president of the Central Conference of American Rabbis (CCAR) 1969-1971, founding president of the Association of Reform Zionists of America (ARZA) 1977-1984 and the founding president of the World Zionist Executive &amp; Jewish Agency Board of Governors 1978-1984. Gittelsohn was also extremely active in the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (UAHC). He was on its Board of Trustees and was the Vice Chairman 1973-1977, was an honorary life member and the Chairman of the Commission on Jewish Education 1959-1968. Gittelsohn received two awards from the UAHC, the Eisendrath Award in 1983 and the Jay Kaufman Award in 1984.

His mother, two brothers and two sisters perished in the camps. He studied at a Hasidic yeshiva until 1944, when the Germans occupied Hungary and deported tens of thousands of Jews to Auschwitz. He managed to slip back into Czechoslovakia and joined up with a partisan brigade battling the retreating Germans. With the German defeat, Mr. Cohn rejoined his father and two sisters in Pressburg. After the war, Mr. Cohn made his way to the United States and became wealthy developing thousands of single-family homes on Staten Island. He also turned himself into an expert mohel, performing thousands of circumcisions and writing scholarly articles. He even set up an operating theater in his Staten Island home to circumcise adult Russian Jews who had not been able to undergo the ritual as infants because of Soviet strictures.

Her father, Ya‘akov ben Me’ir Horovitz (1680–1755), was the rabbi of Bolechów and later of Brody, where he was also a member of the elite kloyz (circle) of scholar-mystics. Three of Leah’s five brothers also functioned as rabbis. While living as a young married woman in her brother’s household in Bolechów—he had succeeded his father as rabbi—Leah gained a considerable and an unusual, for a woman, reputation as a learned scholar among her contemporaries. The memoirist Ber Birkenthal (Ber of Bolechów) recounted how Horovitz regularly helped him with difficult Talmudic problems as he awaited his lessons with her brother. Leah was married twice, first to Aryeh Leib, son of the rabbi of Dobromil, and then to Shabetai ben Binyamin Rapoport, the rabbi of Krasny.

Sore bas Toyvim, fl. late 17th/early 18th century), daughter of Mordecai (or daughter of Isaac or Jacob, as sometimes listed on the title pages of various editions of her works), of Satanov in Podolia, in present-day Ukraine, great-granddaughter of Rabbi Mordecai of Brisk (on this, all editions agree), became the emblematic tkhine [q.v.] author, and one of her works, Shloyshe sheorim, perhaps the most beloved of all tkhines. An elusive figure, in the course of time she took on legendary proportions; indeed, some have insisted that she never existed. The fact that the name of her father (although not her great-grandfather) changes from edition to edition of her work, and the unusual circumstance that no edition mentions a husband, make it difficult to document her life. In fact, the skepticism about Sarah’s existence is rooted in the older scholarly view that no tkhines were written by women authors, and that all of them were maskilic fabrications. Since a number of women authors have now been historically authenticated, there seems no reason to doubt that there was a woman, probably known as Sore bas Toyvim who composed most or all of the two eighteenth-century texts attributed to her. Rather unusually for the genre of tkhines, her works contain a strong autobiographical element: She refers to herself as “I, the renowned woman Sore bas toyvim, of distinguished ancestry” and tells the story of her fall from a wealthy youth to an old age of poverty and wandering, a fall she attributes to the sin of talking in synagogue.

,,,,,,,,,"The Septuagint (from the Latin: septuaginta, lit. 'seventy'; often abbreviated 70; in Roman numerals, LXX), is the earliest extant Koine Greek translation of books from the Hebrew Bible, various biblical apocrypha, and deuterocanonical books. The first five books of the Hebrew Bible, known as the Torah or the Pentateuch, were translated in the mid-3rd century BCE; they did not survive as original-translation texts, however, except as rare fragments. The remaining books of the Septuagint are presumably translations of the 2nd century BCE. The full title (Ancient Greek: Ἡ μετάφρασις τῶν Ἑβδομήκοντα, lit. 'The Translation of the Seventy') derives from the story recorded in the Letter of Aristeas that the Torah was translated into Greek at the request of Ptolemy II Philadelphus (285–247 BCE) by 70 Jewish scholars or, according to later tradition, 72: six scholars from each of the Twelve Tribes of Israel, who independently produced identical translations. The miraculous character of the Aristeas legend might indicate the esteem and disdain in which the translation was held at the time; Greek translations of Hebrew scriptures were in circulation among the Alexandrian Jews. Egyptian papyri from the period have led most scholars to view as probable Aristeas's dating of the translation of the Pentateuch to the third century BCE. Whatever share the Ptolemaic court may have had in the translation, it satisfied a need felt by the Jewish community (in whom the knowledge of Hebrew was waning).",

Alkabetz studied Torah under Rabbi Yosef Taitatzak. In 1529, he married the daughter of Yitzhak Cohen, a wealthy householder living in Salonica. Alkabetz gave his father-in-law a copy of his newly completed work <em>Manot ha-Levi</em>. He settled in Adrianople where he wrote <em>Beit Hashem</em>, <em>Avotot Ahava</em>, <em>Ayelet Ahavim</em> and <em>Brit HaLevi</em>. This latter work he dedicated to his admirers in Adrianople. His students included Rabbi Shmuel Ozida, author of <em>Midrash Shmuel</em> on Avot, and Rabbi Avraham Galante, author of <em>Yareach Yakar</em> on Zohar. His circle included Moshe Alsheich and Yosef Karo, as well as his famous brother-in-law Moshe Cordovero. Following the Tiqūn Leil Shavuot, Rabbi Shlomo and Rabbi Joseph Karo stayed awake all that night learning and during the recitation of the required texts, Rabbi Karo had a mystical experience: The Shekhinah appeared as a maggid, praising the circle and telling them to move to the Land of Israel. When they stayed up again the second night of Shavuot, the Shekhinah was adamant about their moving to the land of Israel. The account was recorded by Al-Qabets. He settled in Safed in 1535. His works written in Adrianople center on the holiness of the people Israel, the Land of Israel, and the specialness of the mitsvot. Al-Qabets accepts the tradition that Esther was married to Mordekhai before being taken to the king's palace and becoming queen, and even continued her relationship with Mordekhai after taking up her royal post. The view of midrash articulated by Al-Qabets and other members of the school of Joseph Taitatsak represents an extension of the view of the authority of the oral law and halakhic midrash to aggadic midrash and thus leads to the sanctification and near canonization of aggadic expansions of biblical narrative.",

Unfortunately, little else is known of him. As the piyyut was popular in Afghanistan and is thematically concerned with the archetpal Ushpizin of kabbalistic lore and mystical sukkot custom, we may cautiously assume that Shlomo was a paytan in Afghanistan in the 17th or 18th century, after which the piyyut spread to other communities.",

He was born in Minsk, Belarus, and immigrated to the United States in 1889. He was one of the most prolific and talented of the early Yiddish composers who fashioned a type of Yiddish counterpart to American popular song around the turn of the 19th–20th century and in the immediately ensuing years. He wrote a profusion of songs (words and music) and many lyrics for other songwriters. His subject matter ranged from immigrant families, labor conditions, biblical vignettes, Judaic observances, Jewish historical incidents, nostalgia, immigration obstacles, and current topical subjects to wedding celebration songs. In the last decade of his life—when, to eke out a basic subsistence, he toured the United States and traveled across Canada from Halifax to Calgary and Winnipeg, entertaining local Jewish audiences with his own and similar songs—he mused on man’s course through life in his song Man shpilt teater (Mankind Plays in a Theater): “We act as if we were all on the stage, each one acting out his little life to a script written and directed by Almighty God.” Throughout the first two decades of the 20th century Shmulevitz recorded his songs in many of the earliest recording studios on a regular basis. Thereafter he continued to turn out melodies and lyrics for others to sing. His legacy comprises about 150 known or traceable songs and song lyrics—of which ""A brivele der mamen"" is now unquestionably his most famous—although in a letter to the press he once referred to twice that number with his own tunes, in addition to 200 sets of words to melodies by others.

He was a teacher of halakha, judge, physician, and astronomer. He was born about 165 CE at Nehardea, in Babylonia and died there in 254 CE.

In Talmudic texts, Shmuel is frequently associated with Abba Arikha, with whom he debated on many major issues. He was the teacher of Rabbi Yehudah ben Yeḥezkel. From the little biographical information gleaned from the Talmud, we know that Shmuel was never ordained as a Tanna, that he was very precise with his words (Kiddushin 70a), and that he had a special affinity for astronomy: one of his best known sayings was that ""The paths of heaven are as clear to me as the pathways of Nehardea.""",

Whether he was revising the Septuagint, or was working from Hebrew manuscripts that represented a parallel tradition that has not survived, is debated. His finished version, which filled some lacunae in the Septuagint version of the Book of Jeremiah and Book of Job, formed one column in Origen of Alexandria's Hexapla, c. 240 CE.

Next year he was collated to a prebend at Salisbury, and in 1673 to the archdeaconry of Gloucester, receiving the degree of D.D. shortly afterwards. As librarian, Hyde was responsible for the publication of the Catalogus impressorum Librorum Bibliothecae Bodleianae (1674) [Catalog of the Printed Books in the Bodleian Library], the third published catalogue of the Bodleian collections. In 1691 the death of Edward Pococke opened up to Hyde the Laudian professorship of Arabic; and in 1697, on the deprivation of Roger Altham, he succeeded to the Regius chair of Hebrew and a canonry of Christ Church.",
,,,,,,,,,"Thomas Jefferson (April 13, 1743 – July 4, 1826) was an American statesman, diplomat, lawyer, architect, and Founding Father who served as the third president of the United States from 1801 to 1809. Previously, he had served as the second vice president of the United States from 1797 to 1801. The principal author of the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson was a proponent of democracy, republicanism, and individual rights, motivating American colonists to break from the Kingdom of Great Britain and form a new nation; he produced formative documents and decisions at both the state and national level.

During the American Revolution, he represented Virginia in the Continental Congress that adopted the Declaration, drafted the law for religious freedom as a Virginia legislator, and served as the second Governor of Virginia from 1779 to 1781, during the American Revolutionary War. He became the United States Minister to France in May 1785, and subsequently the nation's first secretary of state under President George Washington from 1790 to 1793. Jefferson and James Madison organized the Democratic-Republican Party to oppose the Federalist Party during the formation of the First Party System. With Madison, he anonymously wrote the controversial Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions in 1798 and 1799, which sought to strengthen states' rights by nullifying the federal Alien and Sedition Acts.

As president, Jefferson pursued the nation's shipping and trade interests against Barbary pirates and aggressive British trade policies. He also organized the Louisiana Purchase, almost doubling the country's territory. As a result of peace negotiations with France, his administration reduced military forces. He was reelected in 1804. Jefferson's second term was beset with difficulties at home, including the trial of former vice president Aaron Burr. American foreign trade was diminished when Jefferson implemented the Embargo Act of 1807, responding to British threats to U.S. shipping. In 1803, Jefferson began a controversial process of Indian tribe removal to the newly organized Louisiana Territory, and he signed the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves in 1807. After retiring from public office, Jefferson founded the University of Virginia.

Jefferson, while primarily a planter, lawyer and politician, mastered many disciplines, which ranged from surveying and mathematics to horticulture and mechanics. He was an architect in the classical tradition. Jefferson's keen interest in religion and philosophy led to his presidency of the American Philosophical Society; he shunned organized religion but was influenced by both Christianity and deism. A philologist, Jefferson knew several languages. He was a prolific letter writer and corresponded with many prominent people. His only full-length book is Notes on the State of Virginia (1785), considered perhaps the most important American book published before 1800.

Although regarded as a leading spokesman for democracy and republicanism in the era of the Enlightenment, Jefferson's historical legacy is mixed. Some modern scholarship has been critical of Jefferson's private life, pointing out the contradiction between his ownership of the large numbers of slaves that worked his plantations and his famous declaration that ""all men are created equal"". Another point of controversy stems from the evidence that after his wife Martha died in 1782, Jefferson fathered children with Martha's half-sister, Sally Hemings, who was his slave. Despite this, presidential scholars and historians generally praise his public achievements, including his advocacy of religious freedom and tolerance in Virginia. Jefferson continues to rank highly among U.S. presidents.",

,,,,,,,,,"Huge crowds and high emotions have marked Nigeria's presidential election campaign -- polling takes place on Saturday   Fifteen people were killed in a stampede at an election campaign rally by President Muhammadu Buhari in southern Nigeria, health officials said Wednesday.    The deaths are the latest on the campaign trail before Saturday's election, at which Buhari is seeking a second, four-year term of office.   Kem-Daniel Elebiga, spokesman for the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital, said ""a total of 15 bodies were brought in"" on Tuesday.    Three were men and the rest women, he added.  Twelve injured people were also brought in, nine of whom remained in hospital Wednesday. ""They are all responding well to treatment,"" said Elebiga.   Police in Rivers state, of which Port Harcourt is the capital, earlier gave a toll of four dead and four injured, while Buhari's office said only that ""several"" people lost their lives.   Conflicting death tolls are not unusual in Nigeria, although the authorities often provide lower numbers.   Local media and eyewitnesses said the stampede happened when panic broke out at the end of a rally held in the city's Adokiye Amiesimaka Stadium.    Crowds tried to force their way through a locked exit.  ""Those from behind were pushing and putting pressure on those in front, leading to some persons falling on the ground and being trampled upon,"" said journalist Egufe Yafugborhi, of the Vanguard newspaper.    - Bloody aftermath -  Blood-stained clothes, discarded shoes, and belongings remained strewn at the site Wednesday.   Eyewitness Catherine Omokiniovo told AFP: ""I was outside the gate selling popcorn when people started coming out.   ""All of a sudden we started hearing cries of those who had fallen and could not get up because they had been trapped. There was confusion everywhere.   ""Over 20 bodies were taken away in ambulances,"" she said, adding one of the victims was a pregnant woman and another a woman whose wedding was just months away.   Other witnesses gave a similar account. ""The police blocked a section of the entrance with their vehicles, preventing free flow of movement after the rally,"" said one.   In Rivers, police spokesman Nnamdi Omoni said an investigation has been opened to determine the cause of the stampede.    ""We are also evolving measures to improve on crowd control at such events,"" he added.  Crowd safety has been a concern at campaign rallies, with fanatical party supporters typically held back by inadequate fencing and ill-equipped security officials.   Last Thursday, two people were reported to have died during a crush at a Buhari rally in the northeastern state of Taraba.   On January 21, several people were injured in the northeastern city of Maiduguri when a platform collapsed during a visit by Buhari.   Rivers, home to the oil and gas industry, is a key battleground in the election between the ruling All Progressives Congress and the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party.   Tensions typically mount between supporters of the two sides before, during, and after elections. Already, there are claims of attempts to rig the vote.   Five APC members were shot and killed Sunday during weekend clashes with PDP followers near the oil city of Warri, in Delta state.",

He conceived of philosophy as total perspective or seeing things <em>sub specie totius</em> (i.e. “from the perspective of the whole”)—a phrase inspired by Spinoza's <em>sub specie aeternitatis</em>, roughly meaning ""from the perspective of the eternal."" He sought to unify and humanize the great body of historical knowledge, which had grown voluminous and become fragmented into esoteric specialties, and to vitalize it for contemporary application. The Durants were awarded the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction in 1968 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1977.",
,,,,,,,,," Komla Dumor, one of Ghana's best-known journalists, has died suddenly in London where he was working for the British Broadcasting Corporation. Dumor, who was 41, died of a heart attack, according to the BBC on Saturday.  He was a presenter on BBC World News and its ""Focus on Africa"" programme. The Ghanaian President, John Dramani Mahama, mourned Dumor's death, posting on Twitter, ""Our nation has lost one of its finest ambassadors"". Dumor joined BBC World Service radio in 2007, four years after winning the Ghana Journalist of the Year, for the first time.livejournal.com In a statement posted on the BBC website, the television broadcaster's Global News Director Peter Horrocks said Dumor was ""a leading light of African journalism"".  In his last post on Facebook, where he has about 107,000 followers, Dumor said he was ""looking forward"" to interviewing a former South Sudan child soldier and musician Emmanuel JAL, in his television programme. Dumor was born on October 3, 1972 in Accra, Ghana, the Vibe Ghana website states. His grandfather was Philip Gbeho, the composer of the Ghanaian national anthem, it said. The website said Dumor initially studied medicine at the University of Ghana, but eventually graduated with a socialy and psychology degrees. He later attended Harvard University, where he graduated with a master's degree in public administration.   This was a striped line broken in the middle by a globe, with BBC1 in block letters below it.applian.com When it appeared, the continuity announcer would say ""This is BBC Television."" while the globe spun. 1964 saw the creation of BBC1 and BBC2 brands, with the distinctive horizontal stripes across the screen. More now than ever, merchandise was being branded with the logo, as more productions were being sold via the BBC's American identity, Lionheart Television. The mirror globe began using a more ornate font in 1972. From the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, the BBC1 channel logo used several different fonts, but with each change the logo remained blue. At this time, BBC logos were mechanical models filmed by black-and-white cameras.   Colour was added afterwards, electronically, rendering it simple to change the colour as needed. In August 1988, the BBC produced yet another new logo. Since the last one was made, a consumer brand was becoming part of nearly every TV station and corporation at the time. The BBC needed a strong and unified identity, and a change of said identity was key. Michael Peters was hired to design this all inclusive BBC identity for the corporation. They modified the then-current logo by sharpening up the parallelogram edges again and set them to an angle of 17 degrees without reducing the size of the spaces between the boxes.    They also sharpened up the text to make it match the clarity of the logo itself. The typeface used was Helvetica Neue. Also, under-logo lines were added to the logo for the first time. These lines were coloured blue, red, green to reflect the flags of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland respectively (an ""English-bias"" has always been a criticism of the BBC), as well as the three phosphors of colour television. What he noticed, was that the BBC had a system that meant that every service or department had a different logo scheme. It had a BBC logo and the name with character.   Lambie-Nairn decided to address this when he took on the project, as with all these logos, the core brand itself was severely weakened. It was also appropriate to look at the way the BBC was branded, as the BBC was about to take off in digital television and the internet, among other different ventures. After seeing a number of problems with the then-current logo, he decided that a new logo was necessary. The logo was technically unsuitable on-screen. When shrunk, it lost the lines underneath and the counters and also, when in colour on a colour photo, it again disappeared or parts vanished.    Technically, the logo never looked comfortable next to the brand and straight letters. Finally, it was expensive to print as stationery would always have four-colour letterheads, and alongside other BBC brands could mean anything up to ten-colour letterheads and stationery. By straightening up the boxes and letters, it removed all the problems associated with diagonals and those associated with disappearing lines. This kept the boxes' shape, so that it would still be familiar with what people know about the BBC. The typeface used is Gill Sans, made by Eric Gill. It was chosen because, it was elegant, robust and has a timeless appeal: the typeface had been created 60 years before and so avoided the typeface looking outdated at a later date.   This typeface also eliminated the disappearing counters issue, as the counters of the B's were much larger. Appropriately, some of Gill's statues adorn the exterior of Broadcasting House. Lambie-Nairn's solution is the BBC logo that has been used on-screen since 4 October 1997. The current central logo of the BBC is still the BBC Blocks. It is the longest-used logo by the BBC, and as of 4 October 2018, it has been in use for 21 years. Shortly after receiving its first Royal Charter in 1927, the BBC was granted its own armorials by the College of Arms.  The British lion forms the 'crest' of the arms, and the thunderbolt it holds is a heraldic way of representing broadcasting. The eagles form the 'supporters', and represent speed, while the bugles they wear round their necks symbolise public proclamation. On the shield is the globe surrounded by seven stars, which represent the other seven planets in the Solar System and hence reflect the scope and breadth of the Corporation.   The following entry is a record in the ""Catalogue of Catastrophe"" - a list of failed or troubled projects from around the world. Having started operations in 1922, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is one of the world’s oldest and most respected media production and broadcasting organizations. Covering both entertainment and news, the BBC’s radio and television productions captured the 20th century as it unfolded. The BBC’s archive of broadcast materials is unparalleled and as production continues to this day, the corporation has one of the largest archives of media materials in the world.  Delivering content through television, radio, the Internet and via the BBC iPlayer app, the BBC is a brand name that is known around the world. As work proceeded still further problems were encountered.   Internally there was growing concern at the lower levels of project that senior levels were not being given a true picture of what was happening in the project. Bypassing the hierarchy, one senior technologist eventually wrote a letter to the BBC Trust (the committee with governance and oversight responsibility for the BBC) telling them that they were not being given an accurate picture of the project’s true status. According to reports the letter stated that the BBC Trust, the government and other senior parties involved ""may have been misled about the true performance of the DMI since it was taken in house"".   UPDATED: 19 Dec 2013 - An independent report carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (""PwC"") has now been published (BBC Digital Media Initiative Review of the BBC’s management of DMI). Underestimation of complexity. Ineffective governance structure. Hierarchical organization structure in which accurate flows of information were actively blocked (see ""Green Shifting""). Failure to conduct an effective tendering process when selecting the original supplier. Lack of contractor oversight. Overstating the benefits of the project. The use of a fixed price contract acted as a barrier that discouraged the BBC from getting too deeply involved in the design stages for fear of triggering change requests thereby nullifying the fixed price.     Cedric Messina persuaded the British Broadcasting Corporation to take on the task of filming the whole canon of William Shakespeare's plays for television, under the title The Complete Dramatic Works of William Shakespeare. Throughout the project, which was finished in 1985, the BBC was able to secure leading actors of stage and screen and also big directing names.  Whether as individual dramas or taken as a whole, the series is impressive, to say the least. The play Edward III was not included in the series, as the balance of scholarly opinion at the time was that it was not by Shakespeare. Today, the decision might have gone the other way. All of these productions of the plays have been sold to dozens of countries around the world and are used in the world of education more than they are for broadcasting. The major plays (such as Macbeth andHamlet) are the most often repeated on television. The productions vary in length from 112 minutes for The Comedy of Errors to 228 for King Richard the Third.    The British Broadcasting Corporation is a British public service broadcasting statutory corporation. Its main responsibility is to provide impartial public service broadcasting in the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands, and the Isle of Man. It is the largest broadcaster in the world by number of employees, with about 23,000 staff. The BBC is headquartered at Broadcasting House in London and has major production centres in Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Glasgow, London and Salford Quays and smaller production centres throughout the UK. The BBC is a semi-autonomous public service broadcaster that operates under a Royal Charter and a Licence and Agreement from the Home Secretary.    This is a page about the BBC at Zyra's site. None of this .com nonsense! Another thing about the BBC is that it sets a standard, insisting on producing stuff of a certain quality, and having principles. So, for example, no commercial advertisements on BBC television and radio - the reason for this mainly being to maintain provable impartiality. The BBC broadcasts to the world, not just to Britain, and has also diversified into a great many lines of business. Zyra's website is on affiliate programs with BBC SHOP, with BBC SHOP (UK and Europe) and with BBC SHOP AMERICA and with BBC Canada.

The British Broadcasting Corporation holds the title of the world’s oldest broadcast company, providing services in radio, television, music and more. The broadcast powerhouse has offices worldwide, from London to New York and Mumbai to Johannesburg. Where there’s an office, there are interns - and the next one could be you. The tips, tricks and hashtags of social media could soon find a place on your resume with an internship at BBC Worldwide. In the heart of New York City, breaking news is right under your nose - this internship allows you to learn new, innovative ways to handle news and social media content.  Catch up on breaking news updates, check work emails and then strategize ways to keep the buzz on all forums.   After researching and analyzing data on social media platforms, you’ll get the chance to pitch long-term projects involving the strategies that you’ve brainstormed. Imagine pitching said project to senior executives, including the president of BBC America. ""BBC Campus was a project that included the majority of the digital interns. We had web designers, editorial, digital and research interns working together to come up with the blueprint."" - Mia Simon, Former Digital Summer Associate. You’ll learn to master the ins-and-outs of the digital age and emerging media, and become a savvy, digital media extraordinaire, if you will. You’ll also gain the research skills to pitch a long-term project, as well as those oh-so-essential journalism skills. The BBC looks for movers, shakers and innovators.   Have a strong resume (those resume builders really do mean something), put yourself in the right position and believe in yourself. Researching the internship doesn’t hurt, either. Social media savviness and a strong writing background are essential. Be confident in those skills. ""When I first got to New York, I was very insecure about my skillset. Everyone in our office was so talented, so I got very nervous. But, I had to trust that I was hired for a reason. And I ended up learning from my fellow interns. It was so rewarding to be challenged every day."" - Mia Simon, Former Digital Summer Associate. Nothing beats living in the nation’s heartbeat - New York City. Exploring new territory and discovering city gems makes the intern life pretty sweet. Also, networking and New York bagels? To apply, keep an eye on the BBC Worldwide website. A resume, cover letter and references round out the application.   Facebook page referred to recruitment opportunities at Solasta Finance. It also included links to articles about women in the workplace, alongside posts containing aspirational images and motivational messages associated with the business world. It included a link to the website. Twitter feed @solastafinance contained similar content to ad (b). Instagram feed contained similar content to ad (b). The complainant challenged whether the ads were obviously identifiable as a marketing communication. The British Broadcasting Corporation t/a BBC (BBC) stated Clique was a BBC3 drama which focused on two female university students getting involved with the mysterious company Solasta Finance and examined issues such as sexism, feminism and capitalism.    The advertising materials were not initially explicitly branded as being BBC Three, and were intended to spark intrigue and maximise discussion about Solasta Finance and its ‘Women’s Initiative’, to engender discussion about some of the issues in the series. The BBC said the unbranded phase of the campaign, when the connection to BBC Three was not made explicit, began on 19 February and lasted for five days. There was then a full ‘reveal’ with overt BBC Three branding and attribution. Before then the website featured a countdown clock (to the reveal date). Once the reveal was made, some posts resurfaced and new ones were created to clarify that Solasta Finance was linked to a TV show.   "". They said the online content complained of was a very small part of a much bigger on-air and off-air marketing campaign for Clique. The campaign included TV trailers and press activity and lasted for six weeks. They added that the BBC received no complaints about any aspect of the Clique marketing campaign via the BBC’s formal complaints system which received, on average, in excess of 200,000 complaints per year. The ASA acknowledged that the ads in social media released at the start of the campaign did not expressly refer to BBC3 or expressly indicate that the ads related to a TV drama.   We understood, however, that the social media accounts linked to the Solasta Finance website (ad a), which in turn linked to the Clique programme page on the BBC website. We considered that ads for Solasta Finance placed after the 'reveal' on 24 February, and which contained BBC branding, would be understood to relate to a BBC TV show. We considered that the ads which appeared before the reveal were likely to be, at first glance, understood to be for a business called Solasta Finance. We also considered that many readers, particularly in the context of social media, were generally familiar with the concept of a 'reveal', where initial posts might be mysterious or deliberately ambiguous.   We noted that some of the content referred in general terms to employment at Solasta Finance, and considered whether they might initially be interpreted by some readers to be offering genuine employment. However, we noted that those posts would also be seen as mysterious and peculiar; for example, the claim ""new internship position available now"" was immediately followed by the claim ""due to unforeseen circumstances"". We considered readers would therefore understand that the ads were not traditional or conventional job ads and that that contributed to the overall impression that the ads were not what they might at first seem. We investigated the ads under CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 2.1 2.1 Marketing communications must be obviously identifiable as such.",

,,,,,,,,,"In the past, interiors were assembled instinctively as an element of the process of building.[1]  The profession of interior planning has been a response to the growth of society along with the complex architecture which includes resulted from the creation of industrial processes.    The search for effective utilization of space, user well-being and functional design has contributed to enhancing the contemporary home design profession. The profession of interior planning is separate and distinct in the role of interior decorator, a phrase commonly used from the US; the definition of is less frequent in the UK, the location where the profession of home design is still unregulated and thus, as it happens, not even officially a profession.  In ancient India, architects would also work as interior designers. This can be seen through the references of Vishwakarma the architect—one from the gods in Indian mythology. In these architects' kind of 17th-century Indian homes, sculptures depicting ancient texts and events emerged inside the palaces, while in the medieval times sketches paintings were perhaps the most common feature of palace-like mansions in India popularly known as havelis. While most traditional homes are already demolished to produce way to modern buildings, you will still find around 2000 havelis[2] within the Shekhawati region of Rajashtan that display paintings paintings.  In ancient Egypt, ""soul houses"" (or designs of houses) were positioned in tombs as receptacles for food offerings. From these, it's possible to discern information regarding the home design of different residences through the different Egyptian dynasties, for example changes in ventilation, porticoes, columns, loggias, windows, and doors.[3]  Throughout the 17th and eighteenth century and in to the early 1800s, interior decoration was the concern in the homemaker, or even an employed upholsterer or craftsman who advise on the artistic style to have an interior space. Architects would likewise use craftsmen or artisans to complete decor for their buildings.",

,,,,,,,,,"Yaaqov Yosef (also, Jacob Joseph, יעקב יוסף‎ 1840 –July 28, 1902) served as chief rabbi of New York City's Association of American Orthodox Hebrew Congregations, a federation of Eastern European Jewish synagogues. Born in Krozhe, a province of Kovno, he studied in the Nevyozer Kloiz under Rabbi Yisrael Salanter and in the Volozhin yeshiva under the Netziv. In Volozhin, he was known as ""Rav Yaakov Charif"" (Rabbi Jacob Sharp) because of his sharp mind. He became successively rabbi of Vilon in 1868, Yurburg in 1870, Zhagory and then Kovno. His fame as a preacher spread, so that in 1883 the community of Vilna selected him as its maggid.

In the 1880s, the mainly Orthodox and Eastern European Ashkenazi Jewish community of New York wanted to be united under a common religious authority and founded the Association of American Orthodox Hebrew Congregations—comprising 18 congregations and headed by Beth Hamedrash Hagadol. They sent a circular offering the post throughout Eastern Europe. Rabbi Yaaqov Yosef was among those offered the position and, in 1888, accepted it. The Association attempted to create one central rabbinic authority in America. Without the support of other factions of the Jewish community and hostility from anti-religious groups, their idea ultimately failed. Although Joseph fought a losing battle in the kosher meat and poultry industry, he managed to achieve some notable accomplishments, including the hiring of qualified shoḥtim, introducing irremovable seals (""plumba"") to identify kosher birds, and setting up Mashgiḥim to oversee slaughter houses. He also took an active role in establishing the Etz Chaim Yeshiva—the first yeshiva on the Lower East Side, which was founded in 1886.

He wrote much of Sefer Hasidim (Book of the Pious), as well as a work about Gematria, and Sefer Hakavod (the latter mainly lost). Yehudah was descended from an old family of kabbalists from Northern Italy that had settled in Germany. His grandfather Kalonymus was a scholar and parnas in Speyer (died 1126). His father Shmuel, also called heḤasid, haKadosh, and haNavi, was president of a bet ha-midrash in Speyer, and from him Yehudah, together with his brother Abraham, received his early instruction. He founded a yeshiva in Regensburg and secured many pupils. Among those who became famous were Eleazar of Worms, author of the Roḳeaḥ; Isaac ben Moses of Vienna, author of Or Zarua; and Baruch ben Samuel of Mainz, author of Sefer ha-Ḥokmah. Eleazar applies to his teacher in several passages terms expressive of the highest esteem, such as ""father of wisdom"".

According to the rabbinic literature, Isaiah was a descendant of the royal house of Judah and Tamar (Sotah 10b). He was the son of Amōts (not to be confused with Prophet Amos), who was the brother of King Amaziah of Judah. (Talmud tractate Megillah 15a). Within the text of the Book of Isaiah, Isaiah himself is referred to as ""the prophet"", but the exact relationship between the Book of Isaiah and any such historical Isaiah is complicated. The traditional view is that all 66 chapters of the book of Isaiah were written by one man, Isaiah, possibly in two periods between 740 BCE and c. 686 BCE, separated by approximately 15 years, and includes dramatic prophetic declarations of Cyrus the Great in the Bible, acting to restore the nation of Israel from Babylonian captivity. Another widely-held view is that parts of the first half of the book (chapters 1–39) originated with the historical prophet, interspersed with prose commentaries written in the time of King Yoshiyahu (Josiah) a hundred years later, and that the remainder of the book dates from immediately before and immediately after the end of the exile in Babylon, almost two centuries after the time of the historic prophet.

In 1894 he founded in Philadelphia <em>Yudishes folks blat</em> (Jewish people’s newspaper), a biweekly published by the Mogilnitski Brothers and edited by Yoysef Mogilnitski, which came out for approximately one year.

Born in Żółkiew, Poland (now Ukraine) and raised in Vienna, he was interned in detention camps under the Vichy Regime but managed to flee the Nazi advance, emigrating to the United States in 1941. He was ordained as an Orthodox rabbi in 1947 within the ḤaBaD Hasidic movement while under the leadership of the sixth Lubavitcher Rebbe, Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn, and served ḤaBaD communities in Massachusetts and Connecticut. He subsequently earned an M.A. in psychology of religion at Boston University, and a doctorate from the Hebrew Union College. He was initially sent out to speak on college campuses by the Lubavitcher Rebbe, but  in the early 1960s, after experimenting with ""the sacramental value of lysergic acid"", the main ingredient in LSD, leadership within ḤaBaD circles cut ties with him. He continued teaching the Torah of Ḥassidut until the end of his life to creative, free and open-minded Jewish thinkers with humility and kindness and established warm ecumenical ties as well. In September 2009, he became the first contributor of a siddur to the Open Siddur Project database of Jewish liturgy and related work. Reb Zalman supported the Open Siddur Project telling its founder, ""this is what I've been looking forward to!"" and sharing among many additional works of liturgy, an interview he had with Havurah magazine in the early to mid-1980s detailing his vision of ""<a href=""http://opensiddur.org/development/press/database-davvenen-by-reb-zalman-schachter-shalomi-havurah/"">Database Davenen</a>.""

,,,,,,,,,"Zeraḥ ben Natan (Troki, Lithuania, 1586–1640) was a Karaite scholar with profound interest in Jewish philosophy, Kabbalah, and Karaite philosophy. He lived most of his life in Troki, although his family was originally from Birże (Lith.: Biržai) in northern Lithuania. As a young boy, he was tutored by the famed Karaite scholar Yitṣḥaḳ ben Abraham: decades later Zeraḥ would write to the famous Jewish printer Menasheh ben Yisra’el (1604–1657) in Amsterdam requesting him to print Yitṣḥaḳ ben Abraham’s polemic against Christianity, Ḥizzuḳ Emuna. In the headings of his poems, Zeraḥ is referred to as a ḥakham; he probably conducted some administrative and religious duties in the Karaite community of Troki. Most of his life, however, he was dedicated to an endless quest for knowledge. He collected an impressive library with both printed works and manuscripts. In 1618, he travelled to Istanbul, where he studied Kabbalah and secular sciences with the Turkish Karaites for two years. Back in Troki by the early 1620s, he began to correspond with the rabbinic scholar and polymath, Yosef Shelomo Delmedigo (Crete, 1591‒1655), who at the time was employed by the Prince Krzysztof Radziwiłł II (1585–1640) in Vilna. Zeraḥ poses intricate questions on mathematics, astronomy, medicine, Kabbalah, and theology in his letters, and these questions are published in Delmedigo’s highly influential scientific opus Sefer Elim (“The Book of Elim”, Amsterdam, 1629). Thus, Zeraḥ has become part of the early modern history of science among the European Jews. In addition to many extant poems both in Hebrew and in the Karaim language, he wrote a treatise on the medieval philosophical classic, Guide for the Perplexed by Moses Maimonides (1135–1204), and a Kabbalistic commentary on the Song of Songs. Zeraḥ died in 1657/8 at the age of seventy-nine.",
